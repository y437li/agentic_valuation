Franklin - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance Analysts : Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Q1 Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter conference call for Copart. Before I start, I'll turn it over to Will Franklin, our CFO for Safe Harbor statement and then we'll go ahead and give you an update on operations and some G&A and other factors before Q&A. Will? William E. Franklin: All right. Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our comments, I'd like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10-Q, 10-K and other SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Jay, for additional comments on our first quarter's results. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Will. Well, good morning again. As we talked about in the fourth quarter year, Copart completed the acquisition of Quad City Salvage Auctions, QCSA, and had our first full quarter in the first quarter. So I want to jump into some of the increases that you've seen in both G&A expense and in revenue and operating costs, so you can get some clarity about where we think will be in the second, third and fourth quarter of the year. Let's look at G&A. We finished Q1 with $38.5 million in G&A expense as opposed to $27.3 million for the same quarter a year ago. That's an increase of $11.2 million. That $11.2 million is basically divided into 3 buckets. International is up $1.7 million and that is associated with our expansion in the last year into Spain, Germany, Dubai and Brazil. That expense will be ongoing as we develop those markets further and grow further in those markets as part of our strategy for growth. On the -- as we look at the next bucket, let's look at information technology. On the IT side, Copart had an increase in the quarter of $4.7 million. This is associated with our move, our file move out of California. As we talked about in 2011, we began a project called Overdrive. And the whole concept was about really transforming our company, both from an operational, from a services level, moving out of California to Texas and upgrading our operating computer systems. That Project Overdrive will come to completion in July of 2014. And with it comes a brand-new website, with it comes a mobile application and we are continuing to work on a new operating system that will run the company. That has been delayed. So we are currently really have 2 things that are going on. We've got new systems. Let's use our website as an example. We're running the old website and we have the new website both up and running. We're carrying duplicate systems in many cases. And eventually when we finish that transition, we'll be down to 1 system for the web, 1 system for mobile, 1 system for operating the company and that will eliminate cost. The other big factor we have is the move out of California. So in this last quarter, we started transitioning folks from California into Dallas. And by the second quarter, which ends January 31, 2014, we'll have that completed. There will be no further technology employees in California. They will all be based in Dallas, Texas. And so there are a lot of expenses associated with severance and moving, et cetera, in the quarter. Will will give you color on how many of those are nonrecurring, what amount of those and quantifying the nonrecurring nature of those expenses. I just want you to know that that $4.7 million, the vast majority of that is from a standpoint of either the move or from a transition will not exist in the future. That's expense that we expect to have eliminated when we finish this transition process. On the QCSA front, that's the third bucket. We had G&A of $4.6 million. The majority of this will be eliminated as we start the integration. So when we purchased QCSA, we committed to our customers that we would not begin an integration for 6 months. In the second quarter, we will be implementing the integration of the company. And so the vast majority of that $4.6 million will be eliminated as we integrate the company. There are also one-time costs that are in there that Will will talk about as well. And that integration, to give you further color, we talked about it in the last quarter, but that integration will begin in Q2. It will continue into Q3 and should be finished by the end of Q3 but there will be some costs that run into Q4. But we're very confident at this point that there'll be no further integration of QCSA in fiscal '15. So from August 2014 on, we'll be done with the integration of QCSA and there'll be no more costs associated with moving personnel out of California when we look to the new fiscal year as well. All right. Let's look operationally. Inventories continue to be up. Inventory was up 20%, again in the quarter. Even with the increase of $41 million in revenues, revenues for the quarter finished at $279.9 million. Of the $41 million, $17.2 million of that was revenue associated with QCSA. There was literally no margin brought down to the bottom line on that $17.2 million. So the fact that we are -- have not integrated any of those facilities yet means we're literally towing a car 100 miles past one of our own locations, so that we can keep everything that is QCSA on its own, everything that is Copart on its own. Once we integrate the companies, that will cease to be the case. So those vehicles will be going to facilities that are maybe 5 miles away from the corner instead of 100 miles away. So you're going to see, as we talked about on the G&A front, a bunch of savings. You'll see the same savings on the operational front as we eliminate towing expense and other costs that we have associated with facilities. The best color I can give you on that is we would expect similar margins. This is going to be incremental vehicles flowing through to our facilities. So it should be similar margins once it is integrated to Copart as we've seen with Copart on existing business. Okay. The rest I'll leave for Q&A. I do want to mention that we acquired 1 auction facility in Montr\u00e9al, Canada recently. We now have 5 locations in Canada. And with that, I'll turn it over to Will Franklin for a financial review and then we'll open it up for question-and-answer. William E. Franklin: Thank you, Jay. As you can see, total revenue grew by $41 million. Purchased car revenue grew by $9.8 million. The Spain and QCSA acquisitions, both of which closed on our fourth quarter of last year, contributed $6.4 million to that growth. Purchased car revenue in the U.K. and the U.S. grew by $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The increase has resulted primarily from growth in our direct purchase program. In this program, we purchased cars primarily from the general public and resell them for our own accounts. Service revenue increased by $31.2 million. The increase resulted from growth in our international operations, which included acquisitions last year in Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil. These totaled approximately $4.1 million; growth in the U.K. of approximately $500,000; our QCSA acquisition of $12.2 million; and growth in Copart U.S. of $14.4 million. The growth in Copart U.S. came primarily from increased volume, resulting from growth in both market share and overall market size, as we have seen an increase in salvage frequency. In the U.S., volume grew by almost 7% as we saw increases from both our insurance and our noninsurance suppliers. Noninsurance car volume represented approximately 20% of our total Copart U.S. volume. In the U.K., total volume grew by approximately 10% and resulted primarily from market share gains. Yard operations expenses were up $27.9 million. The growth came as a result of our international expansion, the QCSA acquisition and its associated integration costs, which totaled approximately $9.1 million, the growth in Copart U.S. volume and the growth in Copart U.S. inventory. Copart U.S. inventory was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Included in the yard operation expenses for the quarter are approximately $800,000 in severance and lease termination and relocation costs. These costs will continue into our second and third quarters of this fiscal year. General and administrative costs grew by $11.2 million over the same quarter last year. The increase is due primarily to, as Jay mentioned, the additional cost tied to our international expansion, which totaled $1.9 million and will continue; a $4.6 million increase associated with QCSA acquisition, of which $1.1 million was lease and employment termination costs. These restructuring costs will continue into our second and third quarters. We expect the QCSA, general and administrative costs to be approximately $1.5 million per quarter when fully rationalized and additional spend in technology of approximately $4.7 million, of which $1.5 million was tied to relocation of our technology group from California to Texas. These costs will also continue into our second and third quarters. Also included in the $4.7 million increase are an estimated $1.5 million in transitional or duplicative costs associated with SAP rollout and the outsourcing of our technology infrastructure and level 1 support. These costs will continue into the next fiscal year. In total, we incurred approximately $2.9 million of severance, lease and relocation costs that are reflected in our G&A. We ended the quarter with over $77 million in cash. We expended $21.6 million for capital assets, capitalized software development costs and a buyout of 1 lease. During the quarter, we had no open market share repurchases. We have almost 48 million shares remaining in our current repurchase authorization. That concludes my comments. We'll turn the call back over to you, Debbie, for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Robert Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: I wanted to start with sales. Both this quarter and last, you discussed that total inventories are up about 20%. And last quarter, we talked a little bit about the apples-to-apples inventory growth as part of it and then also some cars staying on the yards a little bit longer due to processing time from the insurance company side. Can you give us a sense of the organic or apples-to-apples inventory growth in the quarter and how is the processing time? Is it normalizing yet? Where does that stand? Do you expect that excess inventory to flow through at any point? How should we think about that? A. Jayson Adair : Well, as we said on the last quarter, we felt about 1/2 of it was associated with improvements in inventory and 1/2 of it was associated with the cycle times on those vehicles. That -- I don't think there's an inherent trend. The cycle times are just getting longer and longer. There's some reasons why some of those vehicles hadn't moved based on the supply where they came from. And I expect those vehicles to start moving in the quarter that we're in and subsequent quarters Q3 and Q4. So we want to think about real inventory growth. It's probably closer to the 10% number. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Well, I mean, that's still obviously a fantastic number. And the primary drivers, I think you said, were both share gains and then the industry itself growing? Is there anything else behind that? A. Jayson Adair : I think it's important to understand the 20% number. We've got all the costs associated with that inventory build. So when that number does become more indicative of our growth more towards the 10%, we're going to have all the revenue associated without the expense when we sell those vehicles off. So that will be the improvement. And then to your second point, Bob, it really is just that it's an environment where the market is. We're seeing some market share gain and we're seeing some improvement in the overall market. Vehicles are older today than they were 5 years ago. New car sales have been down for the last 5 years. They're now starting to trend up but all those factors, as we talked about back in '09, if you recall in some of those conversations back in '09 after the '08 crash of the market, when we talked about in '09, vehicle sales stayed at these low ratios which they did that we see vehicles aging, which they have, and then we would see vehicles becoming more probable total losses, which is what we're seeing today. So the overall market, we believe, is just expanding. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay great. And then on the QCSA side, the revenues were strong in the quarter, certainly versus I guess what we're looking for there. And I know you're going to begin the transitioning going forward. Can you talk a little bit about some of the best practices that will be transferred between Copart and QCSA, the things you've learned from them and things you can impart on some of the yards you might keep of theirs if they're in the right places? A. Jayson Adair : Sure. Well, we're not going to be breaking out QCSA in every quarter, just so you know. The integration will start this quarter and then into Q3 and we'll just be talking about revenue. This is a -- you can see at $17.2 million you've got a real run rate of the revenues, so you've got that visibility. We won't be breaking that out in subsequent quarters. We'll be talking about the company as a whole as we integrate. The one I talked about in the call was towing; another one would just be all the duplicate facility expenses. I mean, they're running over 20 facilities that are right next door to our facilities, or I shouldn't say next door, but in the same markets as ours. So we may be driving right past one of our facilities to go to their facilities. That's the towing side, the other side is that you've got all the benefit of not having that facility expense, so there is that component. We've learned from both sides. They had some technology functions that we've now integrated into our company and will be launching at the integration on our website for our sellers. So there's been improvements there. There's been some improvements in just the way that they interact with the sellers. It's been new from some of the ways that we've done it. We've implemented some of those and then we've got a number of things that we do from a best class or best practices standpoint. We've got better cycle times and more efficient on the tows. We've got a much larger buyer base by a much bigger factor, so we expect higher returns on those vehicles as they get integrated. So it's just a number of areas where we've seen benefit on both sides and we've been able to integrate those benefits on Copart. When they've got something that they do better, we've taken advantage of that, so like I said, the technology piece. So really happy about it. I mean, I think I really -- I know we're going to be very pleased as we get into Q3. Q2 is still going to have a lot of costs in it but you'll start to see some of these benefits coming in, and Q3 and Q4 are going to look really good compared -- once we've got all these integrations completed. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : The first question is just a point of clarification in terms of the revenue -- sorry, the inventory build. Are you guys seeing more pressure from -- are you guys seeing more pressure from insurance companies to pick up vehicles more quickly to save them costs at the impound yard? A. Jayson Adair : That's always been the case. We tease because 20 years ago, it was -- the standard was 4-day pickup. And today, they want 24-hour pick up. Now they push for same-day pick up. So yes, we're always seeing push towards that and we've been able to improve year-after-year on cycle time and I suspect there's a point where you can't improve anymore, right? You can't go to 0. So at some point, we'll stop seeing that improvement. But with technology, it's allowed us to improve even further so we've got some tools that we use on the technology front that allows us to pick up vehicles in hours as opposed to next day, even. So that's -- we're always going to see a need for that because you have the impound yard as a big expense. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And then on the pricing front, if we do see a pull-back in used vehicle prices, is there an opportunity to potentially raise auction fee prices to kind of keep the fee revenue flat, if you will? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, we don't talk about pricing on calls, John. John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. If I can just end with one other. In the past you guys have clearly repurchased a lot of your shares. There's been a little bit of a lull, I mean, partly due to the REIT situation I would imagine, and then maybe QCSA. But going forward, I mean, do you see yourself going back into the market to repurchase a fair number of shares? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. Well, we don't talk about share repurchase on calls, either. You're 0 for 2 there, buddy. But no, we don't talk about share repurchase. We -- historically, you can see where we bought, we do have an authorization to buy plenty of stock and we have had a history of doing it. But as said on calls before, we tend not to lay our playbook out on when we think we should be buying stock back. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So I understand you don't talk about share repurchases. Perhaps I could try to approach it from a different angle. How do you currently feel about your financial leverage, which has been declining as you continue to make contractual payments on your debt and your earnings expand? A. Jayson Adair : Well, yes, we've got less debt than we had a couple of years ago. Again, we just don't get into those types of discussions on a conference call because it's not a CEO decision, that's a board decision. And when we get into how much debt we think we should have, we talk about that at the board level and then we make a release and let everyone know what we're thinking and what we're doing. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Great. And could you maybe just give us an update on your international operations outside of United Kingdom, so how some of your recent acquisitions have been tracking relative to original expectation, for example, in Brazil or the United Arab Emirates? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. We're really happy with them. There's a lot of opportunity in those markets and we want to move quickly, but you don't want to move too quickly or get too aggressive. So it's one of those things where we're integrating our process, our procedure and our systems. And it feels very similar to the U.K. When we came to the U.K. pickup times were triple what they are today. Returns were 30%, if not more than what -- less than what they are today. And so we see those markets as very similar to the U.K. and the potential and the opportunity being very similar to what we were able to do in the U.K. So we're happy about what's going on internationally. It's good stuff. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I see. And so was your intention to sort of use these international acquisitions to form kind of a beachhead in some of these markets after which you will then expand organically, or do you see yourself continuing to make multiple acquisitions in the same international market? Or aren't there really people to acquire in some of these? A. Jayson Adair : In some of the markets, there's no one to acquire, that's fair enough, and in other markets there's still acquisitions to be made and we would be open to that. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Last question this morning, at what time do you expect the QCSA margins to be up to the Copart levels and what are the steps that remain to get there? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. Fourth quarter, we're going to be integrating second and third. The margins should be up to par at fourth quarter. And then as I said on the call, there'll be some carryover from expenses in the third quarter that could go into the fourth quarter. But if you take that nonrecurring factor out, we'll be there in the fourth. Come the first quarter of the year, there shouldn't be any carryover expenses. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : A couple of quick questions. I guess, we're looking at QCSA in sort of how, in the future, when we've adjusted for the duplicative overhead and the buckets, could you give us some color on how the gross margin profile of the charity or toys business compares to the core insurance category? Is that diluted to the overall mix? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, sure. I won't give you the actual numbers. The toys is better than salvage because they tend to be higher sale price, higher-margin units. Charity are less than insurance. If you think about the profitability of segments, if you will, or supply in our business, at the top of the food chain would be rental cars, dealer cars, non-damaged stuff. Then you'd move down into damaged vehicles, then you'd move down into charity vehicles, which typically are not damaged, but they just have really low valuations in terms of profitability per unit. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then a question on the market share comment. I guess I'm trying to figure out what a real inventory growth is versus share growth versus the underlying slowdown in the processing. Where do you see the share coming from? I guess what do you see being the driver of market share shifts right now at the market? A. Jayson Adair : Well, there's been a consolidation in the market in the last year. Quite a few of the large suppliers, large insurance companies, have made a decision to go with 2 vendors or 3 vendors and eliminate doing business with 17 vendors as an example. So... Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : So this is the outcome of the RFP process we saw a year, 18 months ago? A. Jayson Adair : Say that again? Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : So this is the result of the RFPs that were -- that we were seeing 12 or 18 months ago. A. Jayson Adair : Sure. And we're always looking at RFPs, I mean that's pretty regular but there was a pretty major shift in the last year that pushed a lot of business towards 2 or 3 suppliers or auctions and eliminated -- where they eliminated doing business with some of the smaller players that are out there. The other side, just as we said, the markets -- the industry is expanding. It's getting bigger. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : One question, I guess, on the QCSA, the charity volume is going through vehicle revenues or is that going through service revenues? A. Jayson Adair : Both. William E. Franklin: Goes to both. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then one last question. Your next board meeting, is that in the mid-December, I guess we're -- I was reading the proxy and it looks you may be extending your dollar-a-year contract. Is the next meeting the 16, for the board? William E. Franklin: Shareholder meeting. A. Jayson Adair : The shareholder meeting is yes, the 16th. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. When's the next board meeting? A. Jayson Adair : The next board meeting is next week. Operator : We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Well, Will, did you give a total volume number for the year -- for the quarter year-over-year that you are up or do you ever give that number? William E. Franklin: No, I didn't. I gave the U.S. and I gave the U.K. separately because... Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : If you don't give it, that's fine. There's just a lot of questions have been answered, but just could you maybe make some comments on how you're doing in the dealer and the public markets? Obviously, you're adding to QCSA, you've got a lot more salvaged vehicles in the mix, but yet you're still doing about 20%, was it non-salvage? So that's obviously growing at a pretty good clip, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that. A. Jayson Adair : No, I mean you're spot on. I mean, that's exactly what's happened and they've continued to be able to improve that part of the business. And I anticipate that will be the case. The noninsurance business is a very large segment for us. We handle a very small piece of that. We've got a really good sales team that are working that now. That business has existed now, this is its sixth year that we've had the dealer division and a direct division, so I expect that they'll continue to do well for years ahead. I don't see that coming to maturity for a while. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Could you maybe share what the volume growth is there year-over-year? Is that too intrusive? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, we don't break out volume, Gary, but we do break out the percentage of the business. As you said, it's about 20%. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And how many dealers are you dealing directly with now, can you tell us that? A. Jayson Adair : Thousands. I don't know the exact number. It's thousands of dealers. Operator : We'll go next to Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just a follow on to Gary's question on the noninsurance side. Jay, I would think that your platform would be particularly strong in the buy here, pay here market. Do you have a specific initiative to get after opportunities there? A. Jayson Adair : We are. We're -- I tend not to like to talk about all those segments because, again, we've got a lot of competition out there but we work all those angles. So rest assured now, I won't get into each market out there like buy here, pay here that we go after, but we're involved in all those markets as potential supply for vehicles. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then I know you're investing in a new website. To what extent do you think that is a game changer on the consumer side, or you've maybe had a lot of hits on your new website, but maybe it's not as intuitive as you'd like it to be? A. Jayson Adair : It's a big deal. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I did talk about them on the last quarter. But it's double-digit growth year-over-year and people attending auctions, auction attendance, it's double-digit growth in new registration, so it's a big deal. The old site which is currently the existing site, you have to sign up, you have to register to join an auction. And the new site, which is currently beta and we will be replacing the old site in the coming months, once we've worked out everything. And we want to make sure it goes out completely bug-free and stronger than the existing site. But -- so in the months ahead as we launch that, you don't have to register to be -- attend an auction. You can jump in, watch an auction and so you learn much more about our business when you see the vehicles sell. We sold a Ferrari, an F50 Ferrari last, what, 2 weeks ago, something like that. It sold for $455,000. We put a video of it up on YouTube. It got over 100,000 views and you can just type in Copart F50 Ferrari, you can find it, it's really easy to find. And you can watch the auction. We've posted the auction up on YouTube as well. So that kind of stuff where the visibility of what we do and then being able to come in to our site and actually watch auctions and not have to register, that registration process for people can be a pretty big barrier and we've eliminated that. That's just one example on the new site. If you go back a year ago, we didn't have auction access on our mobile site. So today you can watch an auction from your phone. Over 10% of our auctions are attended via mobile. I know those are some big numbers, when you think about what we're selling every day, how many people are attending. Over 10% of the attendance is coming in through the mobile platform as opposed to the web. So those are just improvements that we think are going to be a big deal going forward, Craig. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then the final question, just on the international strategy. It's my understanding your business really tends to flourish once you've achieved an upscale, like in the U.S. and the U.K. but your more recent international investments, you've got let's say subscale investments in Germany, Brazil, Spain, Dubai, Canada. Why spread it out like that instead of consolidating and really getting that scale that tends to drive that better economics? A. Jayson Adair : Well, we've got the teams to do it. We've been investing in bringing people on over the last 4 years so that we'd have the personnel to expand in the multiple markets. We've got the cost associated with it. There's no question about it but we look at that as short-term pain, long-term gain. We'll have some of that expense that we're carrying while we are in markets without an upscale and your -- I think your point's well taken. We will then start to build scale in those markets. And instead of having one market come on and then go to another, we'll have 4 markets coming on and then we'll expand from there into multiple markets. So it's just -- we just feel like it's, in the long-term, a much better strategy to getting across the globe. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Most of mine have been answered, but can you remind me, do you disclose same-store sales anymore? William E. Franklin: No, we didn't, but same-store sales are up 7%. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Up 7%. Okay. William E. Franklin: In North America, yes. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : That's just North America, not U.K.? William E. Franklin: That's Copart U.S. Operator : Gentlemen, with that, there are no other questions in queue. A. Jayson Adair : All right. Thank you, Debbie. Again, thank you, everyone, for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter when we report on the second quarter for Copart. Happy Thanksgiving and we'll talk to you then. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division John M. Healy - Northcoast Research Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Copart, Inc. Q2 Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter conference call for fiscal '14. I'm going to turn it over to Will Franklin, who will do Safe Harbor, go through his prepared remarks, turn it back to me for some brief remarks, and then we'll do Q&A. Will? William E. Franklin: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10-Q, 10-K and other SEC filings. With that, I'll begin with a few brief comments about the financial results of our quarter. Total revenue grew by $20.2 million. Purchased car revenue grew by $1.4 million, driven primarily by growth in Europe. Service revenue increased by $18.8 million. The increase resulted from growth in our international operations, which included the acquisitions in Germany, Spain, United Arab Emirates and Brazil of approximately $1.1 million; growth in the U.K. of $5.2 million, which was tied to recent market share gains; and $12.5 million in Copart U.S. In the second quarter of last fiscal year, we had an additional extraordinary revenue as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Excluding the Sandy impact, we calculate Copart U.S. service revenue grew by $29.3 million or 16.5%. Total worldwide sales volume increased 10.9%. In the U.S., total volume increased 10.1%. Excluding the Sandy impact, total U.S. sales volume grew by 18.3%. In the U.K., volume increased over 22%. In the U.S., on a same-store sales basis and excluding the impact of Hurricane Sandy, volume grew by almost 8%, as we are seeing growth in both our market share, as well as growth in overall market size, as salvage frequency, we believe, is increasing. In the U.K., our same-store sales volume increased 22%, as all growth came from market share wins and market growth. In North America, noninsurance car volume grew by over 22% and represented 19.5% of the total volume. Sales continues to lag behind the build in inventory. On a year-over-year basis, our North America inventory grew by 14.2%. Excluding the Sandy impact, it grew by 27.3%. In the U.K., our inventory grew by almost 17%. Yard operation expenses were up $5.3 million. The growth was driven by increased volume and, excluding the impact of Sandy, which added approximately $20 million in extraordinary cost in our results in the same quarter last year, we saw an increase in overall cost to process each car. The growth in processing costs, excluding Sandy, were driven by : The growth in our international activity outside of the U.K., as these operations are in their developmental stages without the benefit of scale; the additional cost associated with the QCSA migration with its inefficiencies and which included lease termination, severance and relocation costs of $2.2 million; and a general increase in our subhaul and employee cost. The growth in employee costs were led primarily by increased medical insurance cost. We expect to continue to rationalize existing QCSA cost as we adopt the most efficient plan for processing its volume. We expect lease termination, relocation and severance cost to continue into our fourth quarter. General and administrative costs grew by $6.3 million over the same quarter last year. The increase was due primarily to additional costs tied to our international expansion, which totaled $900,000 and which will continue; a $3.7 million increase associated with the QCSA acquisition, of which $500,000 was for severance and relocation. These restructuring costs will continue into our third and fourth quarters. We expect the QCSA general and administrative cost to be approximately $1.5 million per quarter when fully rationalized, and approximately $1.8 million in relocation and severance costs associated with relocation of our technology group from California to Texas. In total, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in severance, lease termination and relocation costs, of which $2.2 million is reflected in our yard fleet cost and $2.3 million was reflected in our G&A cost for the quarter. We ended the quarter with over $46 million in cash. We expended approximately $30 million for capital assets, primarily for the expansion of existing facilities to accommodate the growth in inventory. Also included in the $30 million is the buyout of 2 of our existing leases. Finally, we expended approximately $14 million for 2 acquisitions. During the quarter, we had no open market share repurchases. We have almost $48 million remaining in our current repurchase authorization. That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Jay Adair for more color on the quarter. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Will. Again, good morning, everyone. As you can see, we've had a really, really big year and a really big quarter. The first thing I'll talk about this morning, really, is just inventory builds, but the company would typically see winter inventory peaking some time in mid-January. We have peaked right now at February 12. And as of Monday, the 24th, that inventory is down about 1% from the peak. So we would typically expect to be down significantly, but we just continue to see large, large volume. The volume that was assigned Monday and Tuesday this week already far away exceeds what we would normally be doing. So it's a combination, as Will already discussed, of volume coming in from increasing market share, from increasing market size, from QCSA and from weather. And I'm sure there will be some questions on the breakout of those mixes. Some of it is easy to tell because we had the acquisition of QCSA. Some of it's very, very difficult to tell, like weather and market size or market size growth. We did see some large improvements in market share last year as the industry consolidated more towards 2 players. And we saw a number of smaller companies in the industry lose business to both us and our competitor. So it's been a good year from that perspective. It's also been a very big year for transition. So as Will discussed, we have completely moved now our operations from California, and we are completely focused on getting the team that's running in Dallas at optimal performance. So we are really enjoying having everybody in one building again and having that transition that we talked about back in '11 with Project Overdrive behind us. So really, when I think about where we're going to be in this quarter, we're going to have record number of units being sold, record revenues with respect to same quarter a year ago, even though we had Sandy involved. And then Q4 is just going to be a very, very big, big quarter as well because eventually, this inventory that we've got does have to go out. We've got existing locations of 183 locations. Currently, we acquired QCSA back in May with 39 locations. I wanted to give you an update on that. We added, out of the 39 locations, we have taken advantage of using 20 of those locations. But in doing that, we only have 11 new stores. And the way that we handle that, basically, was we turned 9 of those locations into sublots. These are yards that are, for instance, 10 acres where we take that facility, we keep that facility, we store cars at that facility, but we don't put a building on it, we don't staff it as a full-on operating facility with all the costs associated. So we've got a number of sublots across the company at various locations as we expand. And often, you'll see CapEx for acquired land and improvement of that land, but we don't necessarily add additional locations, and that's because we handle that through subplot expansions. And sometimes, you do that through adjacent expansion of property right next to our yard. So out of the 39 locations, we utilized 20 stores, 20 locations. 11 of those are new locations for the company, 9 are sublots and roughly 19 of those locations have been eliminated. So we've gone through the process of exiting leases, moving cars and doing that. There's a lot of costs in this quarter and next quarter associated with that transformation. And then we've also got the process of moving the home office functionality to Copart and eliminating the HQ for QCSA. That business or that division, that HQ is reduced to about 20%, from 100% in May in this quarter. So there's a little bit that'll trail into Q3 and a small bit that'll trail into Q4, both in G&A and in operational expense. But we expect to have the integration of QCSA completed by the end of the fiscal year. Also in the quarter, we made an acquisition in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, bringing our total locations in Canada now to 5. And that really concludes my remarks. I'm going to go ahead and open it up for questions because I'm sure there'll be a number of questions around the growth that we've seen in the quarter. David? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Would you happen to have the same-store inventory growth for North America? That might clarify things a little bit for us. William E. Franklin: It's a little -- it's in excess of the same-store sales. It's around 10%, I believe. But let me get that number and confirm it before we exit the call. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And to clarify that inventory, that's not balance sheet inventory. That's just the number of vehicles you have in your lots, right, whether they're owned or whether -- and most of them, obviously, being consigned. William E. Franklin: That's correct. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Jay, just to clarify... William E. Franklin: Bill, I've got that number. It's closer to 14% on a same-store sales basis. And what I was referring the 10% -- a part of that 14% growth is attributable to delayed cycle time, processing time. So our days in inventory have increased. So the part of that growth that's ascribed to -- well, the market share growth is about 10%, 10.5%. William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I see, okay. And on QCSA, just so I have this straight, you bought 39 locations, 19 have been eliminated, 9 have been turned into sublots and then 11 are just operating as they were? Is that -- do I have that right? A. Jayson Adair : It's actual new stores. So we were able, in some scenarios, to take existing Copart -- I'll give you Sacramento as a prime example. They had a location in Sac, we had location in Sac. We were able to move all of that business over to that location and not have an additional store and not need an additional sublot. So that would be the ones where we've actually done away with that property that we had in Sacramento. So 19 locations have been given back to landlords, 11 locations are new actual yards for the company and 9 of the locations we kept because we needed capacity, we needed the land and they have been turned into sublots. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: I wanted to start on the IT side. And maybe you could just remind us the scope of the projects and the timing for the projects you're working on. I'm talking more about the outsourcing of your internal ERP and then also about moving to VB3 in foreign languages and stuff like that. Just give us a sense of the goals there, the costs you have ahead of you and then the future benefits you expect to get when these are all wrapped up. A. Jayson Adair : Sure. Well, that project started at the beginning of Overdrive. There was a delay that was caused because of the move, making the decision to move the company. There was another delay that was caused by then finally moving all of the technology team to Dallas. So I hate hindsight because I didn't have hindsight 3 years ago. But in hindsight, I probably would have just moved everybody up front and not put off that move. But that team has been successful in delivering the new third-generation technology on the mobile platform, the new third-gen VB3 technology on copart.com, on our new website. That website has been in beta for roughly 6 months. If you go back to Copart 10 years ago, we would have launched a new website and put it in, and we just can't do that kind of stuff today. We do way too much volume and have too much -- too many transactions to just kind of hotshot something in. So that's been in beta. We have modified, my goodness, over 100 new things on the site in the last 6 months, and we're coming out of beta now. We would expect to close beta down next month. So we would expect that our current website be replaced in Q3, no later than Q4, with the new website. And that new website has multi-layers [ph], so a number of new functions, third-generation option technology, multi-language capabilities, much more user-friendly. I would just encourage you to go to both sites, and it pops. It's very obvious why we're rolling out the new site. It's a much better product. So that will be taking place this fiscal year. There'll be some enhancements coming in the new fiscal year to both mobile and to copart.com, and that will continue. It's written in the most modern language, in the most modern architecture. And so it really is a state-of-the-art system. So that's exciting. The ERP side, we will be launching -- our expectation is to launch a yard in this calendar year, not fiscal, but calendar year, and have that system in place. And then we will be rolling 1 yard at a time, the same way that we implemented the new system back in '97. We're not going to do a hard cut over and convert 183 locations, and 6 or 7 countries to 1 system. So we'll be going 1 yard at a time. And having costs associated with that, you obviously have to carry the cost of a legacy system and the new system as you do it. But we feel that's the right way to handle a transition like that. So there won't be any material improvements to operating costs in the next -- in this fiscal year or the next fiscal year with respect to technology, as we're rolling that technology in and then transferring from legacy to the new system, the new ERP system. And then, what you'll see is the elimination of duplicate costs in having a beta website, in duplicate costs of having a legacy system and a new operating system. And that, I would suspect, will happen fiscal '16. So we haven't really -- right now, our focus is getting Quad Cities and DVAA integrated. We will have that done by the end of the year. As I said, we've really already done QCSA. That's integrated with the small bits that we've got to do on the G&A front, and then DVAA will come in towards the end of the fiscal year. So that's been the focus this last year because of that large acquisition we made in May, also the large market share gains we've been spending a lot on expanding yards, existing locations and integrating all of these facilities that we've talked about because volumes are up significantly, as you heard, from inventory and current sales. I mean, the fact that we're selling more volume and higher revenues this year when we had Hurricane Sandy a year ago, if you'd asked me that on a call a year ago, I would've said, \"That's not going to happen.\" And for us to be in that position, that was definitely unexpected. So our focus has been on existing volumes, existing customers, integrations of those companies, transformation of -- or transition of the company from California to Dallas, and then this transformation piece of technology. And that has been delayed a bit and -- but it will be coming. So you can expect us to talk about it in fiscal '15, as we're not dealing with integrations and such, we'll talk about technology transformation in '15 and fiscal '16. William E. Franklin: And Jay, let me add another comment on that issue. So we'll be utilizing that ERP system for not only operations, but for our financial reporting. And the rollout of those 2 functions are not necessarily linked. And in fact, we've had a successful installation of the financial system, SAP financials in Germany. And we expect to be rolling that out during the course of the next 4 quarters. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. That was very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then just one more question. Back to the volume increase and the inventory increase, you talked about for the last couple of quarters the cycle time difference. Has there been any change there? Or do you expect that to catch back up at some point? Have you identified what has caused it? Or can you just put a little more color around that, and when you think you'll get more in sync of bringing cars in and getting them out the same pace you used to? A. Jayson Adair : Well, they really are. The cycle times are up, but they're not up -- I could -- we can look that up while we're sitting here chatting and come back to you on the call. I want to tell you, they're not up in some huge, huge way. But I'll quantify it for you here in a minute by looking it up. The vast majority of the volume increase or the inventory increase is assignments, where we're doing record assignments through November, December, January and now, February. The numbers I looked at from Monday and Tuesday are way ahead of what we thought we'd be seeing by now. Volume should be dropping off, inventory should be selling. That's the normal part of the business, and we're not seeing that right now. We're just seeing a continued increase in volume. And so we are selling the cars. We had a record month in January. But we also had a record inventory build in January because so many assignments are coming in. So let me quantify it for you in a minute what the cycle time change has been so that you can get a feel for that. But I'm just telling you, the majority of the inventory build is volume. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to focus on the 27.3% year-over-year increase in inventories x Sandy because I know that's a very large increase and also that it has the potential to depress your earnings during the quarter, but boost your earnings in subsequent quarters. So firstly, I presume that 27.3% increase includes the impact of -- yes, can you hear me? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. We just -- we got -- I'm sorry, we got chatting a little bit on the very beginning when you [indiscernible], so I wanted to make sure we were talking to the right guy. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes, yes. No, sure. I presume the 27.3% increase includes the impact of QCSA. Can you say how much inventory would have increased x QCSA? William E. Franklin: Well, we did. It was that same-store sales inventory growth asked earlier, which was about between 10%, 11%. And... Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And do you know -- yes. William E. Franklin: Excluding the impact, at least my calculations of the impact of cycle time and for QCSA, and excluding Sandy, it's between 10%, 11%. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. So still very strong. Do you know how much the overall industry might have increased during that period of time x Sandy? A. Jayson Adair : That's the question we knew we'd get, and it's very hard to put your hands around that. The inventory is increasing because the average age of vehicles is increasing. So the number of units that are totaling, we believe, is going up. And we believe it's going up because vehicles are aging, but it's also going up right now because of weather. The U.S. is seeing some significant weather, and that's creating an environment where we're getting volumes way late in the year. To peak on February 12, it just doesn't happen. We peak in January. So I can just tell you that Q3 and Q4 are going to have record, record revenues associated with selling off that inventory. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. So maybe we can't say how much it rose, but it's safe to conclude that it rose substantially less than 10% to 11%. William E. Franklin: What's the conclusion -- what's the question you just asked? What... Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : We may not able to say how much the overall industry rose, but it's safe to say it rose substantially less than 10% to 11%. William E. Franklin: I think that's safe. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes. You mentioned that there was this salvage auction market share consolidation in 2013. Can you just kind of state sort of the reasons why the industry consolidated in 2013 benefiting you and your primary competitor? Was this due to some sort of overarching trend or would it be the purposeful -- go ahead. A. Jayson Adair : Well, no, I was just going to answer for you. I mean, there's just a benefit to having scale in this business. There's a benefit with respect to pricing, there's a benefit with respect to returns. I mean, I was looking at auctions yesterday, we got 1,500 members watching and bidding on the auctions. I mean, you're just -- you're not going to get 1,500 people to show up to a location when you're a single operator. So it's just a benefit of being the portal. You're going to go find your product at the biggest players in the market. And when you're an independent small guy, you're just not going to -- you're going to struggle to get the returns and you're not going to have any scale. I mean, we're talking about investing tens of millions of dollars in technology annually. And the amount we invest in technology in a quarter is more than these guys generate in revenue in a year. So how do you -- that's not a boastful statement by any stretch, that's just a factual statement. How do you compete with the investment and generating the technology, the returns and then being competitive on price? It becomes very, very difficult to do that. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes. So that seems more like a longer-term overarching trend, but was there maybe a purposeful scaling back by a specific competitor or an exit of a competitor that benefited you in sort of a step change [indiscernible]? A. Jayson Adair : Really, there was a number of RFPs that took place last year. And we gained in those RFPs and candidly, our competitor gained in those RFPs. It was much more a consolidation of the market. And there were a number of RFPs that took place with large carriers, with large suppliers. And so that's just the reality of what happened. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And are you able to say when in the year that you began to benefit from this? Because I'm trying to just sort of figure out when you'll anniversarize the increase for modeling purposes. A. Jayson Adair : No, I understand. No, it happened. There were a number of RFPs that took place, I'm thinking over 5 off the top of my head, and they happened throughout the year. So -- and part of it is that, part of it is the weather, part of it is the improvement in the market. The best indicator to me of what we're going to be selling in the future is just look at accounts receivable. And you can see, sequentially, for the last 8 quarters, what's happened with accounts receivable for the company, and it's just gone up and up and up as we're sitting on a record number of cars right now, and those cars have to sell. They're starting to sell. Monday and Tuesday, we saw record sales. So they're starting to sell now and they're going to be going out in the third and the fourth quarter. Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just very last question. Is there anything you can sort of say about your newer operations outside the U.S. and the United Kingdom during the quarter outside North America and the United Kingdom? I know after you made your initial acquisition of Universal in the U.K., you were sort of on the ground, you learned the markets and then you decided you wanted to fill in, in different areas. I mean, as you're -- on the ground in those markets now, are you sort of learning anything different or do you want to [indiscernible]? A. Jayson Adair : It's the same. It's the same strategy that we deployed in the U.K. We entered the U.K. '07 and you saw a good 3 years before we really started to acquire and integrate and implement our process. So that's the same kind of scenario that we've got in these other markets. We've entered them in the last year, and it will be a few years before we see us going out and building the network, doing the things that we need to do, no different than the U.K. But as you also heard from the numbers, the U.K. is a booming market for us as is the U.S. So these other markets, we suspect, they will be similar. And as we go out and we start to deploy our suite of services, we expect to be successful in those markets the same way we have in the U.S. and the U.K. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : A couple of quick questions. If we look at the comp inventory growth, did it grow sequentially in the quarter, I guess, as we take out Sandy and new points-of-sale? William E. Franklin: Yes, it always grows in our second quarter. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. But it's -- and I guess as we look at the slowing processing and that's -- and I might have missed this earlier, is that related to the high rate of inventory growth, just we would normalize the processing pace as we decelerate inventory growth? William E. Franklin: What slowing process are you referring to? Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : The cycle time, that you were discussing earlier, being somewhat slower. William E. Franklin: Yes, there's a lot of reasons for the increase in cycle time. But a lot of it is just because of the increased volume and the limited resources that the interested companies had to clear the cars. So at some point, they'll catch up with the resources to the volume. Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then one last question on Quad City. Is the integration of Quad City taking longer than expected? I guess, as we're looking at your spending continuing into the fourth quarter, is that something that was originally factored into your model? Or is that a slower process than had been expected? A. Jayson Adair : No, not at all. It's going perfectly just as we planned. We said in the last quarter that there'd be costs associated with QCSA in Q2 and Q3, and that is still the case. There's going to be the majority of the expenses will be Q2 and Q3, and we won't be discussing in Q4 any of the nonrecurring expenses. But there will be a tail. There will be some nonrecurring expense in Q4. It won't be a perfectly clean quarter like Q1. That was the point of the opening remarks and the press release. Just to let you know, there'd be some impact in Q4, but it's relatively small compared to Q2 and Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from John Lawrence with Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Could you give us -- Jay, to follow that question, as far as last quarter, you gave us the buckets of how those charges would fall and when they would start rolling off. Will, you just mentioned on Quad City's on the other sort of systems related, does there seem that there's a little bit of extension on that timeframe? And could you quantify that just a little bit, please? William E. Franklin: Well, it's difficult to quantify it on a quarterly basis because they're contingent on certain events, particularly with the severance and the relocation costs. So I think we'll just leave it at what we said so far, is that we've gone through the majority of those costs and we've identified them in the last 2 quarters. But we'll have some tail in our third quarter and perhaps into our fourth. But we would not expect them to be near the size that we've incurred so far. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Yes. And secondly, you've mentioned in the last couple of quarters about towing costs. Anything there on some of these contracts that have -- with all this volume. A. Jayson Adair : So, yes, towing goes up when you have a lot of volume like this. I mean, that shows that, that's a normal part of the business. If tomorrow the volumes halved -- which that can happen. But if tomorrow the volumes halved, you'd have a lot more towers than you have cars and the cost of towing would come down. When the volume goes up so dramatically, you've got towers working a lot harder and then you've got to bring new towers in, so your cost could go up. So part of it -- a big part of it is just the volume increase. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Right. And last question from me... A. Jayson Adair : And I want to make sure we're clear on something, it's not going up materially. A material increase in towing cost would be Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Sandy, we were paying out silly rates to get cars picked up because you flood the Northeast with 80,000 cars in a month, and it's a market that does 80,000 cars in 2 years. So that kind of experience is what we saw a year ago. What we're seeing now is just a modest increase in cost as we see increased volume. John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And the last question, any thoughts or can you comment at all on stock buyback here? A. Jayson Adair : No, no comments at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : A lot of my questions have been answered. But Will, do you have in front of you what the revenues you derived last year in Q3 from Sandy, as well as Q4? William E. Franklin: I don't have -- no, I don't have it in front of me, but I can provide that offline. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, I'll circle back to you. And then Jay, any comments on what's going on with returns and pricing in the market? I mean, the Manheim index has come down a little bit. We're starting to hear that used car values are slipping, albeit not that dramatically. But are you still deriving record return on salvage at this juncture? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. Returns started to dip towards the end of the calendar year. They've gone up week after week after week in a row since really exiting the holidays. So from the beginning of the year to where we're at today, we keep seeing record weeks. This week, again, is producing record return on pricing. So that is indicative of the last 4 years. '08, we saw a dramatic drop. We know what happened in '08. '09 was a year of trying to recovery -- of trying to recover. And then since 2010, we have seen this increase, this uptick in returns that happens around February. And this year, it started in January. And again, the sales we had this week have continued to be higher -- the highest returns we've seen all year. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, do you feel that -- this is basically an oligopoly now at this point, but do you feel there's further consolidation opportunities for you in terms of whatever little is left within the industry being divvied up between the 2 major players? A. Jayson Adair : I want to make sure I understand the question. We were passing some notes when you started on that... Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : I'll repeat it again. Just in the terms of further consolidation, I mean, one large competitor lost some business on RFPs. I mean, as you're talking to the insurance companies, are they more in tune with dealing with companies like yourself or your larger competitor versus being with these smaller regional or 2-site, 1-site players that are local? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, there's no question that, that's the case. You just -- as I said in some of the earlier remarks, when you're a small player in this market, you just can't get the scale. You don't have the revenues to generate or to invest in technology, you don't have the ability to generate in facility improvements, you don't have the ability to bring the buyers in. You can't get enough eyes to look at your product, you can't generate the returns. So yes, by and large, there may be a tiny, tiny contingent of clients that don't see that. But I'm not aware of who they are. Everybody recognizes at this point that scale is critical to generating returns and having the best products. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Could you just maybe give us a comment on, if you could, given over the past 1.5 years, 2 years what's happened with the industry, just how much you have increased your buyer base in salvage? Is that possible? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. I can run next door real quick and get some of those numbers. I don't have them off the top of my head. And we're trying to get the cycle time number for, I think, Bob asked that one earlier. Let me hold on that and see if we can't get that before the call ends and talk about growth in number. We're selling -- we're just selling -- I know off the top of my head, we're just selling a lot more product to a much more distributed buyer base, meaning, buyers that haven't been here a year or less than 2 years. So we'll find out what that is and I'll announce that on the call. William E. Franklin: Gary, I've got the answer to your previous question about Sandy revenue. So in Q3, it was about $12.7 million. Q4 is about $2.7 million. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : I wanted to ask about the -- yes. A. Jayson Adair : John, if I could just touch on one of these points before we get into your question. So we talked about cycle time and, in fact, the cycle times increased. We need -- we have to get another data point, but I'll give this one out. Our cycle time right now is the same as the cycle time was year-to-date for the company, so year-to-date 2013. So the cycle time that we're running right now is the same for that. That number is a little artificially high because of Sandy. So I'm going to find out what our cycle time was in Sandy, find out what our cycle time was mid-year, and then we'll get that data out to you guys. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : I wanted to ask a little bit about the vehicle sales line. The revenue growth there kind of slowed a little bit. And I was wondering, I guess 2 parts to that, was that by design? And potentially, if I take some of your other comments, it looks like you invested a lot into real estate this quarter and including kind of converting some of the QCSA operations, are we at a point where the company needs to undergo more investments into yards? You've garnered share and the industry's increasing. And might we expect that CapEx number to be somewhat higher than we've seen over the next few quarters. A. Jayson Adair : Yes. So right now, as we're sitting right now in this quarter, we're not spending a lot on CapEx because a lot of that was deployed in the second quarter. But we have authorized the improvement of a dozen facilities in the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year. I wouldn't say it's abnormally high from what I've looked at. We expect this inventory to come out. We expect this inventory to sell off, and that would give us further capacity. So I don't -- look, as I'm sitting here looking at the business today, I don't see some huge need to spend a lot of capital on facilities, barring the fact that the industry starts to grow at a much faster rate. So right now, we know the industry is growing because cars are older. But I think the majority of what we're seeing right now is weather-related. But if that starts to -- in the next year, we start to see the industry growing at a higher rate, then we're going to have more volume coming in, we're going to need more capacity. And if that happens, we'll discuss it. And let you guys know what kind of -- and that's a good thing. I hope that happens. If we end up having to deploy capital expanding 50 locations, because we've got that kind of volume coming up, that would be a dramatic improvement for the company. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : I would agree. And I just wanted to ask -- just follow up on the vehicle sales line. Was there anything to call out there that caused the growth rate to come down a bit there? A. Jayson Adair : Caused the growth rate on... William E. Franklin: Purchased car revenue. No, it's just the normal fluctuations. It was primarily in North America. So we had a reduction at the Copart level, an increase in purchased car revenue that we inherited from QCSA, and they pretty much mitigated each other. So what that left us with was some growth out of -- primarily Spain. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : Okay. And I just wanted to ask, I might have missed it, but is there a way you guys could quantify just how much revenue you got from QCSA this quarter and maybe what the operating profit contribution was, even including some of the severance and integration costs? William E. Franklin: No. I think we'll probably stay away from that because QCSA, frankly, is starting to lose identity. We're starting to process a lot of its cost in 2 different systems. And to give you a number would be to make some assumptions that I don't think we want to do in a call. A. Jayson Adair : Let me add a little color on that as well. We have integrated the QCSA team into Copart. And we've got some really, really fantastic people now that are part of our sales group, our maintenance group, our operations group. So we're really happy about that component of it. The costs that we're eliminating here are not the value add, they're the processing costs of moving a vehicle a long distance into a facility when you've got -- they may have had a facility that was 80 miles away and Copart's 20 miles away. So the cost that we're ripping out of the system are all wasted duplicate costs like that, paying rent on a facility when we already have a facility, towing a car too far. There's some lack of scale in having duplicate facilities that you get when you have one store. But all the great people that came through the acquisition, most of them -- most of those folks have relocated to Dallas. And those that have not are still in Iowa, which was the home office. We've kept that facility as a processing center for the company. And in fact, we've staffed up that facility and moved some jobs into that market as well. So from that perspective, we're really, really happy. We got the integration where we want it, we've got people now on our team that are bringing value, things that QCSA did that we feel were better and we've implemented those at Copart. And so it's becoming the Copart brand, but the Copart brand is shifting a little more towards what the QCSA brand was like, if that makes any sense. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Many of the quarterly-related questions have been taken. So Jay, maybe I'll switch into some longer-term questions. There are certainly some big trends related to industry consolidation, the aging vehicle population, even accident avoidance technology. I'm curious what you think, 5 years from now, all of those trends mean for industry volume and your share of it. A. Jayson Adair : Yes. We've talked so much about that trying to get our hands around it. I've even shared with some CEOs in the body shop industry, some of the large body shop groups and the CEO of LKQ. And so we've all tried to understand what we think it means for the market. In the interim, we just don't believe it has a negative effect. I clearly think having the beepers and backing up your car and you've got a camera on your car, stops you from bumping into things potentially. But of course, those aren't total loss vehicles. And when I talked to the body shops, they're doing record volume. And that may just be the consolidation of the industry moving more to MSOs. But I just don't see it, Craig. I don't see -- I just don't see a big reduction in vehicles, especially since it's going to take a number of years for those to get into play. And then right now, we're just not seeing that, that stops total loss frequency. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then, how open are you to considering some nonautomotive categories for your services? A. Jayson Adair : Well, I'll give you the cycle time numbers so you have them. And I'll put some color around this so you get it. So in March, our average cycle time was 59 days, and that was a high because of all those Hurricane Sandy cars that came in. By June, we had an average of 59 days. So why didn't it drop off? Well, there's a lot more volume coming in towards the middle of the year as a lot of these consolidations were taking place. And as we sit here today, it's 62 days, so we've got a good 5%, if you will, increase in cycle time, moving from 59 to 62 days today. And that's -- there's no doubt that number is coming off this quarter. And I don't -- really don't want to get into a habit of every call talking about cycle times. The question came up and we responded. Of course, we're running to go get the data to do it on the call. I really don't want to get into cycle times. I just wanted to show you it doesn't move that much. That's why I believe Will said 14% is probably 11%, and that's the math. That's how it works out. So the reality is cycle times don't go from 60 to 90. That doesn't happen. They go from 59 to 62. But we are talking about hundreds of thousands of cars that we have on the ground right now. And when you move something 5%, it's a lot of cars. And every car costs about $1,000. That's how we think about it. We've got revenue associated with the car, all the advances associated with the car, all the costs associated. So when we sell these cars off, we're going to be generating a lot of cash in Q3 and Q4. So I apologize, I wanted to get that out. Craig, what was the question again? Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'm just curious, outside of salvage, how open are you to pursuing growth in some non-salvage automotive categories or even getting outside of automotive altogether in terms of the auction services you provide? A. Jayson Adair : Well, we provide a lot of growth in the automotive non-salvage. Will disclosed that number in his opening remarks, so we'll continue to do that. That's been a big boom for us. And as we've grown over the last 4 years with units, some major suppliers that chose Copart to go 100% with their business, consolidation in the marketplace generally between 2 players, all that has caused growth and yet we've been pretty consistent about maintaining our percentage of non-insurance volumes. So we're going to continue to go down that path. We've got a great team that are working -- that work every day in the growth of that sector. We work already, work non-auto. I was watching an auction yesterday, we were selling a number of 40-foot trailers at one of our locations. So when it comes to large equipment, Crashed Toys that came to us through QCSA, the selling of jet skis and motorcycles and all the fun stuff, the fun vehicles like that or units, that's already a big growth for us. So I don't know if you're specifically asking another question or if you just weren't aware that we were growing in those sectors. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I'm definitely aware of what you're doing, especially on the non-salvage side. I was just curious about thinking more broadly as some of these salvage trends unfold over, let's say, the next decade even. A. Jayson Adair : Yes. I would say, what you're going to ask, where is our focus? Besides all that, that I just mentioned, we are focused right now this year on completing the integration of QCSA and DVAA and Crashed Toys into Copart. We are focused on finishing up -- everybody's moved out of California, not everybody's been -- some of the people didn't move, not everyone's been rehired. So we're finishing up the recruiting process here in the home office. And then we're expanding yards and deploying capital right now to make sure we have volume because there are so many vehicles. We're sitting on damn near 50% more cars than we did 2 years ago. I mean, that's just unbelievable volume to be up that much and that's -- we've got more cars than we did when we had Hurricane Sandy, so like, wow. So we are focused on making sure we've got capacity, service and all those levels up. And then in the next year, the calls will be -- I suspect the calls will be very focused around technology discussions as we are deploying some of those new technology platforms in the next fiscal year. We'll be updating you on how we're doing in that space. Operator : At this time, we have no other questioners in the queue. A. Jayson Adair : All right. Thank you, David. Again, thanks to everyone for coming in the call, and we look forward to reporting on Q3 when we sell off this inventory. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.",

Kennison - Robert W. Baird Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates John R. Lawrence - Stephens John Healy - Northcoast Research Operator :  Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Q3 Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. You may go ahead, sir. A. Jayson Adair :  Thank you, [Chantelle] (ph). Good morning, everyone, and again welcome to the third quarter conference call for fiscal '14. I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Will Franklin, our CFO, who will give you an update on the financial performance for the quarter, and then I'll go through some brief remarks, and then we'll open it up for question-and-answer. Thank you. Will? William E. Franklin:  Thank you, Jay. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the 'Management's Discussion and Analysis' and the 'Risk Factors' contained in our 10-Q, 10-K and other SEC filings. Also during the call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, in particular non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, net income and net income per share. These non-GAAP measures include the impact of Hurricane Sandy and an impairment charge that we announced yesterday. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the press release issued yesterday, which is also available on our Web-site. With that, I'll begin with a few brief comments about the financial results of our third quarter. Total revenue grew by $32.1 million or 11.6%. In the third quarter of last fiscal year, we had additional extraordinary revenue as a result of Hurricane Sandy of approximately $12.7 million. Excluding the Sandy impact, total revenue increased $44.8 million or 16.9%. Purchased car revenue grew by $1 million or approximately 2%. Service revenue increased by $31.1 million. The increase resulted from growth in our international operations which included acquisitions in Germany, Spain, United Arab Emirates, and Brazil of approximately $2.1 million, growth in the U.K. of $9.4 million which was tied to recent market share gains, and growth in North America of $19.6 million. Excluding the Sandy impact, North America services revenue grew by $32.4 million or 17.2%. Total worldwide unit volume increased 11.9%. In North America, total volume increased 11.1%. Excluding the Sandy impact, total North America unit volume grew by 12.2%. In the U.K., volume increased by 21%. In North America, on a same-store sales basis and excluding the impact of Hurricane Sandy, volume grew by over 7% as we are seeing growth in both our market share as well as growth in overall market size, as salvage frequency, we believe, is increasing. In the U.K., our same-store sales volume growth was 21% as all growth came from market wins. In North America, non-insurance car volume grew by over 16% and represented 18% of our total volume. On a year-over-year basis, our North America inventory grew by 19.2%. Excluding the Sandy impact, it grew by 21.9%. In North America, on a same-store sales basis and excluding Sandy, inventory grew by 12.1%. In the U.K., our inventory grew by 16%. Yard operations expenses increased by $17.4 million. The growth was driven by increased volume and an increase in the average cost to process each car. The growth and processing cost were driven by growth in our international activity outside of U.K., as these operations are in their developmental stages and without the benefit of scale, additional cost associated with the QCSA migration and its inefficiencies, and which included lease termination, severance and relocation cost of $800,000, and a general increase in our subhaul employee cost and pass-through cost like vehicle titling cost. The growth in employee cost were led primarily by increased medical insurance cost. We expect to continue to rationalize the existing QCSA cost as we adopt the most efficient plan for processing its volume. We expect lease termination, relocation and severance cost to continue into our fourth quarter. General and administrative cost grew by $7.1 million over the same quarter last year. The increase was due primarily to additional costs tied to our international expansion which totaled $1 million and which will continue, a $1.6 million increase in costs associated with the QCSA acquisition, approximately $600,000 in relocation and severance costs associated with the relocation of our Technology Group from California to Texas, increased non-cash equity compensation of approximately $800,000, and increased expenditures on technology including normal operating cost, maintenance and development. We expect these costs to decline with the recent change in our approach to our international operating system development. Also during the quarter there was a significant reduction in the amount of the developmental cost that we capitalized. We ended the quarter with over $132 million in cash. We expended approximately $11.5 million for capital assets, including the buyout of one lease. During the quarter, we had no open-market share repurchases. We have almost 48 million shares remaining at our current repurchase authorization. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jay Adair for further comments on our third quarter performance. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Will. Again, good morning everyone. Will gave you a pretty extensive update on the growth in revenue for the quarter. I'll talk a little bit about inventory, a little more color on that. And we've tried to explain the growth that's taken place in the last year with Hurricane Sandy as well as some of the costs we've got associated with technology and QCSA. I'm going to go ahead and start with QCSA. Since we've completely integrated that piece of the company, we will have some changes going forward that will be insignificant, we won't be talking about them. So it really is, that piece of the business is integrated. The DVAA is planned for the fourth quarter to be integrated, and there should be some costs that will go into the first quarter of fiscal '15 associated with that. So those two primary businesses are integrated. Our Crashed Toys division is already integrated and new Web-site is out. So, as we begin fiscal '15, that should be completed and done, and all integration is behind us from that standpoint. So, where we're at on standalone side? So we've currently got six Desert View Auto Auctions sites, 149 U.S. sites, 15 U.K. sites, five locations in Canada, one location in the UAE, five locations in Brazil, one location in Germany, and one location in Spain. So we have 183 locations. And we began three years ago a process of building new system as we entered a project we called Overdrive that comes to a close at the end of this fiscal year. The reason we have beginnings and endings to our projects is so that we can rationalize whether or not they make sense, and we believe going into this that building a new system that would allow the integration of our international operations as well as our domestic operations made sense since they are on separate systems. After working on SAP and trying to implement that product, we found that to be very difficult. We found the development cost to be higher than expected, the maintenance cost to be higher than expected, and it has caused our G&A to go up. And so, part of the rationalization of any project that we began and that has a close date is to make a decision on whether or not this is the right thing for the Company. We came to the conclusion that it's not the right thing for the Company, and that at this point we would be going down much simpler path. So, we have international systems that we're going to continue to improve so that we can bring all the international under one system, because they are under multiple systems. We have a rock-solid system that runs the U.S. It's capable of doing everything that our customers want. In fact, it will do a lot of things that they don't ask for. So we have a very rock-solid system there, but the concept was that we would have one instance so that you could go in and take a look at inventory from Brazil to the U.K. to the U.S. We have departed from that and we're going to have multiple instances but we are going to have one data warehouse that we'll be able to go to, to see information and get reporting and that kind of stuff. So, it's a much simpler approach, it's the right approach, and hence, that's the reason for the write-down in the quarter as we decided not to go with SAP as an enterprise-wide system, for all the points that I just mentioned. So, I'm happy to answer any questions on it if there are more questions on it, but it's pretty simple, we went in with our eyes wide open, feeling that this was the right thing to do, and came to the conclusion that for cost and other challenges, that was the wrong thing to do, and so we're course-correcting it this time. Inventory, as Will mentioned, from Q3 '13 to Q3 '14 was up 19%. Excluding QCSA and DVAA it was up 10%, and excluding Sandy it was up 12%. So we've seen a nice increase every single quarter for last four quarters in inventories. That's translated to increased revenues, and at this point I would say that the only thing that we're not happy with right now internally are G&A cost. So we've got increased G&A cost associated with some of what I just talked about with our technology modifications, some of it being associated with one-time costs moving out of California, integrating DVAA, integrating QCSA, et cetera, and that's all going to be rationalized in the next four quarters. So we are very focused on identifying every single asset that we have in our G&A and making sure that it provides value and that we realize the return on that, and if we've got costs that don't belong or that we don't need, then we're going to go through that process of rationalizing that. So, I fully expect that G&A cost \u2013 I can't give you predictions right now, but I fully expect over the next four quarters that we'll see those costs coming down as we go through a process of identifying some existing strategy that needs to be changed or some existing costs that needs to be changed and then that comes out in the future quarters. So, that's where our focus is at. We expect to see good growth in revenues, we've got good growth in inventories, and that's a leading indicator of how we're going to do. As Will stated, we've seen frequency up, we continue to believe that that's going to be the case going forward, and we've got a good plan on how we're going to deal with our technology internationally and we've got great systems both in the U.K. and the U.S. So, we'll continue to run that from an operational standpoint and then implement on our strategy internationally and control costs at the G&A level, and that's really the goals that we've got set right now. So with that, I'm happy to open it up for questions. [Chantelle] (ph)? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from John Lovallo, Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : First question would be just on the SAP system, I mean in your SEC filings it's clearly stated as a risk that if you're not able to implement this new system efficiently and effectively that it could hurt the financial performance. So I guess I understand keeping the same system in place maybe have less cost but are there strategic risks involved to not getting that in place? And then I guess the second part of that would be, is there additional investment that's needed in the current system to kind of bolster the connection with the international operations? A. Jayson Adair : We've got a great domestic system. The purpose then going in for the new system was to implement our international strategy. And then our attitude was, well, if we're going to do this, we're going to go through the work of building a new system, let's make it robust enough so eventually it can replace the U.K. and the U.S. systems. And the way I explain it is, the $29 million write-off is a prime example. You're putting a huge number of resources on something. I don't believe that SAP is the right tool for us on the enterprise system, that was something we went into thinking that it was, and it takes time to do these things to find out and get visibility to realize if it's the right thing or the wrong thing. We've got great systems domestically. In five years, would I like to see those systems integrated worldwide with one instance? Sure I would, and I think that's something we can do, but we can do that in a much more pragmatic approach, module by module, application by application. The systems that we have today are very functional. It was never about replacing them because they don't get the job done. Look at the growth that we've seen in our revenue growth in the last two years, and those systems are very strong, very stable, capable of servicing our clients, everything is good there. That wasn't the intent. The intent was, hey, let's take advantage of new technology that's coming out. Five years ago, iPhones were kind of new. Let's take advantage of new technology where we're doing a lot of the work at the yard with iPhones and iPads and that kind of thing and let's build in a business warehouse, database warehouse where we can get this. So there was a big, big, big scope that at the end of the day I'm convinced that's the wrong approach. The right approach is to go module by module, application by application, improve it, release it, do it in an agile scrum approach so that you always got releases coming out, and not try to do some massive enterprise system interface, and I'm sure you've heard before some of the challenges with companies taking this approach, and we had our reservations about it when we got into this but we thought we were going to be able to do it, and we've been really successful on technology as a company. And so, sometimes that makes you think you can get stuff done that maybe is a little harder to do. And I'm convinced now that the approach that we're on is the right approach. We're going to be cutting back our spend this quarter, has spend in it that would have been capitalized in the past, Will commented on that. So, as we were building this new system, we've got certain expenses that were being capitalized, we're now expensing those through, and we're going to be just taking a much more pragmatic and focused approach to getting the international systems integrated so that they are on one instance, and then eventually bringing that into the U.S. and the U.K. so that those systems are replaced over time. But it's not going to be something we're going to do in a big capital plan project, it's going to be a much more improvement quarter to quarter to quarter, month to month to month, and eventually the systems we got get smaller and smaller until they are replaced. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Thank you. If I could just follow with one quick follow-up here, it was my understanding that in this new ERP system, there was some financial reporting component which was already kind of integrated. So what happens with that now, I mean is there risk to that part of the system? A. Jayson Adair : No, we're going to keep that component of the system. So, we'll be keeping the actual financial reporting tools or replacing the tools that we've got now. So that we are not switching, it's the enterprise system piece that we are not going to go down the path of trying to integrate. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] here on behalf of Ryan. Just wanted to follow up on John's question here. In terms of the ERP implementation, does this change at all your strategic sort of delay in terms of strategic view on the expansion in the international markets in terms of expanding sites, does it push out anything in terms of your strategic expansion plans regarding those markets? A. Jayson Adair : It doesn't really change the strategy in terms of where we want to go and what we want to do but it does slow it down a bit. So we've got another system that we've built, that we'll be improving, and doing one location at a time and integrating it. So, it's going to delay the integration, it will delay some of the international expansion, but it doesn't change the strategy. We're still going to be going after the same markets that we've identified and continuing that growth strategy. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And on the G&A cost front, just was wondering what the underlying rate looks like if once you reach a stable state? And I see that you had called out that ongoing QCSA G&A would be roughly 1.5, and when I look at some clean numbers, it fairly adds up to somewhere close to $30 million as an ongoing basis for G&A costs in a stable state. Is that sort of the way to think about it or are there any more incremental costs to be layered on? William E. Franklin: We think our run rate basis will eventually arrive at a number that's lower than what we have now. It will take a number of quarters to get to that level and to rationalize the cost that are currently embedded in our system, particularly on the technology side. And like Jay said earlier, we can't give guidance on when those costs will leave our system. Unidentified Analyst : And if I could quickly just ask on the vehicle sales revenue change year-over-year, there was $1 million increase, can you just sort of talk about the big puts and takes there, sort of what was the tailwind, what was the headwind, because the growth looked smaller than usual? William E. Franklin: It was, primarily we had a little growth in Europe, but like I said, the change was insignificant, it was $1 million. So we had some growth in Europe, we had a decline in North America as we changed our focus to fewer cars but more profitable cars. So the margin was enhanced, total revenue number was down, but primarily there was no significant change. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Labick, CJS Securities. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Robert Magic] (ph) filling in for Bob. [Indiscernible] in 2013, you had a pickup in RFPs which brought consolidation to the two largest players, yourself and a competitor, are any other more ways of RFPs likely, meaning is there more share to gain from the small players or you'd be holding industry volumes for growth domestically? A. Jayson Adair : I would argue that there's always an RFP that's out there. So that was a unique scenario where there were two very large players that went through a process, that's not happening right now, but there's always business that we are tendering and trying to bring onboard. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Just a follow-up on the ERP issue and just sort of trying to figure out the forward impact on margins, it sounds like you're going to be spending less on an absolute dollar basis but expensing as opposed to capitalizing it, is that how to think about it? A. Jayson Adair : No, that's not entirely correct. You want me to comment or did you want to cover it? William E. Franklin: No, I think there will be an impact on the portion of the total spend that will be capitalized. I think in the short term we're going to capitalize less. I think over the long term, when I say long-term I'm talking about six to eight quarters, that you'll see an overall reduction in our spend on technology and a more measured approach to the rollout of different applications. As Jay said, instead of having a big bang approach to deploying a system that costs tens of millions of dollars, we'll pick one application, for example [assignment] (ph) entry or dispatch, we'll develop that application such that it can accommodate North America requirements, we'll roll that out internationally, and over the course of time we'll have a system that addresses our international operations as well as our domestic operations. At that point, our current system will be sunset. That can take years. But in terms of total spend, it will be at a lower level and a more measured approach. A. Jayson Adair : So less capitalized and less spend. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. And then one question sort of around the core business and inventory growth that's been four quarters of pretty significant expansion, as we saw the quarter progress, did the pace of inventory expansion decelerate out of the winter crash season, and I guess as we look sequentially, is the processing time coming down, is the ability to clear this inventory improving as we've gotten into the early part of fourth quarter? William E. Franklin: The answer to both of those is, yes, marginally. So the pace of growth subsided somewhat this quarter, and on a sequential basis, the processing time also reduced. On a year-over-year basis, it was up nevertheless. When I say year-over-year, I'm talking about the processing time. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : When do you think we're back to sort of a normalized processing time? William E. Franklin: That's hard to predict. It could be several quarters. I think that this increase in volume has to be absorbed by the insurance industry itself in terms of their ability to clear these cars. We've done our calculations and we've tried to estimate, in that 12% same-store inventory growth, we estimate about 4% to 5% of that is due to processing time, which gets us back to an inventory growth excluding that of 7% to 8% which is pretty much in line with our same-store sales growth rate. So we start to triangulate to a number that appears to be playing to about a 7% growth. Operator : Our next question will come from Craig Kennison, Robert W. Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird: I think you mentioned that your plan is to get G&A down. I just want to clarify that that is in dollars or as a percentage of revenue? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, in dollars. William E. Franklin: In absolute terms, dollars. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird: Okay, that's helpful. And given your ability maybe to slow your investments internationally and spend less on key, does that cause you to rethink at all your capital allocation plan? A. Jayson Adair : We review that every Board Meeting. So we're always thinking about it and always looking at our options, Craig. William E. Franklin: Capital allocation consideration is primarily in our business, it's not just in things that we capitalize, it's in almost every dollar that goes out the door. So anyway, I just wanted to make that point as we discussed the allocation of capital. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird: That's fair. I'm getting lots of questions on whether you're going to buy back stock and trying to find a way to ask that question. A. Jayson Adair : So you're not actually asking it? Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird: Exactly. How about an update on the CFO search? William E. Franklin: We're progressing. We have unique needs and we're looking for just the right person with this not only in terms of experience but in terms of personality and culture. Copart has its unique culture and for someone to thrive here, they have to be part of that, and so all I can say is that we're proceeding full speed ahead. Operator : Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : Most questions have been answered but I just want to clarify expenses related to the California shift of employees to Texas, that's basically over, right Jay? A. Jayson Adair : We can have some in our next quarter but primarily it's over, yes. I'd say materially you're correct. William E. Franklin: We've got \u2013 the only expenses that are really left, Gary, are some of the moving package expenses, stuff like that, that has a longer tail on it. So everybody is moved but there is, you've got some hiring that we've got to do, there is some cost associated with bringing new people in, headhunting fees, that kind of thing. You've got some lagging costs associated with moving, but we're almost there. So 2015 is, I'm looking forward to it being our most normalized year, barring another Hurricane Sandy which we don't want. But assuming that we just have weather and hailstorms and the things that are normal that happen across the country, I don't foresee anything that's going to be kind of out there and disallows us to get G&A normalized. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : Right, and that also goes for with QCSA, right, by the beginning of fiscal '15, you'll be where you need to be in terms of the integration? William E. Franklin: That's right. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : It's a clean slate. So really it's just this issue revolving around technology spend, IT spend that you just work on? William E. Franklin: That's right. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : And let me just ask you, I have a simple mind here, why would it take you four quarters to get that rationalized to where you want it to be? If you're stopping developing on this ERP system that you thought you were going to get in place, why would it take so long for that to get rationalized as we go into fiscal '15? A. Jayson Adair : I don't think it will take all four quarters but it will be something that we're working on now and you'll see the effects of that in Q4, Q1, Q2, but it should happen very quickly, but I don't like to say two quarters and it's three. So by saying fiscal '15, that gives us a nice area to work on and get that all taken care of. And some of this stuff that we're doing will take six months to implement. There are some changes that we'll be making that don't happen right away, but nothing there we can see today is more than a year to implement, and that was the reason behind it. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : All right. So again, I don't want to get too much into modeling questions here but I think a lot of people are focusing on what's going to happen when all this is completed in terms of expenses related to all the initiatives that you have, we should kind of expect that as a percentage of sales the expenses, G&A expenses, on a year-over-year basis will be trending down, is that a proper assumption? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. William E. Franklin: Yes, it is. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Armstrong, C.L. King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates: So to clarify, the internally developed system that you're going to use instead of SAP, sounds like some of that's already in place and you just need to roll it out internationally but then there are other modules that are still yet to be developed, is that accurate? A. Jayson Adair : Yes. William E. Franklin: Yes, quite frankly, yes, and in fact that allowed us to make that decision. So we knew that SAP was at least a year and perhaps two years away and we needed to develop something in the interim to allow us to open up some of these international markets. So we embarked on developing that and what we saw as interim solution we liked so much, we thought that we could build upon that and that gave us the leeway to make the decision that we made. A. Jayson Adair : It really boils down to, the system that we use today we have built ourselves, and the system that we are going to use internationally we built ourselves, and when you try to modify a system like SAP, it becomes a time and cost issue and we just weren't willing to stay married to that decision. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates: Okay, I see. And to change topics, could you talk about automotive or vehicle pricing trends at the auctions right now, are we going up, down, kind of holding steady? A. Jayson Adair : Pricing in the third quarter is what we would expect pricing to be in the third quarter. It tends to peak in the second or third quarter and it comes off as you enter in the summer and that's what we've seen. We had I'd say no question of peak in the second quarter and it's been relative to that number, one month it will be up a little, one month down a little bit, but the returns look strong. We talked to our customers and right now returns look good and we're very happy with what we're seeing in terms of percentage of ACV and in whole dollar ASP. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates: Okay, so sounds like we're seeing a normal seasonal pattern. What about on a year-over-year basis, are we higher or lower? A. Jayson Adair : A year ago you were selling Hurricane Sandy cars and they sold for more money. So you really can't compare that. Those were cars that didn't have collision damage and so those are vehicles that are going to bring more money at auctions. So you just can't compare year-over-year with Sandy involved. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates: Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from John Lawrence, Stephens. John R. Lawrence - Stephens: Just real quick, Will, you might've provided a little bit of this in your detail but can you separate for me just a little bit sort of gross margin, if you will, from the North America from the investment overseas and how that's impacting that operating margin domestically versus foreign? William E. Franklin: Sure. I can talk about directionality. I can tell you that North America gross margins are almost as strong as they've ever been, we're very happy with that. Then if you look at U.K. margins, so their EBITDA contribution on a per car basis is what we look at is almost closer to the United States but the margins are much lower, the margins are about 45% lower than that of the United States simply because of the composition of their revenue. They have much more purchased car revenue. So as we grow U.K. revenue as a percentage of our total revenue and as we grow international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue, it has a suppressive impact on our gross margins. And so, it's hard to really analyze our business at the gross margin level because of that, because it is tied so closely to the percentage of our total revenue that comes from purchase activity. So we internally look at EBITDA per car as a metric that we should be focusing on. John R. Lawrence - Stephens: All right. So overall, as you look at the overall model, nothing changes in the base model to get back to where we were say in '12 with that overall operating margin of closer to 31%, 32%? William E. Franklin: No, I can't predict it on an overall basis, I can speak to each segment individually because all are so unique in their characteristics, and like I said, North America had a very strong gross margin quarter. John R. Lawrence - Stephens: Right. And last question, not to beat a dead horse on the system, but can you quantify at all, remove all the starting and stopping, can you give us a pro forma when you looked to make this decision on an annual variable cost from what you're doing to what the SAP was going to cost, can you give us a delta of what those dollars are? William E. Franklin: No, I'm sorry. It would be based on some assumptions I do in my head right now and I just don't want to give that number. John R. Lawrence - Stephens: Great, thanks, good luck. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from John Healy, Northcoast Research. John Healy - Northcoast Research : Jay, I wanted to ask about one of the positive comments you made about the salvage frequency moving higher as a percentage of accidents. Why don't you just give more color on where you think that metric is, what the conversations with your insurance customers have been like recently and where they think that metric can go and maybe some of the cost trends that drive that higher or drive that lower over the next maybe couple of years? A. Jayson Adair : I think the biggest thing right now is vehicle age, you got an aging population of vehicles and that's obviously going to cause more of those vehicles to become total loss then. We're just seeing a lot of weather. I mean it's been a year of significant weather events. We were dealing with a call yesterday on some activity that we've got in the Northeast again. So, I intend that the trend will continue, mainly because of the age of the mix again, because vehicles are getting older. Cost of repair continually goes up. Value of vehicles continue to go gown as they get older and that just means more vehicles are going to be towed, it's just kind of basic math. John Healy - Northcoast Research : Okay. And I wanted to ask, you made a comment about a competitive win in the U.K., is there much going on and changing over there and I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on how the competitive landscape feels in the U.K. and maybe how you're winning some share there? A. Jayson Adair : It's a very competitive market and I would say a market that changes quicker than the U.S. It's obviously a smaller market. The number of players is a much smaller number of players. The players tend to be larger accounts, meaning that the top 10 players in the U.K. control a larger share of the market than the top 10 players in the U.S. So it's a market where it's very quick to change, very progressive in terms of wanting the latest and the greatest products and services that are out there and very competitive. We've got \u2013 now I might be getting on the soapbox by telling you all the great things about us. So I obviously think we've got the best product and the best network of facilities and the lowest pickup times and the highest returns. So we as a team spend a considerable amount of time demonstrating our results both from a quantitative standpoint being objective and showing the numbers, and then also more of interacting with other customers and having them make testimonies on why they like doing business with Copart. So very aggressive, we had a great win, the team made that happen, the team in the U.K. made that happen, they are just on it, they do a wonderful job for the Company and for our customers out there, and I'd love to see that happen again next year, but who knows, that's something we are always shooting for. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Just a follow-up to your comment on a per unit EBITDA and I think you were saying that U.K. all things adjusted are pretty close to the North American productivity, earlier in that prepared remarks you said that the international business, given the lack of scale to date, has been a drag. What's the difference I guess if we look at, or what's the delta between per unit EBITDA in established markets versus the international that you see? William E. Franklin: I'm glad you brought up that comment. So let me clarify it. It's international excluding the U.K. So I mean U.K., like Jay said, they've got a model that's very similar to ours in terms of contribution. But the other countries, Brazil, GCC, Spain, Germany, they are just not there yet, they don't have \u2013 there's so much value to scale that it's hard to quantify and when you're less than 30% of the market, you can't do the things that you can when you exceed that number, and the U.S. and U.K. have done so and you can see the results. The others are in the process of growing their market share, but until they do so, the contributions just aren't close to what they are otherwise. A. Jayson Adair : I'll just add to that a little bit. We have the teams built in the international markets excluding the U.K. that we have in the U.S. and the U.K. So we've got all the support from an analytics standpoint, we've got all the support from a technology IT standpoint, the marketing team, and you can go on and on and on and yet you don't have the vehicle flow going through yet, you don't have the vehicles to offset the cost which you got there. So it's much more front-end loaded with cost, and as the vehicles come in, those will create a market that's more like the U.S. and the U.K. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : I guess just sort of get a feel of what the delta might be, are they half as productive, so the incremental unit takes up margin pretty quickly because you're leveraging the fixed overhead, but what's the starting point, how much less productive is international now? William E. Franklin: I'll just tell you that they're much less than half. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. Operator : Speakers, at this time we have no further questions. A. Jayson Adair : Okay, thank you. Appreciate everybody coming on the call. Thanks for the questions and it was a pleasure for us to be able to give you some flavor on how the quarter came in and how it looks and we look forward to reporting in Q4. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day and you may disconnect.",

Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research John Lawrence - Stephens Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter call for fiscal 2014. Before we get started I am going to turn it over to Will, to do a safe harbor and then he'll go ahead and give you an update on financials. I'll give you an update on the company and then we'll open it up for question. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce Will Franklin? Will Franklin : Thank you, Jay. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the 'Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Risk Factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. With that, I'll begin with some brief comments about our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew by $23.8 million or 9%. Purchased car revenue declined by $9.3 million, which was driven primarily by reduced direct purchase activity in both the U.K. and North America. In addition, there were fewer cars processed for insurance companies on a principle basis in the U.K. Service revenue increased by $27.7 million or 13%. Excluding the residual Sandy sales activity in our fourth quarter of last year, the increase would have been 14.4%. The increase resulted from growth in our international operations, which includes Germany, Spain, United Arab Emirates and Brazil of approximately $1.5 million, growth in the U.K. of $8.7 million, which was tied to market wins and growth in North America of $17.5 million. In North America on a same-store sales basis and excluding the Sandy activity, volume grew by $4.6. In the U.K. our same-store sales unit volume increased 19.3%. All growth came from market wins and growth in the overall market. In North America, non-insurance car volume grew by 5.4% and represented over 20% of the total volume. Yard operation expenses increased $16.2 million. The growth was driven by increased volume and an increase in the average cost to process each car. The growth in processing cost were driven by a general increase in subhaul and employee cost including benefits, increased pass-through cost like vehicle titling cost and cost associated with additional services provided to the sellers. In addition, costs were impacted by increased residual QCSA integration cost and growth in our international activity outside of the U.K., as these operations are in their developmental stages without the benefit of scale. General and administrative cost remain relatively consistent with the same quarter last year. We expect to see a reduction in our quarterly G&A expenses on an absolute basis by the end of this fiscal year, as we rationalize cost associated with our prior technology strategy. We ended the quarter with over $158 million in cash. We generated $55 million and $263 million in operational cash flow during the quarter and the fiscal year respectively. During the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $18.2 million, primarily for yard expansion technology and equipment. Finally during the quarter, we had no open market share repurchases. We've almost $48 million share -- 48 million shares remaining in our current repurchase authorization. That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Jay Adair, our CEO for further comments on the quarter. Jay? Jay Adair : Thank you, Will. And just so everyone is aware Will and I are in different locations today. So when we get to the Q&A section, if you can specify who you want to answer the question that would be great. So we started the year with the acquisition of QCSA and Desert View Auto Auctions and Crashed Toys \u2013right in the fourth quarter. So fiscal 2014, a big part of the year was integrating those three companies into Copart and I am happy to report that at the end of the fiscal year we have done that. QCSA was fully integrated into the Copart locations, Copart systems, technologies and culture, at this point; DVAA, the Desert View Auto Auctions, we've integrated on to our systems, but it is a standalone business with its own locations and it is run by Joe Mulcahy and he is, and his team, really are the head of the Cherry division for Copart. So their focus is to really think about how to differentiate us from a cherry perspective handling those types of cars. On the QCSA side, the team that was part of that company is now part of Copart and we've taken a number of things that they did to differentiate themselves from both Copart and our competitor in the marketplace and implemented those inside of Copart. So a lot of their best-in-class practices are now have become policy at Copart and have become differentiators for us going forward and we've got that team now in the leadership roles within Copart and helping us to grow the business. So that's all real exciting stuff that occurred in the year. That growth plus new volume really is the driver on the 9% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and Will gave you some of the numbers, so there is no sense in really repeating that. What I would specify is that you see an increase in G&A cost and G&A literally for Q4 of '13 to Q4 of '14 are relatively flat, but they were high throughout the year. So there is a focus going into fiscal '15 to work on operating cost, both in the field and to work on yard and fleet -- I am sorry, work on G&A at the home office to reduce those costs. So there are some yard and fleet expenses as Will just discussed that are not going to be coming down, but there is other expenses that we think we can achieve some additional efficiencies on. So there will be focus there. We're really not in a position to give estimates on what that's going to be because it's something we're all working internally on seeing if we can find additional efficiencies in the field. At the home office, same sort of story. We clearly know there are some areas where we can cut some cost. So we're working on that. If you look at the last three years, there is the move out of California, there is the technology approach and a number of these things added one-time cost for the company and we really don't want to get into a position of trying to call out every single quarter. The point is this. 2015 this fiscal year will be the last year where we see any kind of non-recurring one-time expenses both in the field and the G&A. Additionally, we announced in the last quarter that we had -- that we had changed our strategy on our technology and net income and EPS for fiscal '14 were substantially and adversely affected by $29 million in capitalized software development. An impairment that we took in the third quarter of 2014 and particularly the impairment reduced EPS by $0.15 and I mentioned this on our last call that the impairment related to our discussion not -- our decision rather not to proceed with replacing our legacy enterprise software system with a new SAP-based system and our Form 10-K will also be disclosing pending litigation we initiated against Sparta Consulting related to this impairment. So let me give you a little color. We hired Sparta Consulting, which I believe is now called KPIT to implement the new SAP system and KPIT had originally agreed to deliver the complete SAP-based replacement for our enterprise system with a targeted final deployment of March 01, 2013. By September of 2013, the project was not close to completion and over the life of the project, KPIT failed to meet key contractual milestones and the coding consistently failed user acceptance testing. As a result, we determined that KPIT had not delivered and could not deliver under its contract with Copart and we terminated with KPIT. We also concluded that most of KPIT's work was of no value to Copart and that the most appropriate and cost effective option was to scrap the project. As a result of this decision, we were required under applicable accounting rules to take a $29 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. We are also currently in litigation with KPIT over its deficient performance under the contract and related misconduct. The litigation is now pending in Federal Court in California and Copart intends to fully pursue its remedies regarding KPIT's failure to provide the SAP-based system required under the contract and we will update you concerning developments in the case as appropriate in our future SEC filings. So this is not something that we plan on discussing much more going forward, but we want to make you aware of this. It goes in line with what we discussed before that the SAP system, when we took it over and got more involved in looking at trying to have that as the replacement for our existing operating systems that it was just not -- it was not going to work. There were a lot of reasons why we didn't feel that it was the right strategy for Copart. So that is -- that's where we are at on that. We are currently working on modifying our existing systems such that they will work internationally. The systems are great domestically. They are integrating those systems today with SAP Financials because we are removing or replacing the JD Edwards systems with SAP and all that felt good. We're happy with every part of that. There is nothing that I can say that isn\u2019t going the way we thought it was going to go, but we went into this thinking that we could replace our systems with an SAP product and the cost and the delay and the failure in a number of areas there just made it the wrong strategy. So we got new system that we're working on integrating with our existing systems and that will allow us to go international. So there is going to be some delay until we get that done. Okay. Let's talk about marketing update for a bit. So we launched our mobile product in fiscal '13 and fiscal '13, 8% of total auction attendance was through mobile. That number by the end of fiscal '14 jumped to 23%. So 23% of all auction attendance now is being done on our mobile app and those that use the app daily represent 85% of our customers. So it is obviously a product that's been embraced by our customers and again we go back to the days of live auction and you had to get physically to the location. Along came the Internet and yet now you got to have a laptop [in] (ph). So with your -- with the mobile app literally, you open your phone from anywhere with a signal and you get access to our auction. So, it really is about as friction free now, as it can get. In 2014, we saw a 248% increase in inventory searches related to mobile. So, they\u2019re not just attending auctions. They\u2019re doing searches. And then we saw a 122% increase in the number of new registrations, members actually coming on through mobile and accessing the system. So, that\u2019s good news on the mobile front. Crashedtoys.com went live in the fiscal year as well. And, we\u2019ve got that specialty division that we brought into the Copart family a year ago and we\u2019re heavily focused now on differentiating on all toy type product, everything from motorcycles and boats to exotic vehicle. So that is all live and you can check it out at crashedtoys.com. And finally, I would just -- got a couple comments here. In July, we saw member registration topping over a 1,000 per month, just for Crashed Toys alone. And, if we compare July '13 versus July '14, we saw a 29% increase in total new member registration across the Copart family, across the Copart Company. So, real big increase this year in the number of new members coming into the site and getting those converted. We really view our marketing team as a differentiator in this space. It\u2019s about finding customers that want to buy the product we\u2019re selling and then it\u2019s about, once you\u2019ve got those members, making sure that they can find the product that we\u2019ve got for sale. So, having all the right filters and all the different ways that you can look for product is critical; so, again, big, big differentiator. And then the final point I would make is that a third of all new members that came to Copart were referred to Copart from people that already know about the company, which is good news. It\u2019s nice that the number is that large. On the flip side of that, it was two thirds of the new members that we signed up in the year didn\u2019t know who we were. So, again that push to get more and more and more customers out there to become aware of us is front and centre with respect to our focus. All right, Will has talked about the cash numbers and he talked about the debt. And, so, I am not going to repeat all that. So with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Tiffany? Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you. Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. (Operator Instructions) Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Will Franklin : Hi Bob. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi. So, Jay, I know you just said, you don\u2019t want to get into the weeds in terms of some of the expenses and helping us down there in terms of like $500,000 relocation this or that. But, I was hoping you could take a step back and just give us a sense on the gross margin on the service side even from a macro basis. Over the course of the year, you had QCSA and you\u2019ve been pulling out cost, but consistently it\u2019s been higher than we\u2019ve modeled. I am just trying to get a good sense of, where the operating leverage lies on a go-forward basis? And I know, blending it international makes it harder, but if you could take a step back and just talk about operating leverage on a go-forward basis as we see sales growth? Jay Adair : Yeah, sure, I would just throw out there to you Bob that it\u2019s not going to be back at the same operating margin that it was prior and that\u2019s not just the QCSA or it\u2019s not a QCSA thing. It\u2019s just that the market that we\u2019re in, we\u2019ve just got increased cost, labor costs are up, fuel costs are up. So there is a number of costs that are up across the board. But then some of it is the integration and putting the two companies together. So, we anticipate it\u2019s going to come down and I appreciate your comments. It\u2019s just -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise. Will and I discussed it this morning and we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to try and lay out every single expense that we\u2019ve got. So, we anticipate that next year, we\u2019re going to get the operating margin. By the end of fiscal '15, we\u2019re going to get our operating margin to as good as we can get it and it\u2019s not going to take more than four quarters to do that. And, we\u2019re going to get our G&A where it needs to be, and then, that\u2019ll be it. I don\u2019t see on the horizon another large acquisition to put with the company domestically and so, it\u2019s going to take us about a year to get those transitions completed and trying to single out the actual expenses is just really tough to do. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, no, fair enough. And then, looking ahead at the U.S. side, obviously, you\u2019ve had some great wins in RFPs in the last couple of years, last year and some national account wins. What are the -- you share is pretty high. What are the drivers for domestic growth going forward from here? Jay Adair : Well, it\u2019s still the push, non-insurance. The insurance market, I would call it mature at this point. We\u2019re -- we and our competitor are handling the majority of the volume domestically and the real growth is to push for non-insurance volume. The other driver I would say is, just the overall market increasing. The market really got slowed down and back in '08, '09. And so there\u2019s -- I would say, fundamentally off the top of my head two drivers. One is, ASP is going up and we may see ASPs increase in the future because I think they\u2019re -- while they\u2019re at a record high, I think they\u2019re lower because we\u2019ve got an ageing fleet and there weren\u2019t as many new cars. And, so as they start to sell more new cars again, I think that\u2019s going to -- I know that\u2019s going to increase the quality of vehicle we sell and the ASPs will go up. The other driver is because we haven\u2019t sold so many vehicles new, we\u2019ve got an ageing fleet and we\u2019re seeing unit volumes increase. So, we will see from the day that we've looked at an increase in the number of units in the next year, two year, three year out; as vehicles get older, they just become that more likely to total. So those are the drivers on the insurance side and then on the growth for Copart is non-insurance volume, which is about 20% of our company today and we want to obviously make that number larger. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Jay Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : This is Liz Suzuki on for John. A question on acquisitions. Are there any particular geographic markets that Copart is particularly focused on? Jay Adair : Domestically or internationally? Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Either. Jay Adair : Yeah. So, you\u2019re right. I would say, internationally what we\u2019re trying to do right now is finish some integration work that\u2019s got to be done with systems and then, we\u2019ll be looking at expanding into markets that we think fit our mould, where we think it will be easiest to implement our model or easiest to make acquisitions in those markets. And then, domestically, as I said, the market is pretty \u2013 it\u2019s pretty mature at this point. So, I don\u2019t think there is a lot of core business acquisitions in the salvage arena domestically. I just don\u2019t see it as we sit here today. Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So, most of the opportunity is international, then. And, just a quick one on -- regarding the tax rate, 30.9% it was pretty low in the quarter. What was the cause of that and should we expect it to return to closer to 35% going forward? Will Franklin : No, it shouldn\u2019t return to 35%. It was a unique quarter and as much as we had some discrete tax adjustments that reduced our rate. But no, it would be, I would say just a little north of 34%, I would expect that. Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Will Franklin : And as International becomes a more meaningful side, part of our activity I would expect that to decline. Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan: Hi, this is Samik here on behalf of Ryan. Just wanted to get an update on the inventories first, I didn\u2019t really hear anything in terms of inventories, how much were they up year-over-year on a same-store basis in North America, can you just help us with that? Will Franklin : Sure. Inventory is up little over 5% on a same-store basis. Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. So, is there any -- just on the trends on processing times and tax contributing to any of the higher inventory you\u2019re seeing? Also, what trends did you see in processing times? Sequentially I think last quarter you mentioned that processing times were coming down, is that still looks to be the trend? Will Franklin : The insurance companies are addressing that and so some insurance companies are doing a better job than others. In general, the days inventory are starting to subside. Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. And my next question is primarily around international expansion and your strategy there. When we look in terms of the expenses that you\u2019ve been incurring or the investments that you\u2019ve been doing that\u2019s been a headwind on margins, but when we think about the trajectory of your investments, which sort of phase are you in? And do you think these expenses or investments will accelerate for the next year as you continue to build scale in those markets? Or are they going to normalize and what is probably your updated outlook on being profitable in these international markets obviously outside U.K.? Jay Adair :  Yes, so I'll comment. We didn\u2019t - I didn\u2019t hear you specified it. I guess from the perspective of profitability in international markets, that\u2019s always hard to predict. I would say we\u2019re going to have some technology completed in the next year and that\u2019s going to allow us to reduce some cost because it just makes us that much more efficient. From a G&A perspective, we have said -- we said on this call and I'll say it again, we don\u2019t anticipate G&A going up in the next year. We anticipate it coming down. That\u2019s fully loaded G&A, that\u2019s just not domestic, that\u2019s international, that\u2019s everything. So we\u2019ve got teams in place. We've expense in place and at this point, we don\u2019t anticipate cost going up at a G&A level. We anticipate revenue going up. Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Jay Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets :  Hi, good morning. Jay Adair : Good morning, Bret. Will Franklin :  Good morning. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : A quick question on yard operating expenses. Is there -- something structurally changed in that pass-through in some of the services that you\u2019re spending on? Are they related to the RFP businesses that you got more labor and/or expense built into some of these insurance contracts? Will Franklin : Yes, part of it. Part of this we\u2019re just providing more services to the sellers and that\u2019s a part of the RFP process. A part of it is a structural change in our cost, our sub-hauling cost have increased with the increase in volume, we have diminished ability to utilize the low cost providers. We had to expand the sub-haulers that were used, but by so doing, we had to utilize those that charge a higher rate. And we have a natural increase in our labor cost and our benefits cost. And all those have had a permanent structural change in our yard operating cost on a per vehicle basis. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then a qualitative question. I think earlier you began to address your inventory bulge and some of the cycle times that we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, but it sounds like inventory is beginning to work down. Could you give us a feeling where we are relative to a normal base level in the inventory work down? Are we 20% of the way to where you would expect us to be in a base case scenario or 50% or sort of a general ballpark? Will Franklin : It\u2019s hard to predict, but currently our same-store inventory levels are about 5%. Our same-store sales are about 5%. So, it seems to suggest that\u2019s about the new norm of 5% growth. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Will Franklin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator :  Thank you, Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research :  Good morning, guys. Jay Adair : Good morning. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : On insurance side, can you -- it's 20% non-insurance, could you maybe find a bucket there between dealer-consumer and are you considering charity in that non-insurance as well? Jay Adair : Yes. Charity is included in non-insurance. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : So, what I'm trying to get at is, if you could bucket how that 20% split goes between those three areas and those markets if you would and give us a thumbnail look at how each of those particularly the deal are more interested and what's the growth profile has looked like here this year? Jay Adair : So, we've had growth in both dealer cars and charity cars and we\u2019ve had a slight decline in what we call our core cars. Those are cars that came from individuals and companies that just the living, buying and selling cars on our platform. Those are the three major buckets. In addition of that we have other institutional sellers, banks for the repositions fleets like Southwest Bell and AT&T that utilize us for fleets, rental companies that utilize us as well. But primarily most of our volumes comes from those three buckets; charities, franchise independent dealerships and individual car brokers. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : All right. And is charity still the largest of all of those three followed by maybe fleet and then dealer? Jay Adair : I would say charity. Will Franklin : Go ahead Jay. Jay Adair : I was just going to say no. Dealer is clearly the largest. It\u2019s bigger than the charity side. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay, so they are largest. And you\u2019re saying obviously the focus is on that -- that non-insurance segment for growth. Are you devoting much more marketing efforts, selling efforts there? Have you increased your feet on the street to get more business there? Jay Adair : There's been some increase. We\u2019ve made some changes in the last year and so we\u2019ve got some -- we've got -- I guess you called some cost creep that\u2019s come in through some of those efforts, but I look at that as an investment. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do to drive that book of business. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. And then you also mentioned that you've adopted some best-in-class practices from QCSA. Could you maybe elaborate on what\u2026 Jay Adair : Well there -- I'm hesitant to, Gary because they\u2019re differentiators in the space and we\u2019ve done some things with clients that -- our clients like those kinds of differentiators as well. And so some of it is -- some simple stuff that\u2019s technology based. Some web changes things like that, but some of its process driven and it\u2019s definitely something that we use with clients to give them a better experience than what they'll get elsewhere. So, it\u2019s proprietary stuff. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. That\u2019s fair. All right. And then lastly not looking for any actual numbers, but as we go through the year, should we sequentially see declines in G&A expenses as you do this, finish off what you need to do to get the in line? Jay Adair : No, I don't think that we're prepared to make that assertion. I think our comment stands that by the end of the year, we\u2019ll see a decline. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. Jay Adair : There is a lot of work that needs to take place pretty now and then. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. Thank you. Jay Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Will Franklin :  Thank you, Gary. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from John Lawrence with Stephens Inc. John Lawrence - Stephens Inc.:  Good morning, guys. Jay Adair : Good morning, John. John Lawrence - Stephens Inc.: I understand the reluctance to give any guidance as far as those margins are concerned. But Will, can you look at it another way and just say the pressure is on the business, obviously on the yard cost and as far as that operating metrics and then all said that with G&A and then just put in perspective, I guess couple of years ago, we were at a -- and were closer to a 32% operating margin. We\u2019ve lost -- there's 500 basis points of erosion. Is there a certain amount of that 100 and 150 basis points that you could point to that you can't recover or can you give any comment -- I'm not talking about timeframe, but just what would be the limiting abilities to get back -- can you offset SG&A with some of those operating cost? Will Franklin : So, it\u2019s hard to look at our business on a margin percentage basis or an EBIT percentage basis. Because of the impact that purchase car revenue has on that and as that fluctuates, that has a tremendous impact on that percentage. So, we look at our business on an EBIT per car basis. John Lawrence - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Will Franklin : And when you look out on that basis, we\u2019re fairly happy with where we were this year. We were surely not where we were in 2012, but we\u2019re where we were in 2011. So, we anticipate to increase that next year as we go through the rationalization of certain cost, but it\u2019s hard for me to talk about it on a percentage basis. John Lawrence - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Will Franklin : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. And it looks like we have no further questions at this time. Jay Adair : All right. Well, thank you again everyone for attending the fiscal '14 fourth quarter call for Copart, and we look forward to giving you updates on the next quarter and this concludes our call. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

L. King & Associates Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc. David Karnofsky \u2013 JP Morgan Operator :  Welcome to the Copart incorporated first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Just as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. A. Jayson Adair : Welcome to the first quarter call for fiscal 2015. I\u2019m going to pass it over to Will Franklin who will give you an update on the financials and then he\u2019ll pass it back to me for some quick remarks and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Will Franklin. William E. Franklin : Before we begin our comments, I\u2019d like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10K, 10Q and other SEC filings.  With that I\u2019ll begin with a few brief comments about our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew by $10.5 million or 3.8%. Purchase car revenue declined by $9.7 million driven by a reduction in both volume and in revenue per car. The reduction in volume resulted from lower direct purchase activity in both the UK and North America as well as fewer cars processed for insurance companies on a principle basis in the UK.  Service revenue increased by $20.2 million or 8.9%. The increase resulted from growth in our international operations which included Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and Brazil of approximately $1.7 million, growth in the UK of $6.2 million, and growth in North America of $12.3 million. Growth in North America and the UK was driven by both an increase in volume and an increase in revenue per car.  Purchased car volume represented 6% of total volume in the current quarter versus 7.3% in the same quarter last year. Overall volume grew by almost 4% while inventory grew by over 9%. In North America non-insurance car volume grew by almost 2% and represented almost 21% of the total volume sold.  Yard operation expenses increased by $6.3 million. The growth was driven by the increased volume as we saw a drop in average cost to process each car, reflecting our efforts to eliminate operational inefficiencies. General and administrative costs declined by approximately $1.4 million as the same quarter last year contained $2.9 million in severance, lease termination and relocation costs associated with our QCSA acquisition and the move of our technology team from California to Texas. We expect to see a reduction in our quarterly G&A expenses on an absolute basis by the end of this fiscal year as we rationalize costs associated with our prior technology strategy.  Finally, during the quarter we generated over $83 million in operational cash flow and we expanded $23.4 million for yard expansion, technology, equipment, and three lease buyouts. That concludes my brief comments, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our CEO Jay Adair. A. Jayson Adair : As we said in the beginning, we\u2019re going to be pretty brief with the comments. We spoke last year about the rationalizing of cost in fiscal \u201915. We\u2019re starting to see that in the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to see that in the second, third, and fourth quarter of the year. As previously stated we expect that rationalizing of cost to be completed at the end of fiscal \u201915. There are a number of costs in last year that were associated with the integration of QCSA, CrashedToys, DVAA, and a number of one-time costs that existed in the prior year that will not exist in the current year.  In addition to that, Will spoke to the technology strategy that we had previously. We are now going through a process of eliminating all inefficiencies that exist from our prior strategy and seeing some improvements there as well at the G&A level. So, you\u2019re going to see improvements in the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter both in G&A costs and you\u2019re going to see improvements in operational costs.  We are focused right now on seeing total dollars reduced but also percentage of G&A as a whole as we continue to see increases in sales. So we\u2019ll be focused on the cost side and then we\u2019re going to see increased sales as well due to increased inventory. So as will talked about, there\u2019s some timing that exists currently with respect to sales that occurred in the quarter and then the inventory build that took place again in the quarter. We have seen a consistent build in inventory for the last three years, year after year, after year increase and we expect that inventory to be sold off in the year that we\u2019re in now. Looking at the current month of November, volume is up year-over-year and in terms of assignments and that\u2019s going to manifest into sales again in the quarter and so we wanted to give you a little color on that. Then, with respect to inventories, as we talked about, we should be building those again in the second quarter. We expect, as we\u2019ve seen in the past as we build inventory first and second quarter due to seasonality of business and then sell those vehicles off in third and fourth quarter, but we\u2019ve also seen some inventory builds due to timing in the past. We expect that that\u2019ll continue to be the case and that we\u2019ll see some of those inventories sold off in the existing quarter we\u2019re in, the timing component and then the inventory build that\u2019s seasonality driven we should be selling off in the third quarter. Overall, we\u2019re really happy with the quarter. We\u2019re excited about how the improvements in costs have already started taking place in the quarter we\u2019re in. We look forward to seeing further success in those areas as we go into the rest of the year. With that, I\u2019m just going to turn it over for questions and go with that. Thank you. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Labick \u2013 CJ Securities. Bob Labick :  Just back to Jay\u2019s last comments on inventory there, you said it grew 9% I guess in the quarter and your sales were up 9%. Last quarter inventory was only up 5%, was there new business wins or other drivers? Jay you alluded to timing but could you just clarify what that refers to as opposed to seasonality? A. Jayson Adair : We\u2019ve had some wins in the past year that candidly, some of the accounts don\u2019t move their cars as quickly as our normal book of business, if you took the average for how fast vehicles move. We had some insurance company wins that don\u2019t move their vehicles as quickly so we got some inventory deals in the last year that we\u2019re now starting to see sell off and we think that\u2019s going to happen in the next quarter.  The seasonality piece is that you don\u2019t have \u2013 regardless of the mix of business inventories are going to build in the quarter we\u2019re in now November, December, and January and then we\u2019re going to be selling of that inventory February, March, and April. Typically the peak happens sometime in February and then there\u2019s a big sell off of inventory March, April, and May. That\u2019s all I was referring to, there\u2019s a timing component and we\u2019ve just seen inventory continue to build. It built last quarter, it built this quarter, and you\u2019d normally expect in the fourth quarter to see some of that inventory dropping off but it just seems like we keep building and building inventory. Bob Labick : Then you\u2019ve been very successful in continuing to increase your non-insurance cars as well, because you\u2019ve had a lot of insurance wins. Can you talk about the levers that you\u2019re pulling and your thoughts on non-insurance car growth and what you\u2019re pursuing on a go forward basis? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on it. It\u2019s been a big growth driver for us over the last five years and I don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019ll change. We\u2019re going to continue to push for that book of business to grow. The fact that it\u2019s been able to maintain while we\u2019ve grown market \u2013 there\u2019s two things that have happened on the insurance side, big market share gains for Copart and then the second thing is it\u2019s the 80% of the pie that grows and so obviously if the two grew at the same rate, you\u2019d expect the non-insurance to fall behind because it\u2019s a fifth of the size and yet it\u2019s been able to maintain basically that one fifth push. We see a big trend right now in older vehicles. We talked about that six years ago when we saw new car sales fall off in \u201908 and that older mix allows vehicles to total easier and so we\u2019re seeing unit volumes up every single quarter and yet we\u2019ve been able to maintain that 80/20 mix on the non-insurance side and so we\u2019ll keep pushing in that area. Bob Labick : On cost to process car, you saw nice leverage this quarter but it\u2019s been a couple of quarters in a row where you had faster cost to process a car than revenue per car. What changed in the quarter and do you think you\u2019ve kind of turned the corner in terms of getting back to that yard leverage? A. Jayson Adair : We had a lot of costs that were associated with \u2013 it\u2019s hard to define for everyone how much costs we have associated with an integration like Quad Cities and integrating a business like that has a number of costs that have to be taken in in that year we did the integration and now we\u2019re going to see that number coming down. The other side is we\u2019re very focused on making sure we have the optimal expense per car. So, there\u2019s two pushes, one is that we\u2019re rationalizing expenses and the other side is that we\u2019ve got a year now where we don\u2019t have those expenses baked into the model and so both of those are going to drive our cost per car down. That\u2019s our goal for the year. Operator :  Your next question comes from John Lovallo \u2013 Merrill Lynch. John Lovallo : Two quick questions for you Will and then one strategic question for Jay. Will, first on the purchased vehicle revenue and your strategy there for purchased vehicles, it seems like you\u2019re focusing on fewer more profitable vehicles which has been working pretty well. Is this a strategy that you guys expect to maintain and if so do you think this kind of mid $40 million quarterly run rate is reasonable? William E. Franklin : Well, you\u2019re absolutely right with respect to our strategy, we\u2019re focused on more profitable cars and the contribution on a per car basis is higher on a purchased car than it is a fee car. But, we can\u2019t predict what the revenue will look like several quarters out. We can tell you what we\u2019re focusing on in terms of our strategy and basically it\u2019s that, look for the more profitable cars if it\u2019s marginal in nature. If there\u2019s any risk of loss at all we don\u2019t pursue it. John Lovallo : Then the step down in general and administrative, depreciation and amortization in the quarter, is that largely due to the write down from the technology system, the SAP system? William E. Franklin : Well, not that system specifically but that in general we\u2019re very aggressive in writing off our technology and our capitalized development cost and so we put a short life span on it so it caused some fluctuations in our D&A as that technology reaches end of life and that\u2019s exactly what happened this quarter. We had a lot of technology that reached its end of life. John Lovallo : Then Jay, one strategic question for you, as you guys push more into the non-insurance business, do you get the sense that customers would prefer having another kind of big player in the market for one? Then do you see the fact that you guys don\u2019t have a physical auction presence as a potential road block? As the vehicles get higher in price do you sense that customers want to be able to get into the physical auction and kick the tires or is that not the case? A. Jayson Adair : Well, I\u2019ll answer the last question first. We do have a physical auction presence. We\u2019ve got over 6,000 acres around the country, over 150 sites that we\u2019re storing cars and the buyers today do come out and look at the vehicles, and can come out any time they want and look at the vehicles. They don\u2019t have to be standing there during the auction, though they can. During the auction they can stand there in the lane and big on their iPhone, but the nice thing about our model is they don\u2019t have to. They can do all the preinspection of the vehicle prior to the auction and they can be sitting at a Starbucks coffee shop and bidding.  That\u2019s really the magic of our product is we stripped out all the inefficiencies and the friction coming to the auction. But the physical facilities are there so they have the ability to completely inspect the vehicle, look it over and be 100% comfortable with their purchase. Your first question, I\u2019m not sure I fully understood what you were driving at. John Lovallo : Manheim and ADESA are pretty big in the kind of whole car side of the business, do you get the sense that the market could support a third kind of sizeable player? A. Jayson Adair : We\u2019re not interested in doing that. We\u2019re not going after their book of business typically. We go after dealer business that is in many ways neglected in the industry, but we\u2019re not trying to go in and compete directly in the same space that they are. We\u2019re much more trying to serve a market that we think is underserved. Operator :  Your next question comes from Bret Jordan \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan : If we\u2019re looking at the inventory and I guess as we\u2019ve seen some extended cycle times with some of your insurance customers have those cycle times improved or are we just sort of normalizing inventory levels around these new customers? I guess as we think about working inventory down, is it a more efficient processing system or are we just going to anniversary what is a slower turn customer and we\u2019ll work down from there? William E. Franklin : In general, the days inventory is improving, is declining, but there are some customers that still \u2013 some suppliers that have an opposite trend and we\u2019re working with those suppliers to help them improve their processes. One of the most idle assets we have is our land and to consume it with old inventory is not in our best interest nor in their so we work with them to try to make those processes as efficient as possible. Bret Jordan : Is there a way we can look at North America insurance inventory and carve out the non-insurance business and the non-US business and sort of look on a quarterly basis to measure the efficiency of that turn or is that a number you\u2019d care to share? A. Jayson Adair : Will is looking but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too important. At the end of the day their incentivized to move that inventory. The vehicle is going to depreciate that sits in the yard next to 30 days so it\u2019s to their advantage to move the vehicle and we\u2019re working \u2013 it\u2019s one of the services we provide, is to move that vehicle. We\u2019ve seen that number coming down now so we believe that the peak in terms of inventory due to cycle time, we\u2019ve reached that. Now we\u2019re going to see inventories build so I don\u2019t want you to think the opposite, we\u2019re going to see inventories build but that\u2019s due to seasonality now as we enter the second and third quarter. But we think we\u2019re past that, we think that\u2019s over Bret so we think at this point that inventory is going to be coming down in the future. Bret Jordan : One last question around that of same theme. I guess the average unit selling price as vehicle values are coming in a little bit and maybe inventory has built up, what\u2019s been the trend there? Where are we in maybe deflation on the units? William E. Franklin : Well actually, on a year-over-year basis our ASPs are higher. Bret Jordan : But are you expecting that we\u2019re going to see any deflation because used vehicle values are declining and you sort of build that into your expectations or is the quality of the vehicle going up where it offsets? William E. Franklin : No, I would say that there\u2019s been a very tight correlation between ASPs and used vehicle pricing. I expect that to continue. A. Jayson Adair : Used vehicle pricing comes down and then that means the ACV, the actual cash value that an insurance company pays for cars comes down. As that happens you\u2019ll see sale price come down but you\u2019ll see volumes go up. Operator :  Your next question comes from Bill Armstrong \u2013 C. L. King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Will, in your opening remarks you did cite higher revenue per car so is that a pricing issue or are there other drivers behind that? William E. Franklin : Primarily it\u2019s other drivers. It\u2019s a higher ASP on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s also mix. We generally have more revenue per car on non-insurance cars. Bill Armstrong : The Manhiem is slightly lower than it was a year ago, so I would have expected your ASP all other things being equal to be down maybe 1% but not the case apparently? William E. Franklin : No, like I said we have different contracts and we have different supplier types. We have banks, repossessions, we have charities, we have title loans, all those have a different type of revenue profile so the mix has an impact on our revenue per car. Operator :  Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Will, you said your volumes processed were up 4% in the quarter, is that correct? William E. Franklin : That is correct. Gary Prestopino : That is also a same store number because we\u2019ve anniversaried all the acquisitions? William E. Franklin : We have one small acquisition in Canada but the numbers are virtually the same. Gary Prestopino : Can you break it down between North America and UK? William E. Franklin : The UK had a higher volume growth than the US. I don\u2019t have the exact percentage in front of me. Gary Prestopino : Then a couple of other questions here. I just want to dig into the vehicle sales versus service revenues. On the vehicle sales side I was kind of writing as I was listening, was there any material shift and a change in programs for some of the purchased cars going to fee based cars for what you\u2019re doing for insurers in UK this quarter or was this just a function of ebb and flow of purchased vehicles coming to market? William E. Franklin : No, there\u2019s been no change in the program. In a response to a question earlier, there\u2019s been a change in focus internally so we\u2019re not pursuing the cars that are only marginally profitable or cars that there\u2019s any risk in a loss. So while the volume is coming down the revenue and the contribution per car is going up. Gary Prestopino : So you\u2019re not pursuing the cars on the insurance side or the public dealer side? My understanding of it is with the insurance companies you can sometimes get hit with adverse selection because they\u2019re giving you a whole bunch of cars in bulk, or am I wrong there? William E. Franklin : What I was referring to in being more selective it was in respect to our direct purchase programs. We don\u2019t have that option with the insurance companies. We haven\u2019t seen any wild fluctuation in the contribution from the insurance cars in the UK. Gary Prestopino : A couple of more questions here. Towing, obviously with the price of fuel coming down are the towers still hitting you with fuel surcharges and do you expect the price of your tows to start coming down given that fuels cascading downward here. William E. Franklin : We\u2019re very aggressively managing our subhaul fleet and yes, we\u2019re pointing out the fact that two things are in our favor, the average tow zones is coming down and the cost of fuel is coming down and we\u2019re managing that to control our subhaul cost on a per car basis. Gary Prestopino : Tell us what percentage of it would \u2013 it would be in yard operations is that towing expense? William E. Franklin : It is. Gary Prestopino : What is the percentage that is towing within yard expense? A. Jayson Adair : We don\u2019t break that out Gary. Gary Prestopino : Lastly, on the balance sheet there\u2019s a big movement on something called accumulated comprehensive loss from $20 million to almost $44 million. Can you tell us what that is? William E. Franklin : Sure. With the [striking] of the dollar, the value of the foreign assets is reduced and the way that\u2019s accounted for as we consolidate those foreign assets is to recognize that reduction and their relative value through the equity section. Operator :  Your next question comes from Craig Kennison \u2013 Robert W. Baird. Craig Kennison : I wanted to understand better the impact of used price volatility if you will. Could you remember us what percentage of your business is on straight commission versus the PIP program you have? William E. Franklin : The percentage of contracts on the PIP program has gone down significantly but I\u2019ll tell you over the course of the last five years the difference in the contribution between the contracts has almost disappeared so we really stopped quoting that number a few years ago. Craig Kennison : So is the model less sensitive to volatility in used prices? William E. Franklin : It is. Craig Kennison : Will, you quoted a number, average tow zone, could you just clarify the meaning of that? Is that just the distance to travel? William E. Franklin : Yes, that\u2019s exactly what it is. Craig Kennison : Then Jay, on the international front obviously it makes a lot of sense, a lot of cars internationally that need to be insured and ultimately serviced by someone like you, but the economics tend to be unfavorable until you achieve some level of scale. What markets do you think are close to inflecting from a scale perspective? A. Jayson Adair : Well, I think we\u2019ll be there in all of our facilities this year. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have any international operations this year that aren\u2019t profitable. Craig Kennison : That\u2019s true in India as well? A. Jayson Adair : India is not up and running. India hasn\u2019t sold one car yet so that doesn\u2019t count in markets where we\u2019ve got people on the ground and we haven\u2019t processed a car yet. I\u2019m talking about where we\u2019ve got physical facilities and we\u2019re selling cars. Craig Kennison : Any way to quantify sort of the profit drag of those operations last year versus even if you get it back to neutral, what the impact would be financially? A. Jayson Adair : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary from the standpoint of we\u2019re expecting to see G&A come down this year. We\u2019re not going to be adding a material amount of cost internationally. So we\u2019ve got our footprint, we\u2019ll be seeing G&A come down this year and then we\u2019ll be expecting those international operations to become profitable this year. As that happens, we\u2019ll be expanding further in those markets. But as we expand that\u2019s profit driven, that\u2019s not going to bring the company down. If we have markets like India, to your example, where we end up adding additional costs, then we\u2019ll talk to that on the calls. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc. John Lawrence : Just real quick, if you look back two or three years Quad Cities and some of the other integration moves, can you just talk about obviously progressing to get to this point as far as the plan of reducing costs, all-in-all this is what you started to see and there\u2019s no real changes into that plan from that time point of basically when you moved to Dallas. Is that fair? A. Jayson Adair : Well, I\u2019d say this, we started the move from California which had a lot of costs baked into the company. You saw revenues increase in fiscal \u201911 when we started that move, you saw revenues increase in \u201912, \u201913, and \u201914 subsequent to that move. You then saw the cost of Hurricane Sandy come into the company, you then saw costs associated with Quad Cities, so we\u2019ve had I\u2019d say three years in a row of cost and then you can throw technology onto that as well, so we had three years in a row of technology costs and this will be the year clearly where we anticipate having record revenues and then rationalizing our costs this year as we talked about in the last call. John Lawrence : At the end of the day the only thing market driven that\u2019s really from a market standpoint that has impacted your progress has been a little bit of these tow costs and a little incremental services that it appears you\u2019re going to leverage on the other side anyways? A. Jayson Adair : Yes, we\u2019ve had some increase towing costs that came after Hurricane Sandy and Will said that earlier, we\u2019re going to rationalize that down. We\u2019ve opened up more locations so we\u2019ve seen the average tow zone or the distance we go to tow a vehicle, we\u2019ve seen that decrease. Part of that is mix, part of that is we\u2019ve got additional facilities that came through QCSA and some other stores that we opened up like ,we talked about Wheeling last quarter in Chicago. So yes, to your point, we\u2019ve had \u2013 there\u2019s been reasons for all this. We\u2019ve talked about why the reasons exist for the costs and now we\u2019re going to be seeing the benefits of higher revenue and then lowering those costs. Operator :  Your next question comes from David Karnofsky \u2013 JP Morgan. David Karnofsky :  Maybe just a quick housekeeping question on the tax rate, I think it was running at 36% in the quarter, could we still expect for the full year a little over 34%? William E. Franklin : Yes, I think it will be the high end of 34%. Our cash rate is seasonal, in our third quarter we always have true ups for 1048 reserves. But I think on an annual basis I think mid to high 34% is about right. Operator :  Thank you Mr. Franklin and Mr. Adair, there are no further questions in the queue at this time. A. Jayson Adair : Thank you everyone for attending the call and we look forward to reporting on the second quarter and wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Have a great rest of the day.",

L. King & Associates John Lawrence - Stephens Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Alright. Thank you, Noel. Good morning, everyone. Before we start, I am going to pass it over to Will Franklin, CFO, who will give us an update on numbers. I will give you a quick update on the company and then we will keep those remarks brief and then we will open it up for questions. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn it over to Will. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jay. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. So, with that I will begin by making a few brief remarks concerning the financial performance of our company in our second quarter. Total revenue declined by $10.2 million or 3.6% due to the change in the mix between cars sold as an agent and cars sold on a principle basis, which we refer to as purchased cars. Purchase car revenue declined by $13 million. As a percentage of total revenue, it declined 4 percentage points to 13.7%. Purchase car unit volume represented 6% of the total volume in the current quarter versus 6.8% the same quarter last year. The decline in purchase car revenue was driven primarily by reduced volume as direct purchase activity in both the UK and North America and cars purchased on behalf of insurance companies on a principle basis in the UK declined. Service revenue increased by $2.8 million driven primarily by volume as revenue per car remained relatively constant. On a year-over-year basis, in North America, unit sales grew by 2% and the inventory grew by 10%. On a consolidated basis, unit sales grew by 1% and inventory grew by 8% as the UK saw a reduction in both unit sales and unit in inventory. Our operation expenses decreased by $1.1 million. Adjusted for one-time QCSA integration cost of $2.2 million incurred in the same quarter last year, costs were up $1.1 million or 1%. The increase was due to growth in volume as the cost to process each car remained relatively constant. General and administrative costs declined by approximately $4.9 million. Same quarter last year contained $2.3 million in severance, lease termination and relocation cost associated with the QCSA integration and the move of our technology team from California to Texas. We have completed the QCSA integration and the IT department relocation. In addition, we have completed the transition in IT strategy in which we have moved away from the third-party ERP system and from a third-party solution for infrastructure and support. During the quarter, we expended $16.1 million for yard expansion, technology and equipment. This number also included one lease buyout. Finally, during the quarter, we refinanced our debt. We replaced our term loan A with a credit structure utilizing private placement debt in the amount of $400 million, due in four tranches ranging from 10 to 15 years, a term loan A of $300 million due in 2019, and a revolver of $300 million also due in 2019. At the end of the quarter, $681 million was outstanding, none of which was from the revolver. Currently, the blended interest rate is approximately 3.35%. Refinancing added approximately $2.5 million to our interest expense this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over the Jay Adair, our CEO for further color on the quarter. Jay Adair : Thank you, Will. In an effort not to repeat some of the information that Will just discussed with you, I am going to go ahead give you some additional information and maybe put some color around of some of the things that we are doing. We discussed the fact that revenues were flat. We had one less business day in this quarter as compared to same quarter a year ago. The rest of it I would say is timing due to a very strong Q1 this year as was witnessed and so some of those it just depends on when vehicles come in, when they are going to sell. And we saw some heavy sales in Q1, little slower in this quarter and I suspect we will see a good sell-off in Q3. Inventories as you heard are up 10% in North America and more importantly right now is the G&A has been a big focus for us on not only getting the cost down. I think that the quarter reflects modest effort so far. But more materially as the improvements that we are making in the home office both on a spend per person and how we are actually executing on the dollars that we spend in G&A, as well as the fact that total dollars are down. So, we are getting more as they say more bang for the buck on the dollars that we are spending. And we are actually reducing those numbers as well. So we are happy about that. Sale price was down in the quarter. We believe this is primarily due to scrap, scrap pricing has come off substantially, not only year-over-year but Q1 to Q2. And cycle times have remained relatively flat at this time. So we try to anticipate the questions, but I am sure there is something that we have missed. So at this time I would like to turn it over to Noel and we will go ahead and open it for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Will Franklin : Hi Bob. Bob Labick : Hi, just to start with a simple one, in terms of FX obviously there has been a huge currency swing over the last quarter or so could you tell us what if any, FX impact was on the top line sales on the quarter. And then just a little further what you expect if it impacts your export sales or how you expect the stronger dollar to impact you going forward? Will Franklin : Well, we are seeing a negative impact in both aspects. So it had a marginal impact on revenue. In the quarter it was about $3 million and primarily due to the change in the FX between the dollar and the pound. At the EBIT level it represented slightly les than $1 million of negative impact. It also had a detrimental impact on our export business slightly. So I think our \u2013 we have gone from about 25% to about 23.5% of our total volume being exported. Bob Labick : Got it. Thank you. And then in terms of obviously you had record volumes and proceeds are I think near highs certainly for your customers, you are just starting to get back to that gross margin recovery from the fact that you have increased your service level, is that \u2013 is this trend of two quarters of gross margin recovery sustainable and can you describe some of the services that you did increase to impact margins right now? Will Franklin : Well, as I have said many times. We don\u2019t focus on gross margin percentage because that\u2019s subject to the percentage of our sales that purchased car versus agency car. So we focus on EBIT per car. And when you look at that level we are \u2013 we have been growing for the last 3 quarters year-over-year. And the target is to reach where we were in 2012, but we are not there yet. But like I said we have had nice growth in that metric in the last 3 quarters on a year-over-year basis. Bob Labick : Got it. I suppose you won\u2019t say exactly what the target is in dollars or how close you are? Will Franklin : I am sorry we don\u2019t disclose that Bob. Bob Labick : Right. No, I assumed not, but I figured it \u2013 ask since you put it that way. And then last one obviously you said good control on the G&A side down to the 31%, 32% level. I think we have spoken about 31% to 33% being the sustainable run-rate once you got rid of the redundant expenses from QCSA and the IT transition. We were expecting that a little later in the year. Is the current level the right base and sustainable going forward? Will Franklin : Well, we think it is based on current activity. So, as we have talked about, there is a focus to expand internationally. And we think that, that will probably come into play in 2016 far more than it has 2015, but any change in our fundamental activity level will have a change on G&A, but at this activity level, this sales and volume level, this is probably an appropriate G&A level, G&A spend. Bob Labick : Okay, great. I will let others ask. Thanks very much. Will Franklin : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Jay Adair : Good morning. John Lovallo : First question, Jay, I just want to make sure that I understood your comments correctly on the timing of the service revenue department here. So, service revenue was up a little over 1% in the quarter and I think inventory at the end of last quarter was up about 9%. So, you are talking about timing, but I guess \u2013 was the flow through of those vehicles slower than expected? What am I missing I guess is the question? Jay Adair : Yes. We had a real big Q2. So, we are able to not only build inventory, but we had some large sales. You can compare that to \u2013 I meant, Q1 if I said Q2. You can compare that to Q1 of fiscal \u201814 and see that the growth in those two quarters as opposed to growth in Q2 a year ago versus Q2 this year. So, some of it is just timing, I mean, it\u2019s the type of vehicles you get the mix meaning some of our accounts move vehicles twice as fast as others on the insurance side. On the non-insurance side, we have got a mix of vehicles that are far more profitable, because they are dealer cars. And then as opposed to mix of vehicles that are more charity focused. So, it depends on mix. It depends on timing. And I just want to give you a little color that why the quarter when you look at it may look in terms of revenues a little soft. And as Will said, he pointed out that the purchase car activity, I was really just focused on the fact that the revenue aside from purchase cars and the fact that we had one less business day in the quarter this year than we did a year ago. So, those are the main factors I was trying to point out. Will Franklin : Yes, let me add one more element to that. So, our inventory grew at the end of the quarter. I mean, we had a significant increase in assignments towards the end of the quarter, which didn\u2019t allow us to cycle that through the sales process that will flow through in our third quarter. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just I guess on the vehicle sales line, the principle business here, is this a business that you guys see winding down completely over time? And I am just trying to think from a modeling standpoint here, I mean\u2026. Jay Adair : About the purchase cars? No, we will continue to do that. We have become focused on trying to make sure that when we process volume, we make a certain margin for handling cars and we are not making enough of a profit. We are exiting that type of business. So, no, we will continue to handle vehicles like that and you will continue to see that and I suspect it will grow actually in the future. What we have done right now is made some corrective changes that will bring it down and then we will come back, but at a higher margin. We are just at the end of the day we are not willing to grab market share in a particular segment like vehicles that we are purchasing them and then do it at a low margin. John Lovallo : Okay, great. And the final question you guys historically have been and I think you still are today very big believers in the business and I think you have demonstrated that through buying back a good amount of shares over time. I think, we over the past few years we have been hit with a number of things like the re-conversion noise, the acquisition integration, some of the ERP system stuff that went on. With a lot of that behind us now when you guys took on a turn of leverage, I mean, is it \u2013 how are you thinking about share repurchases going forward just broadly? Is this something that we should be thinking about could accelerate? Jay Adair : Well, we might want to add Sandy to that mix of all the items that you threw out as well, but we have said historically that it\u2019s something that we view as an opportunity for us to deploy cash as well as acquisitions, buying companies, expanding locations, buying out leases. So, it\u2019s one of the many and we have never given any guidance as to what dollar amount we will buyback or when we are going to buyback, but it is still something that we consider an option and something we discuss at the Board level. John Lovallo : Okay, appreciate it guys. Jay Adair : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Jay I want to follow-up on that question there, can you help us think about the decision to add internal leverage in the month of December, I understand the opportunities for acquisition or land assets or even buying back stock, but what was the trigger to say, okay we need to now bring this on to the balance sheet and pay money to have this flexibility and how do you think about timing of executing against that flexibility? Jay Adair : Sure. So I will give you an example back in 2008. Fiscal \u201808, we went out into the market and bought back stock, split adjusted off the top of my head. That\u2019s my qualifier there. I think it was in the 20s. And subsequent to the financial crisis our stock was in the 12s. We were sitting with a very low cash position and we reached out to the banks and as you can appreciate nobody was willing to loan money at that time. So having cash on our balance sheet is part of our thought process in terms of a fiscally prudent approach to the market. So we think interest rates are very low right now as a company, as a Board we are able to borrow debt that goes out 10 years to 15 years before it has to be paid off and it\u2019s cheap as Will gave you the rates earlier. So we viewed that as a smart move to go ahead and increase the amount of debt on our balance sheet to refinance the debt that was coming due this year. We had a couple of hundred million I believe that was coming due this year and that debt now has been pushed out roughly 5 years. So part of the restructure was it was the right thing to do. Part of increasing the debt, we felt was just a prudent approach to hedging if you will the future. So we are not sure what the market will do, and we are not sure if we will be able to \u2013 you don\u2019t know what your stock price is going to do. We are very bullish on the company. And if for some reason we had a financial issue again in the future as the country, we want to make sure we have got cash on hand and we are not in a position we are trying to reach out and borrow money at that time. So as a company and as a Board we felt it was important to go ahead and refinance the debt and also increase the amount of debt on our balance sheet. John Healy : It makes sense. And along the same lines I want to ask I know you guys kind of made it known that Will is going to be transitioning to more an operating role, and I was curious where you guys are at with the CFO search process? Jay Adair : We have SVP of Finance in the company. He is sitting in the room right now. His name is Bruce Bishop and we will have, Bruce who is a great guy. Bruce Bishop : Thank you. Jay Adair : And we have \u2013 Will has gone into a heavy operating role. And that\u2019s great. He is doing a fantastic job and Bruce has been taking over the financials. And so I will leave it at that and in the future if there is a change in CFO title, we will make that announcement. John Healy : Okay. Thank you. Jay Adair : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hey. Thanks for taking my call. I guess I will tackle the stock buyback, capital allocation, capital structure questions in maybe a different way. This is the first time that you ever had long-term debt on the balance sheet 10 years to 15 years you mentioned you have levered once before in the recent past, really only to buyback stock, but that was with a medium duration term loan and revolver which the contractual terms have you been immediately begin paying down. So is there anything philosophically that you are thinking differently when it comes to capital structure with having that the long-term debt on the balance sheet? Jay Adair : Well, this is the first time that we have seen interest rates for long-term debt at this level. I mean we picked up the $400 million of debt over 10 years before we had to pay it back and at a rate just over 4%. And that really is the first time that we saw an opportunity like that, A. B, we historically many of you in the analyst community I believe know this our founder Willis Johnson has historically built the company before we went public on debt and historically has been debt averse in the past when interest rates obviously were much higher than they are today. And so when interest rates got lower back in \u201810, \u201811 and the opportunity to put some debt on, we all agreed including our Chairman that it was something we should do. Now that we have seen interest rates get low for long-term debt, we believe that that was again something that made sense long-term. And then the last piece I would throw is because of the relationship that we have between our international entities and our U.S. entity there is some tax advantage that we get by having debt. And if we didn\u2019t have the debt, we would actually lose \u2013 we will lose the tax advantage basically. So, there is a benefit to having some debt, especially at these levels and especially these rates for the foreseeable future and that was really the reason for locking up some long-term debt. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the quarter. It looks like general and administrative expense fell nicely sequentially down I think like $7 million, is this the savings that was previously communicated regarding the non-implementation of that earlier planned ERP system, is this quarter\u2019s run rate now more or less clean or is there still some noise running through the data centers, headquarters\u2026? Will Franklin : Well, the change in the IT strategy is certainly part of that. We did incur significant amount of cost that reflected in the prior \u2013 actually 3 quarters ever since we took the impairment Q3 of last year to make that change. The other elements, which I spoke to were the costs associated with moving our IT department out from California and just the cost of integrating QCSA, which was the significant operation. And at this point, we think those costs are primarily behind us. There will always be one-time cost, and frankly if they are not significant, we won\u2019t point them out. But in general, at this activity level, we think this is appropriate run rate for our G&A spend. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. And then sticking with the quarter, one of your competitors recently mentioned lower scrap price weighing on pricing at salvage car auctions, are you seeing that and can you kind of just directly, proportionately size up how important scrap metal is versus the lower U.S. dollar are for pricing versus used car prices, which seemed to be holding up the best of all the factors? Will Franklin : Well, in the North America the scrap metal pricing had a significant impact on our lower end cars. Our overall base is there was a marginal decline. On a consolidated basis, because we had a growth in revenue per car and other areas of our operations internationally, they is relatively flat. In terms of important scrap metal pricing is a significant factor. So, I mean, we look at two primary drivers when we correlate our pricing and that\u2019s used car pricing and commodity pricing. And in terms of significance, I would weigh used car pricing is slightly more significant. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And then just last question for me if I can on the weather, I am in Miami today, but we have had a lot of snow in the New York, lot of snow in Boston. This seems like this is sort of weather that is good for you, it\u2019s not significant storm that leads to like extra expense in your parking, can you kind of confirm that. And then of course you have very difficult compares with favorable weather for a year ago, so how is weather going to play on your results over the next couple of quarters maybe on a year-over-year basis? Thanks. Jay Adair : Sure. I would just stay there, so it\u2019s hard to isolate on a call how weather comparison in the Northeast compared to the Midwest compared to West Coast, etcetera. We look at when we peak. And we peaked in inventories at the end of January and we have been selling off those inventories now in February. So, we continued to see strong volumes coming in, but we have seen the peak coming. Sometimes that peak is the first week of February, sometimes the second week of February. Right now, it peaked at the end of January and once you peak and you come off, which we have it won\u2019t go back to those levels. We are now selling off substantial amounts of units in February. And so again, I think it\u2019s going to be a good quarter based on the inventory build, based on the volume we are seeing come in. It\u2019s definitely not a bad winter, but we have a peaked already. Will Franklin : And I will add one more comment on that, as I have talked about the decline in volume in UK and we can trace that back to significant influence of weather. So, at this time last year, there were occurring floods in a number of areas in the UK, which made the comp for volume more difficult for us this quarter. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Jay Adair : Hi, Craig. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question as well. On market share, your largest competitor reported a 11% revenue growth in the similar period versus your 1% service revenue growth and I recognized very much that its apples and oranges when you are looking at those two metrics. But to what extent if any does it suggest you are not gaining shares quickly as your largest competitor? Jay Adair : I think both of us have been relatively mature in the last year. There was quite a few RFPs that went out over last two years and the mix has been very steady over the last year. And again, they are not completely comparable quarters. Theirs ends December, ours ends January, and January is the biggest month in terms of cost and building inventories in that process. So, I think the easy answer to give you is just that the mix hasn\u2019t really changed between either of us in last year. Craig Kennison : Okay. Will Franklin : Craig, I want to point one other thing, which is we are in a number of different markets. They tend to focus on just the insurance market, but we are in the charity market, we are in the repo market, and we are on what\u2019s called the market folks just buy and sell cars on our platform as part of their business. And so you have to look at each of those individually to conclude about where our market share resides. So, for example, in charities, we maybe up or not and that enters into our total volume mix. Craig Kennison : Did you see relative weakness in those non-insurance categories? Will Franklin : In certain categories, we did. Craig Kennison : Okay. Shifting gears to gas prices, just Will, give us a sense how lower gas prices will impact your revenue and cost structure? Will Franklin : Well, it typically has impact on our self-haul cost. And that\u2019s one element to those costs. I can tell you that there are so many other factors that enter into our average cost to pickup the car and probably the main one is the volume. When you have more volume, you have a reduced opportunity to select the low cost provider. We talked about that. But there is other elements and we are picking up a far higher percentage of cars on the same day than we did previously. Our pickup time is well below 1 day and is declining. When you are trying to provide better service to your insurance customers by picking up the cars faster, you have less opportunity to aggregate hauls. So, you have more single hauls in the total mix. So, despite the fact that we have declining diesel fuel pricing, we are challenged to reduce our self-haul cost on a per car basis. Craig Kennison : Good, that helps. And then maybe finally, Jay, on the dealer-to-dealer market and that whole car side, we have seen a number of business models pop up in this dealer-to-dealer space, where technology essentially disintermediates the physical auction to some extent. I am just curious you tend to like these disruptive models and have done well with technology. How do you see that market as a potential addressable market for Copart? Jay Adair : Well, for the industry, I think it\u2019s been slow to adopt. I expected 12 years ago that we would see much further progress in the adoption on that, especially on the whole car side. With respect to our dealer processing of vehicles, we added \u2013 and this maybe partially true for the whole cars as well. We provide a service by getting the vehicle off their lot. And I don\u2019t see that technology disrupting our business, because the dealers got limited space in the lot. They want those vehicles that they are not going to sell off the lot and they basically got two quick options. They can wholesale it or they can take it to auction. In both scenarios, it gets off the lot immediately. And if you are talking about using a technology to do a B2B process and get rid of the vehicle, it\u2019s sitting on the lot while they go through that. So, I suspect that those vehicles will continue to be vehicles we will get and will continue to grow in that segment, because it\u2019s not just returns, it\u2019s not just the ease of selling the vehicles, the fact that it\u2019s being physically moved. We don\u2019t sell vehicles typically at the lot, where the vast majority of our vehicles are being moved to our sites and so it\u2019s out of their \u2013 off their facility and that\u2019s a big improvement for them. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. Jay Adair : Thank you. Will Franklin : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning. Jay Adair : Good morning, Brad. Will Franklin : Good morning, Brad. Bret Jordan : Just a follow-up question on sort of the capital allocation and I think there was a comment about M&A and international expansion potential and obviously you have got liquidity, how are your thoughts about international growth, M&A given the fact that you wrote off the ERP system last year, are you thinking smaller size or relatively lower risk transactions because of the lack of an IT system or do they not really changes them all? Jay Adair : The ERP was really - I would put that separately and our reasons for doing the ERP and our reasons for exiting ERP are really separate from international markets. I mean we can grow internationally without the ERP and we are doing that. We are building systems to do that. Our desire to have an international footprint is the same as it was 10 years ago when we first expanded into Canada. It\u2019s been a strong desire and that eventually brought us to the UK and Brazil and Dubai and everywhere else that we do business. So we will continue to develop tools necessary to expand in those markets. And when the opportunities arise for us to make an acquisition in those markets we are going to do that. Bret Jordan : Okay, thanks. That was not a critical backbone for M&A integration, that was just another piece of the puzzle? Jay Adair : Correct. Bret Jordan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you again. Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong [C. L. King & Associates]. [Operator Instructions] Bill Armstrong : Good morning, guys. You already answered my question on market share, but I did have a question on the other income line you had a spike there to $4.1 million I just want to dig into a little bit, what\u2019s in there? Will Franklin : Well, it includes a number of different elements. It includes some rent, so we rent out properties and we don\u2019t include that in our operating income. It includes gain on the sale of fixed assets, but also includes an FX impact. So our hedging strategy is pretty simple. When we accumulate cash offshore, we convert it to USD. While the accounting rules which I can\u2019t explain but we hold this cash in USD to eliminate economic risk to the business. Nevertheless accounting rules make us recognize gain and loss on that cash relative to the home currency of the country that owns cash. In this situation we had USD owned by our UK entity and that generated a gain on FX in the UK. And now it\u2019s a primary driver in the spike. Bill Armstrong : How much was that out of that $4.1 million that ForEx gain? Will Franklin : Hold one second. It was about $3 million. Bill Armstrong : Okay. So going forward are we looking at maybe run rate of roughly $1 million a quarter on that other income line? Will Franklin : Well, it\u2019s hard to predict. It all hinges on the movement of the relative values of the different currencies. Bill Armstrong : Right, understood, okay. Thanks. Will Franklin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last and final question comes from John Lawrence with Stephens. John Lawrence : Good morning guys. Jay Adair : Good morning John. Will Franklin : Hey John. John Lawrence : Would you comment just a little bit \u2013 Will I don\u2019t know if you will give us this number, but what\u2019s the delta from when you talk about 12 at the peak of EBITDA or EBIT per car, how far are we away from that peak at this point? Will Franklin : No, I am sorry, I can\u2019t give you that. I have talked about directionally and directionally like I said we have seen a consistent growth in the EBIT per care and we can\u2019t look at it on a sequential quarterly basis because of the seasonality of business. So we got to reach back 2 years and like what we did in the same quarter, \u201813 and \u201814 and we have had a nice growth. John Lawrence : Yes. I mean is it unfair to compare that to that operating margin 32 to 32.5 back in June of \u201912? Will Franklin : You really can\u2019t look at it on a percentage basis. Size of the impact of purchased car activity. You have to look at on EBIT per car basis. John Lawrence : Got it. And secondly to follow on Bret\u2019s question, Jay can you comment just the environment what you are seeing over there expand that internationally the environment what are you seeing over there as far as progress in the industry that may or may not want to expand and at what point? Jay Adair : Well, I guess I would just comment by saying that we have people on the ground. We have got operating businesses. The first step would be expanding operating businesses that are already there. And then we have got people on the ground in new markets that where we don\u2019t do any volume yet and we have got relationships with opportune acquisition targets and when the time arrives and when we feel it\u2019s the right time to do that, we will step into those markets as new markets. Right now, we are really focused on improving the markets we are already in before we expand into new. John Lawrence : And there is nothing that\u2019s changing that\u2019s causing you to think about pulling back or anything like that? Jay Adair : No, I mean we are always \u2013 each market you look at they are going to have their own tax laws, they are going to have their own process. Sometimes, we have got to build systems around the new tax law before we can get into that market. Sometimes, we have got a completely different process than we are familiar with in the U.S., UK, Brazil as an example, Dubai. And so we have to go into a market and convert that existing process that they have got to a new model and show them that the model is better. So, it just depends market by market and some markets you can move quicker than others, but we are committed to that strategy of expanding our global footprint. John Lawrence : Great. Thanks for your help. Jay Adair : Thank you. Will Franklin : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay Adair. Jay Adair : Thank you, Noel and thank you everyone for coming on to the second quarter call. We look forward to reporting Q3 in 90 days. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

King & Associates John Lawrence - Stephens Inc. Bret Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets Operator : Excuse me everyone, we now have our speakers in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, CEO. Sir, please begin. Jay Adair : Thank you, Katie. Well good morning everyone to the Third Quarter Conference Call for Copart. We are very pleased with the results of the third quarter. Will Franklin will give you an update on the quarterly financial results after my brief introduction and commentary on Q3. I'd like to start with a review of average selling price. Will Franklin : Can you do Safe Harbor? Jay Adair : Oh, I'm sorry. I was firing away, I was ready to go. Yes, we've got Safe Harbor and then I'll jump in. Okay. Will Franklin : Good morning everyone this is Will Franklin. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jay Adair our CEO to begin the comments on our third quarter results. Jay. Jay Adair : Thank you, Will. We were just saying before the call that this is probably the 80th conference call we've done since we went public for over 20 years now. And I think that's the first time I forgot to introduce Will for the Safe Harbor. So, as I said already we're really pleased with the quarter and I want to give you an update on the quarter just some brief commentary and then Will, will give you an update on the financial results for the quarter. So I'd like to start by talking about average selling price. In the quarter we saw further softening of average selling price as what we refer to as ASPs, compared to the second quarter. Looking at May data, average selling price has dropped again, but we believe we are currently at the bottom in terms of where salvage values will end up for the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect this trend of low ASPs to continue into our future quarters and do not anticipate that average selling price will bounce back in the next couple of quarters. We believe the cause of this lower ASP or average selling price is due primarily to lower scrap prices and softer international bidding. The lower scrap prices affect many of the lower end vehicles that we sell. The lower scrap price is caused by weakening global demand and a strong U.S. dollar. The softer international bidding primarily affects the higher end units that we sell and is primarily caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. Additionally, we have seen the age of U.S. fleet increase for the past seven years and as we discussed on previous calls older vehicles will sell for last and auction. With the older fleet, we have seen total loss frequency increase. We believe this trend will continue as the fleet ages and so with the likelihood of the vehicles becoming total losses. We also believe repair cost are up increasing the number of total loss vehicles and fuel prices being lower are causing miles driven to go up again causing more accidents and more total loss vehicles. We believe the trend of vehicles aging will continue. Therefore average selling price should continue to be soft and volume should be up for the foreseeable future. As we have also discussed on previous calls, there's a natural hedge in our business that when ASPs fall volume increases. This will cause our revenue per car to drop, but volume to increase offsetting for the most part the drop in revenue per car. Cycle times for the quarter did not increase materially and inventory increased approximately 12%, comparing the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015. We are pleased with the improvements in G&A specifically the reduction in cost made in the quarter and Will Franklin, will give you more detail on his update on the financial results. That concludes my remarks. This time I'm going to pass it to Will for a financial update and then we\u2019ll open it up for question and answer. Thank you. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jay. Let me provide a few details on our financial performance before we open it up to Q&A. Total revenue declined by $12.6 million or 4.1%. We saw good growth in volumes increasing by 5.4% in North America and 5.2% worldwide. We saw reduction in the revenue per car due to decline in auction average selling price. The decline in ASPs resulted from lower commodity pricing and the impact of the stronger dollar. In April 2014, the index for crushed car bodies, as issued by American recycler stood at $273 per ton. That same index was at $143 per ton at the end of April 2015. We believe this index to be highly correlated to dismantler and junk buyers behavior. In addition, the strengthening dollar suppressed participation by our international buyers as the percentage of unit sold to international buyers was the lowest since our third quarter of fiscal 2009. And the percentage of value sold to international buyers was a lowest since our first quarter for 2005. Finally the stronger dollar against primarily the pound, the real and the euro on a year-over-year basis resulted in a reduction of total revenue of approximately $6.8 million, compared with same quarter last year. Purchase car revenue declined by $14.1 million or 25.8%. The decline resulted from reductions in both the number of vehicle sold and average selling price of those vehicles. As a percentage of total revenue, purchase car revenue declined by four percentage points to 13.7%. Purchase car unit volume represented 6% of total volume in the current quarter versus 6.4% in the same quarter last year. The purchase car volume was impacted by the reduction of insurance vehicles processed through purchase contracts in the U.K. In addition to the impact of commodity pricing and the stronger dollar, the average selling price of purchased vehicles was also impacted by a change in mix. As a higher percentage of cars came from our direct purchase program versus our insurance suppliers. In our direct purchase program we buy and sell cars for our own account. Service revenue remain relatively flat increasing by $1.5 million or less than 1% as the increase in car volume was offset by a reduction in revenue per car. Yard operation expenses increased by $2.9 million or 2.3%, and was driven entirely by increased volume. Cost to process each car declined marginally. General and administrative costs declined by $6.1 million. In the same quarter last year, we have $1.4 million in severance, lease termination and relocation cost associated with our QCSA acquisition and the move of our technology team from California to Texas. Further reduction came primarily from savings garnered from the rationalization of technology resources associated with the abandonment of certain software and technology strategies. This change in strategies which began with the $29.1 million impairment in the third quarter of last fiscal year is now complete. On an overall basis, the change in FX reduced EBIT by approximately $1.3 million, compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we expanded $9.6 million for yard expansion, equipment, and technology. In our second quarter of this year we refinanced our debt. This refinancing added approximately $3.8 million to our interest expense this quarter, compared to same quarter last year. Finally we exited the quarter with $679 million in cash. That concludes my comments. We'll turn the call back over to you Katie to monitor the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick from CJS Securities. Bob Labick : Good morning. Will you just touched on this in your comments, I was hoping maybe you could elaborate further. You mentioned that the yard cost was slightly faster than the overall sales service costs and so therefore I guess gross profit on a service revenue basis was down slightly. It has been growing in the last few quarters, can you talk about the drivers there and where you expect the yard cost to go and this is all, as you said volume related or what are the other moving parts there? Will Franklin : Sure, it's real simple. It's volume and it's cost to process each car. So we have far less volatility in our cost to process each car its movement than far less than the revenue associated with those cars. So when we see a decline in revenue on a per car basis, it's detrimental to our margin percentages. Bob Labick : Okay. And I think Jay, you mentioned you think we're getting closer to a bottoming in that trend. Certainly in the current quarter, but you don't expect it to rise any time soon, is that what you said? Jay Adair : That's right. If you look at Q2 to Q3, we saw softening and average selling price and if you look at the month of May which is the first month of our fourth quarter, we\u2019re at a number right now that we believe will be consistent with the quarter. We don\u2019t think it we will drop more than that in the fourth quarter than we are at currently. And borrowing U.S. dollar, borrowing fuel price changes and other what I had called macroeconomic factors, we think that the continued trend of the ASP where it\u2019s currently out will continue and that\u2019s looking as well, Bob at volume. So looking at existing inventory levels and current volume coming in that's driven by volumes go up as I stated in the commentary that volumes go up when ASP's come down. And so we haven't really seen used car pricing come down yet. We think it\u2019s going to come down. We think - we tend to be a leading indicator for that looking back at data that we had back in 2008, we could see that. So we would anticipate the used car pricing will probably come off in the coming quarters and we don't anticipate our pricing coming down further from where we are already at and then if - obviously if those change used car pricing goes up, scrap goes up, then we would anticipate volume to slow a little bit. That's the natural hedge, volume would slow, and then ASP\u2019s would come back up. Bob Labick : Okay, great. Very good color there, thank you. And then just excluding FX, wanted to ask a little bit about your international business. You talked a little bit about Brazil, Germany, Spain, and the Middle East, where you stand in those. Are they still in investment phase, are they breakeven, profitable? And where you see them in three to five years? Jay Adair : Sure. Brazil, I guess I could go through each country, but Brazil is profitable, the Middle East is profitable, Germany and Spain are profitable, that's to say that they are quarters we were down, there are quarters we were up, but in general we\u2019re profitable internationally. We tend to view the international segment as one - as for the international team as one group and we have further investment that we\u2019re making in all including the U.K. We've got technology that we are utilizing in all those markets to run those operations. We are building technology currently that will help us to improve the service offerings in those markets. In Brazil specifically there will be some technology coming that replicates what we have done in the rest of the U.S., Middle East, U.K. model. In Germany we have got a completely different model, as well as Spain and so we are talking about technology and service offerings that we're going to bringing to market that is really completely new in those markets. So, I don't know specifically, you asked are we still in the investment stage, yes, we are going to continue to be looking at some pretty dramatic change in many of those markets excluding the U.K. The U.K. what I would call very mature at this point in terms of product offerings. We have been there almost a decade now. So when you get into Germany, Spain, Middle East, and Brazil and the other markets, we are going to continue to make improvements to the model and a lot of that is technology, a lot of that is footprint too adding locations and we're in the middle of doing those things, those investments now. Bob Labick : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Higginbotham from SunTrust. Robert Higginbotham : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Your inventories still up double digits, and was up double digits last quarter as well. You definitely saw an acceleration in volume trends from 2Q to this quarter. Should we think about seeing further acceleration in those volume trends as that inventory gets released? Jay Adair : Well, I would reply to that question by going back to 2012 with Hurricane Sandy that was the first enormous bump we saw in inventories and we're in fiscal '15 today and we've seen an increase year-over-year from 2012. I mean an increase that historically you didn't expect, we have always seen inventory increases associated with new volume, or I should take new accounts, let me say that way as oppose to accounts that are just expanding because of the market. And what we've seen over the last three years is just an expansion of inventory and an increase in volume specifically in the last year associated with accounts that we know we have a 100% of the business, and yet they have increased. So this is some of the color we're trying to give in the beginning about, we believe that right now with the increased aging of the fleet that we see and it\u2019s not just U.S. but also U.K. So we tend to think of it globally and with the increased aging of the fleet, we're seeing more total loss vehicles and so it\u2019s a little bit of a transition, so it\u2019s hard to predict. If you would have asked me a year ago, what we have anticipated year-over-year inventory growth of 12% in the third quarter, I would have said no and yet it happened. So it's hard to predict at this point, how much volume we\u2019re going to see increasing. I can tell you that from looking at May we're anticipating some high sales in terms of volume in the fourth quarter but of course as I said earlier, we've got a softer ASP in the fourth quarter then we had in the third quarter. So we\u2019re going to be seeing some erosion in margin associated with that, or we\u2019re going to see an increase in volume, associated with the reliving of that inventory. Robert Higginbotham : Got it, thanks. And on your balance sheet, I think many are still surprised that you haven't deployed the cash you raised recently in some form or fashion. Could you remind us kind of what your preferences for capital allocation are? And maybe as part of that - meaning how that cash would be likely to be deployed, and then as part of that, what the potential acquisition landscape looks like? Are there a fair amount of willing sellers out there? You probably can't talk to anything you might be currently involved in, but kind of what does that opportunity set look like? Jay Adair : Yes, we get quite a few opportunities throughout the year for acquisitions and once that you would be familiar are the ones that we actually close on, the ones that we pass on obviously we never comment on. We tend to do, I wouldn't say there is a priority of whether it's expanding locations, adding footprint, buying companies or buying stock back. The priority is set based on values so we tend to look at what is out there, what can we buy and what's the ROI and we go for the scenario where the ROI is the highest. We wanted to, in the last quarter we talked about our debt, we wanted to fix some debt that was coming due, out ten years plus and so we took $400 million of debt on that would be ten year or greater maturity. And then we've got the remainder of that debt it comes due in less than five and that was to afford us the opportunity to basically execute on our capital strategy which is to either require businesses, open up additional locations, expand locations or to buyer stock back. Robert Higginbotham : Got it, thanks for that. I'll hand it off to someone else, thank you. Jay Adair : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Ryan, and thanks for taking the call. Now the first question I had is, maybe just going back to a discussion on the impact from the stronger dollar at the high end of the vehicles at the auction, and then the impact from the lower scrap prices. Can you help us with what portion of your vehicles at your auctions are sort of at the high end and are getting influenced by the stronger dollar? And what is the portion that is getting more influenced by the scrap prices? Maybe just pick that out for us possibly? Jay Adair : I would say in terms of scrap and it's - we\u2019re looking at each other based on your question because in terms of scrap, I would argue 50% of the cars we sell are eventually going to be impacted by scrap, and that maybe high. It may be something less than that, but if we say 50% of the vehicles are impacted meaning that they maybe parted out, either completely scraped out in a self service fashion or that will be parted out in a full service fashion and eventually the scrap value will matter, it's much less significant, when we get into the full service approach but it's still matters. When you go above that, let's just say the other 50%, those tend to be vehicles that are either ready to be driven or they're going to be repaired. And in that scenario, the dollar has a big impact because we sell about a quarter of our vehicles historically overseas and so when we start talking about overseas buyers and the impact of the dollar, it can wait pretty heavily on overseas buyers to build competed auction to buy product. So hopefully that answers your question in terms of both. Unidentified Analyst : No, that's very helpful color. So maybe just following on from that, can you talk a bit about market share, since I think your major competitor reported like 8% volume growth, and I was wondering if these two factors, is there a difference in the mix, here, that's really driving that difference on the volume growth front? Jay Adair : I think when you're trying to compare us, you're looking at their quarters that end March and you\u2019re looking at us on a quarter that ends April, and you can't compare those two quarters. The inventory peak ends up being the end of January usually for second week of February, somewhere in that period, and then we are unloading enormous amounts of inventory going forward. So its hard to compare sales, its hard to compare inventory and that other factors you\u2019re looking at year-over-year data. So a lot of has to do with timing as well, how one year, a year ago compared to this year, this year, I just give you that kind of - make sure that you\u2019re looking at that component of the timing. Unidentified Analyst : Sure. Maybe on the last earnings call, you were referring to inventory build sort of happening towards the end of the quarter and you're starting to see that strength come through in February, I believe. So, just wanted to sort of get your thoughts on the peak volumes in the quarter play out according to expectation? And I believe you said that inventories right now are 12% up, year-on-year. Is that adjusted - I believe you always give a same-store number on the inventory or like-for-like number. Is that the exact number that you see it? Will Franklin : Yes, that's total inventory, that's not a same store correct. Jay Adair : Right, I mean play out exactly like we thought. Our same-store sales were 5.6% this quarter, they were less than 2% last quarter. Inventory was up I believe, well under 8% overall last quarter and this quarter on overall basis there are up 11%. So we\u2019re seeing a growth in both volume and inventory and as you know in our business our inventory is - the perfect indicator whatever sales maybe the next quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks a lot for taking our questions, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong with C. L. King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, Will and Jay. Most of my questions were answered, but I did have one. The G&A was a little bit less than I was modeling. Should we be kind of looking at that sort of 30 million per quarter run rate, going forward? Or were there any non-recurring items in that number, in the quarter you just reported? Jay Adair : Yes Bill, I would expect it to grow, so we executed on the change in IT strategy and we got to kind of the bone, and now we\u2019re seeing then we need to add resources to develop new products and expand internationally. So I would expect that to grow. I would say, I'm not going to give you number but its going to be north of $30 million going forward. Bill Armstrong : Maybe in the low $30 millions, would that be sort of a ballpark to use? Will Franklin : Fair enough. Low 30s. Bill Armstrong : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Will Franklin : Welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Lawrence from Stephens. John Lawrence : Good morning guys. Will, on the financial piece of the business. Looking at that, with your expanded role, what's the status of CFO role? I know there's been some changes on that side of the business, can you help us - what's the prospects there, and what are the plans on that staffing? Will Franklin : The important thing to understand, we got a really seasoned inventory staff. I mean we have got 3 VPs, VP of tax, VP of SEC reporting and compliance, and VP of transactional accounting. So, in addition, we have other resources at the senior leadership team that help in that area. We will make a move when it\u2019s right for our company but you shouldn\u2019t worry about anything fall to the cracks. We are well staffed, we have got - I think, a wonderful team of accounts that looks over SEC compliance and 404 compliance issues. So, we will make that move when it\u2019s appropriate. John Lawrence : Yes, I was just - Yes, I'm sorry Jay Adair : I might add to that John because Will is not going to brag on themselves, so I\u2019ll brag on. He's been our CFO for the last 11 years and the hiring process that we are going to go through and bringing in an SVP candidate is to eventually pass the CFO title to that person. That's a transition so that it moves from Will to that new person, that new role and allows Will to fully function or fully focus on the EVP role that he holds. But he never has given up the CFO title since we started that transition, just so you know. John Lawrence : Yes, I understand. I was just looking at it from the standpoint - from his standpoint, to be more effective in that other role, is what I was thinking. Jay Adair : That's right. And that\u2019s exactly why we are in the process of hiring for that SVP role so that we can eventually transition that over time and Will can be that much more effective. John Lawrence : Last question, I hate to go back to the buyback. Just can you give us a little bit more sense of just a deeper dive into that discussion on return on investment, et cetera? I would assume with these changes, getting the G&A out of the way, I understand the cycle of the business, but can you just give us another thought process of the stock? At this point, appears to be a pretty good reinvestment. Jay Adair : We never comment on the calls about the stock price and how we feel about it or how we view it . All I can tell you, or what price we buy that, all I can say is that it\u2019s something we did discuss at the board level and we compare our company with other opportunities. We always view the acquisition of another company that grows in our industry against our own stock price and you will have seen historically where we've acted upon that. So, I\u2019ll leave it with that. John Lawrence : Yes, and I'm sorry. Last question would just be - the point of this cycle would be, and I assume from a numbers standpoint is, Will, to your point, the G&A has come down, you've got that to the bare bones. Now the leverage point gets accelerated as ASPs go back the other way? Jay Adair : Of course. Absolutely right. John Lawrence : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from BB&T Capital Markets. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. Just a question on insurance cycle times. Is this a new normal, or where are we? We had a slowdown for a period of time, and I guess if you look at velocity of inventory working through the channel, could you give us an update on where we are, relative to maybe the old normal, and what times look like today? Jay Adair : As I said in my opening remarks, it hasn't moved materially. It went up slightly, I mean 2%, 2% is nothing. So, it\u2019s not a material movement and I believe we are in the new norm. Overtime I also believe that the cycle times will improve but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen in the next couple of quarters especially with the volume that we are taking just right now from some of the flooding and flash flooding and weather that you\u2019re seeing across the country. We are already seeing some upticks in volume there. So, I wouldn't expect cycle times to calm down in the next couple of quarters but in the long half, in the long term we all expected those cycle times will go more like they were, to what they were a couple of years ago. Bret Jordan : Okay, and so we should think about inventory levels, assuming cycle times are longer but stable, sort of cycling through a linear basis? That what you're holding now, we should see clear relatively soon? Jay Adair : We are holding now, we would expect to move in Q4. The difference in that, I\u2019m cautious to say that when we report a big inventory built in Q4. We may be selling off Q3 inventory and we are building a ton of inventory right now due to flooding and other components. So, it's not as simple to say, it's just going to flop, we may be end up high in Q4. But eventually to your point, this is the number, this is - we haven\u2019t seen cycle times continue to tick-up and a cycle time number we\u2019re comfortable with, and that should start to move out through Q4, Q1, Q2 and becomes the norm. Bret Jordan : Okay. Thank you. Jay Adair : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further question. I\u2019ll now turn it back over for closing remarks. Jay Adair : All right. Thank you Katie and again, Will and I appreciate your coming on the call and we look forward to reporting the next quarter and the fiscal year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Bill Armstrong - C. L. King & Associates Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Operator : Excuse me everyone, we now have our speakers in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Adair. You may begin. Jay Adair : Thank you. And it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter call before we start I\u2019m going to transfer it over to Will Franklin who will do our Safe Harbor, then he\u2019ll pass it back to me I\u2019ll give you a quick update, he\u2019ll review the financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. And with that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Will. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jay. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the final results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis and the risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call back to you Jay to begin the comments on our fourth quarter results. Jay Adair : Thank you, Will. Will will give you an update on the financials for the quarter, so I\u2019m going to focus primarily on some of the successes that we achieved in the quarter and in the year. We had a great year, we had a great quarter. We did start off the year with significantly higher ASPs, or average selling prices, of cars and we saw those average selling prices come down from Q1 to Q2 all the way to the end of the year. So there were some unanticipated headwinds that we faced in that because as vehicle sale price sells for less we end up generating less revenue on a per unit sold. We believe the primary driver of this was the decrease in scrap and the lower scrap prices basically caused buyers to pay less for the cars that we were auctioning off. In addition to that we would throw in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that took place during the same time frame in the last fiscal year, again making it harder for international buyers to pay as much at auction for vehicles that we were selling. So in spite of these headwinds and these challenges, we had a record year and a record quarter and as I said I\u2019ll leave that to Will to talk about. Beginning of the year we talked about our focus on G&A and in the quarter we made huge improvements in our G&A so I would call that out so that there is some focus by the analysts and by investors to look at the improvements that we made, it\u2019s \u2013 it can be very hard for companies in a growth mode adding locations and making improvements to the business at the same time reduce G&A and our teams has been really really successful this year in getting that done and executing on those fronts and we\u2019re really proud of them for that. Across the board from operations to sales, to our technology teams we\u2019ve produced improvements for the company and you\u2019ll see the fruits of those improvements in the year that we are currently in and so we expect to in Q1, 2, 3 and 4 this year to be launching some new products, opening up in some new markets and driving volume for the company associated with that. In the UAE, we added two more facilities this year in Oman and Bahrain in the fourth quarter and we finished the year with 183 yards worldwide of which 28 are now outside of the U.S. We now have two years of vehicle sales with our third generation virtual bidding technology; we refer to that as VB3. This as an example, this platform enables us this year to sell a vehicle, a 2003 Ferrari Enzo located in East Bethel, Minnesota to a buyer not too far away in Essex, Maryland. We often give these great stories of vehicle selling in all sorts of foreign countries and I\u2019ve got another one that I\u2019ll give you that is similar to that. This is one that\u2019s not too far away but the price is the key. It\u2019s the most expensive vehicle we sold in a year is $706,000. We had five Teslas that we sold this year to buyers in Ukraine. I thought that was interesting that they are buying those types of vehicles and it just really speaks to the power of VB3 and our technology and our ability to drive results even in the face of those headwinds that we talked about in the form of low scrap prices and the U.S. dollar. In previous calls we\u2019ve talked about the average sale price, I\u2019m sorry the average age rather of vehicles that were selling in 2008 that average vehicle age was 8.6 years, in 2011 it\u2019s grown to 9.7 and it is currently in 2015, 11.4. We believe that\u2019s going to drive additional unit volume as it has in the past as vehicles are ageing their probability of becoming total loss is going up and so you\u2019ll see and you\u2019ll hear from Will some investments that we made in additional locations, expansions etcetera to make sure that we have the capacity to handle the additional volume that continues to come in. And then finally I\u2019ll just close with another queue on technology that mobile technology we launched our mobile app, first mobile app in 2013 on the iPhone platform; we launched the android platform this year and I\u2019m happy to say that we have received over 8.8 billion worth of bids now via mobile and in 2015 we finished selling now 12.5% of our vehicles over mobile devices, so it has become a very strong part of our platform and again I think back to the days of having to physically sell through auctions and putting those auctions online allowed buyers to eliminate travel and weather and all the other friction points and now you don\u2019t even have to be in your office, you can literally be bidding on vehicles from the local Starbucks and we are seeing that now as 12.5% of our bids are coming in through mobile devices. So with that, I\u2019ll transfer it over to Will and then upon his completion we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A. Thank you very much. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jay, let me make a few brief comments about our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue declined by $5.2 million or 1.8% as the growth in volume was offset by a decline in revenue per transaction. And the impact, a change of the percentage of cars sold on a principal basis which carry higher revenue per transaction versus cars sold on a agency basis. Overall, volume grew by 8.2%. In North America it grew by 8.6%. The decline in ASPs resulted primarily from lower commodity pricing and the impact of the stronger dollar. The index for crushed car bodies, which we believe to be highly co-related to junk and dismantler buyer behavior declined by over 44% year-over-year. The stronger dollar continued to inhibit auction participation on international buyers and impacted the ultimate selling prices. Finally the stronger dollar against primarily the pound, the real and euro on a year-over-year basis resulted in a reduction of total revenue of approximately $5.8 million. Purchase car revenue declined by $7.6 million or 16.4%. The decline resulted from reduced auction selling prices as the volume remains relatively flat. In addition to the impact of commodity pricing and the stronger dollar, the average selling price was impacted by a change in mix as the higher percentage of cars came from our direct purchase program versus our insurance suppliers. In our direct purchase program we buy and sell cars for our own account. While purchase car volume remains flat on an absolute basis, it declined as a percentage of total units sold. Service revenue remains relatively flat, increasing by $2.4 million or 1% as the increase in agency car volume was offset by a reduction in revenue per car and the impact of FX. Yard operation expenses declined by $900,000 and was driven by a reduction in average cost to process each car and the beneficial impact of FX. General and administrative costs declined by $7.2 million. In the same quarter last year it contained $1.1 million in one-time costs associated with the restructuring of our technology, strategy and the relocation of our technology department from California to Texas. In the current quarter, reductions came primarily from the rationalization of technology resources, lower legal expenses and the beneficial impact of FX. We expect our G&A cost to increase in fiscal 2016 due to growing international activity. On an overall basis, the change in FX reduced EBIT by approximately $1.5 million. During the quarter we expended $30.1 million for yard expansion, equipment, and technology. This included $9 million in lease buy-ups. Finally, during the quarter we expended $233.5 million for the repurchase of approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $36 per share. We exited the quarter with $456 million in cash at $645.8 million in bank and private placement debt. With that, we\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Katie to manage the Q&A segment of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities Incorporation. Bob Labick : Good morning, congratulations on a nice quarter. Jay Adair : Hi, Bob. Will Franklin : Thank you, Bob. Bob Labick : I wanted to start -- the service gross margins were up year-over-year despite the FX and scrap you alluded to and Will you just mentioned that it was I think due to the lower processing cost per car, that trend had been growing up a little while ago, can you talk about the drivers and how you lowered the cost to process each car and where you expect that to go over the next several quarters? Will Franklin : Sure. First off we\u2019ve cycled completely through the integration pain of the QCSA acquisition. And second, and probably more importantly is we\u2019re starting to gain the efficiencies that are \u2013 we are starting to see again the efficiencies that are endemic in our model and that is we have a lot of fixed cost in that and if you exclude the titling cost and the sell whole cost almost all of our cost are fixed and two of the most important metrics that we look at are the number of cars per head and number of cars per yard and both those were up nicely during the quarter. So, we're starting to see the benefit of what we call fixed cost absorption in our processing cost. And then the third element of that is, Sean Eldridge, our Chief Operating Officer and his team have worked extremely diligently to carve out any waste in our system and he has been very successful in last year in doing so. Going forward, I wouldn't expect to see a meaningful change. I think that we'll control the cost, but I wouldn't expect to see significant reductions going forward. Bob Labick : Okay. Thank you. And then on to growth opportunities internationally in particular, could you give us an update on the German market and your process there, what's going on there? And any luck in terms of turning it more towards the U.S. style insurance market? Jay Adair : Sure, we've had growth in that market in the year with our existing business that's there. And we are poised to enter into that market in the next calendar year. So, I always hate to speculate on when that will happen and how that will look. But the plan is that as soon as we are open we'll make an announcement as we've always done with press releases and then we can talk about that further, Bob, on calls as to the success we're having in that market. We've \u2013 so Germany \u2013 clearly Germany is the biggest opportunity. We've also grown in the Middle East and we've grown in Brazil, so across the board if you roll up the international team as a unit or as a whole as we do, as we think about it, we've seen growth or we're seeing growth rather throughout the whole market, so we're happy with it, it\u2019s been good. Bob Labick : Great. Thanks. And then last one. And I'll get back in queue. You mentioned the $30 million in CapEx, and I think you said $9 million in land. Was that U.S. land? Was that international? And do you have any idea for a ballpark of CapEx for next year? Will Franklin : No, actually that $9 million was lease buyouts, so I guess you could say that's land. There's other outlying [purchase] [ph] of land that's included in the 30 \u2013 that $30.1 million. All those least buyouts were domestic in nature. We generally don't make predictions and give guidance on CapEx because of the uncertainties that surround buying these lands. You can imagine how difficult it is to get zonings and how sometimes we can get up to the very moment of closing a deal and find out we don't have the right zoning and we have to start all over again, so it\u2019s really hard to predict how much we'll be spending in a certain period of time. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Jay Adair : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, good morning, guys. Jay Adair : Good morning. Will Franklin : Good morning. Ben Bienvenu : So you referenced growth in G&A over time, that was a source nice upside in the quarter and you guys have done a good job at reducing absolute dollars spent on G&A. What's a reasonable expectation for where that should go and how high off of this level where we are today, do you think we could see that skew? Will Franklin : Well, once again we hesitate to give guidance in that other than to tell you that there's going to be more upward pressure in the absolute number during the course of fiscal 2016. That would be driven primarily by like I said international expansion, some of that will be driven by the need to add more resources in our technology rollout for rollout of some of our technology. I actually wouldn't expect it to grow much faster than -- and I think they'll be leveragable. Ben Bienvenu : And then maybe just touching on the tender offer and share repurchase. Stock is now below where the tender offer was done? You still have quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet. You generate nice cash. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts around your outlook for share repurchase, your strategy there, and how you think about allocating capital given the surplus of cash on your balance sheet? Jay Adair : We're always hesitant to discuss on calls how we view buying stock back. We just put it this way that tender price as you stated already was higher than the current price and the amount that we have to buy in was higher than what we ended up selling. And so, I think most investors can probably read between the lines on that how we view the stock. So, we discuss this at the Board level and if it\u2019s something that we think makes sense going forward then we'll do it. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. And then last question from me. You've seen in recent quarters, typically the correlation between your unit growth and your largest competitor over the last couple of years has been a fairly tight correlation. But in the last couple of quarters you've seen that disparity widen and while your unit growth has been strong, it hasn't matched up with your peer and it hasn't matched up with the inventory growth that we've seen it. I'd be just curious to see, help us understand what's going on the unit growth side, so I can get better clarity there? Jay Adair : Well, I'm not sure what you're looking at. We don't disclose units and they don't disclose units, so it's very difficult for us to be able to see what units they're selling compared to us and vice versa. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. So, you referenced unit growth up 8.2% in this most recent quarter, they had unit growth up 14%, those are sort of the numbers that I'm looking at. Will Franklin : Yes. We're a lot larger company in terms of volume, so when you talk percentages I think that's one piece I would look at. The other thing is, it\u2019s timing. Our quarters don't line up. And you're talking about months that are going to be more -- have more activity in them than other months. So as a company for us having the kind of growth that we're seeing right now, we're really, really happy with it. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. And then, sorry, one last one quick on just housekeeping, what was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter? Will Franklin : Yes, 130.2 million. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. The first question I had was primarily related to the impact or the influence on pricing that you're seeing from this stronger USD, like the interest or demand you're seeing from International buyers. And curious to know if you can sort of ballpark for us what percentage of your buyer at your U.S auctions are international buyers and sort of give us a sense what influence that is having? Will Franklin : Normally we look at the number of units sold internationally, but more importantly we look at the value of what we're selling internationally. And in this quarter that was down to 21.8% as a comparison in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 that was 29.3%. So we're seeing a significant impact on their behavior because of the stronger dollar. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And [indiscernible] sequentially going down through the quarters, through each quarter this year, is that good way to think about that? Will Franklin : No, actually sequentially we're flat. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Okay. Great. The second question I had was more about like in the -- what you\u2019re seeing now in terms of lower scrap prices etcetera which is pressuring pricing. Can you sort of talk about what levers do you have or what capability that you to take pricing to be able to offset some of this pressure that you're seeing? Jay Adair : We don't discuss pricing on conference calls. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. That's fine. And I just had a housekeeping question which was I didn't sort of catch if you disclosed your inventory number like what was it up year-over-year, if you can just share that? Will Franklin : Yes. Inventory was up in North America about 9.6%, worldwide it was up 9%. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Will Franklin : You're welcome. Operator : Next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Good morning. Last quarter you noted that the stronger dollar impacted revenue by about $6.8 million negative and EBIT by $1.3 million. In this quarter those numbers were, I think you said $5.8 million to revenue and $1.5 million to EBIT. Do you expect foreign exchange \u2013 that foreign exchange headwind to continue to ease or should we be expecting \u2013 should we be modeling in kind of continued headwind for 2016? Will Franklin : We don\u2019t have any information that the market doesn't have, so I would suggest to \u2013 I would speak with commodities or foreign currency expert in that respect. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. Thanks. Second question, is the year-over-year benefit from the roll off of the QCSA integration cost now complete or is there more that you expect in the coming quarters? Will Franklin : No, it's done. They are completely absorbed. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. And one more quick one. At this point we understand that it's still very early to determine what the ultimate impact of the VW controversy would be in the industry. Impacted vehicles have to be sent to salvage auctions, so I'd imagine that would be a tailwind, but if they get retrofitted and there is cascading impact on residual values that could be a headwind for ASPs. Do you have any approximate estimate of what percentage of vehicles that come through your auctions are VWs? Jay Adair : No, not off the top of my head. Elizabeth Suzuki : Thank you. Jay Adair : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong with C. L. King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up on G&A. Were there any non-recurring items within that, that might have kept us down during the fourth quarter or anything that might have been pushed out into the new fiscal year? Will Franklin : No. There really weren't. I mean there's always one-times. That just \u2013 when you have a Company of this size you have things that are unusual in every period, but there's nothing that's material that we'd call out this quarter. We do a pretty good job of calling out those things that are material just so you can do your modeling. Bill Armstrong : Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's it really all I had. Thank you. Jay Adair : Thanks, Bill. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning, guys. Will Franklin : Good morning. Gary Prestopino : Hey, Jay, you basically said at the beginning of the call that we're going to have some new markets and new products Q1 and Q3 of this year. I know enough not to ask you what those new products would be because you're not going tell us anyway, but in terms of new markets are you looking to go into new regions of the world where you aren't right now or countries that are tangential to where you in Europe and Middle East? Jay Adair : I think I resemble that remark that you've just made, but we are going to be looking at expanding in existing markets that we're in and we are anticipating based on current \u2013 what we can currently see in terms of volumes coming in the U.S. we're anticipating having significant - a good year in terms of that. So, some of the new products I talked about our customers are aware of and they are waiting for them and we'll be releasing in this year and some of them are going to allow us to expand further in some of our existing international footprint. So that's really what I was referring to. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then \u2013 and I think one of the questions was asked, but I didn\u2019t quite get it. Did you say your international revenue was about 22% this quarter versus 29% last year's fourth quarter? Will Franklin : No. International revenue is less than 2% of our total revenue, excluding U.K., excluding Canada, so you\u2019d be looking at the emerging side of our international strategy it\u2019s less than 2% of our revenue. Gary Prestopino : What I\u2019m getting at is what's your total international revenue as a percentage of sales, that's what I'm\u2026? Jay Adair : And the numbers Will was giving out was international buying. That was the buyers what percent of the value of the cars that we sell to international buyers. Will Franklin : Yes. I\u2019m sorry. Jay Adair : I believe that's what he's referring to, down from 29-ish to 21-ish. Will Franklin : Yes. Gary Prestopino : Right. But in terms of your \u2013 the percentage that's total international on this quarter, do you have that handy? Will Franklin : That's what I gave that was 21\u2026 Gary Prestopino : Okay, 21, okay, that's fine. That's what I'm trying to get at. And then if you look at that, how does that break down between vehicle sales and service. At one time majority of that was vehicle sales because it was UK, but has that shifted more as a percentage into service. Can you give us a break down there? Will Franklin : Yes. So just to be clear that the number I gave you were the North American units sold to non-North American buyers and those are almost exclusively agency cars. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Okay. Jay Adair : To be clear, you are not giving him a percentage -- our international revenues as a percentage of the company. I think he might have thought that, that's why I was\u2026. Gary Prestopino : Right. I'll follow-up with your guys there after the call, but anyway in terms of the tax rate going forward, Will what you would use as tax rate for next year? Will Franklin : You should probably be 35.5%, 36% Gary Prestopino : 35.5%, 36%. Okay, thank you very much. Will Franklin : You\u2019re welcome. Jay Adair : Thank you, Gary. Operator : At this time we have no further questions. Speakers, are there any closing remarks? Jay Adair : Thank you, Katie. And thank you everyone for attending the fourth quarter call and fiscal 2015. We look forward to reporting in the first quarter. Good bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Franklin - EVP and CFO Analysts : Robert Labick - CJS Securities Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Healy - Northcoast Research Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Ben Bienvenu - Stephens Craig Kennison - Robert W. Baird Operator : We now have all of our speakers in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Adair. Sir, you may begin. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Josh. Good morning everyone and again welcome to the first quarter call for 2016. I'm going to transfer it to Will first who will go over the financials, and then I'll have some closing remarks, and we'll open it up for questions. So with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. William E. Franklin: Thank you, Jay. Before we begin our comments, I would like to remind everyone on the call that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the risk factors contained in our most recent 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings. Also, this morning Copart filed a Schedule TO Offer to Purchase and certain other documents with SEC relating to a tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of common stock. These documents are available at the SEC Web-site. Copart is also mailing the Offer to Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and related documents to all shareholders. We do not intend to respond to questions concerning the terms and conditions with the tender offer on this call. The offer is made solely pursuant to the Offer to Purchase as may be amended from time to time, the associated Letter of Transmittal and the related documents. We encourage shareholders to review them carefully. With that, I'll begin with a few brief comments on the financial results for our first quarter. Total revenue remained relatively flat declining by $1.5 million or 53 basis points, as the increased volume was offset by reduced ASPs and consequently reduced revenue per car. ASPs were driven lower by the continuing decline in scrap metal pricing, which we believe to be highly correlated to junk and dismantler buyer behavior. The index for crushed car bodies in North America declined by over 48% year-over-year. We believe the ASPs were also negatively impacted by the stronger dollar as a significant portion of our North American sales are to international buyers and the stronger dollar continued to inhibit their auction participation. Purchased car revenue declined by $5.9 million or 13.5%. The decline resulted from the reduced ASPs, a change in mix and the negative impact of FX. In the current quarter, a higher percentage of purchased cars came from our direct purchase program which has a lower ASP than cars purchased from insurance companies. In our direct purchase program, we buy and sell cars for our own account. Service revenue increased by $4.4 million or 1.8%, as the increase in agency car volume was offset by a reduction in revenue per car. The decline in the revenue per car was tied to the lower ASPs. Yard operation expense increased by $5.4 million and was driven almost completely by volume as the average cost to process each car remained relatively flat. General and administrative cost declined by $5.6 million. The reduction came primarily from the rationalization of technology resources and the beneficial impact of FX. On an overall basis, the change in FX reduced revenues by $4.6 million and EBIT by approximately $0.9 million. During the quarter, we expended $19.2 million to accommodate the growth in accounts receivable and inventory, $20.2 million for yard expansion, equipment and technology, and $21.1 million in marketable securities. We exited the quarter with $473 million in cash and $226.7 million in total bank and private placement debt. That concludes my brief comments. Now I'll turn the call back over to our CEO, Jay Adair, to conclude comments on the quarter before we turn it over to Q&A. Jay? Jayson Adair : Thank you, Will. Again, good morning, everyone. First I'd like to talk about inventory. In the quarter, inventory in North America increased 14.4%. Looking at sales for the quarter, as Will mentioned, we saw a decline in ASPs due to strong dollar and also due to the low value of scrap at this time, and that revenue was offset because of sales increase of 5.1% in the quarter for North America. Looking at cycle times, because we often talk about inventory increases and the impact that they will have in subsequent quarters, typically in the next quarter, we want to talk about cycle time that was flat for the quarter, that was zero. So we don't see the increase in inventory associated with cycle time expanding but rather just through additional volume coming in. And then finally, as Will mentioned, international sales are down because of the strong dollar situation. A year ago in North America we were approximately 21%, and today we are just a tad below 20% on international sales. These are vehicles that are sold in North America and exported to countries outside the U.S. With that, I'd like to now turn it over to Josh and we'll open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick from CJS Securities. Robert Labick : I wanted to start off, first question, you had one other announcement last night as well. You announced a new Senior Vice President and CFO to come on early next year. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about his background. We obviously read the release and stuff, but any more color around that, and additionally talk a little bit about Will's new role and the growth opportunities in the U.S. that are likely to come with that? Jayson Adair : Sure. Jeff is a great guy. We've known him for a couple of years here in Dallas. He has been with FleetPride. FleetPride is owned by TPG. Prior to that, he was with TPG in a corporate role. And we have been talking to him for a while about a CFO position. Will started the EVP or took over the EVP role approximately 18 months ago, and the biggest improvement that he has made that you can clearly see is the reduction in G&A. So that has been a big push to have a focus on measuring output and reducing expenses where we felt we weren't getting a return. And you've seen that. We talked about that a year ago, we felt very confident a year ago that we were going to be able to see those types of results and Will executed on that in the last year. At the same time, he's been carrying the CFO title but we've been having a lot of that work done by Vik Bhatia on our team. And that wasn't the intent for Vik to do that but we wanted to make sure that Will was focused on the G&A reductions and other G&A performance pieces that we have got, areas that we measure and areas that we focus on. So Jeff will start in January and we brought him on as CFO based on his experience previously and our knowledge of him. So we are looking forward to having him on the team. Robert Labick : Great, that was helpful color. I appreciate that. And then into the quarter, I guess last quarter you did an excellent job and the cost to process a car was down materially, and you were able to hold it flat again after \u2013 previously there's been a number of quarters where it had been going up. Can you talk a little bit about expected trends in cost to process a car and what you're doing maybe differently now to flatten that or bring it down slightly? Jayson Adair : Part of it has been execution and the team's ability to focus on cost, part of it has been the benefit of fuel, and fuel has dropped significantly year-over-year and that's helped us control transportation cost. Part of our cost going up, if you recall, was related to Sandy and then it was related to an acquisition, barge acquisition we made, QCSA. And there was a whole process we had to go through to eliminate implicative costs and to try to reduce subhaul expense that had shot up through Sandy. So there were a couple of years of having costs that were increased because of those two factors, and then we also moved the Company from California to Dallas. So I feel strongly at this point we're at a normalized run rate. I don't see any reason at this point why fuel is going to skyrocket back up. I think that's pretty much understood throughout the industry. So I think we'll be able to maintain our current cost per car, and the only thing that would increase that a little bit is that we are looking at adding some additional facilities in the U.S. in the next year because of volumes that are up, and as we add stores, they have a cost, they increase the cost in the beginning and as we fill the stores with cars and start to sell those cars off, then it reduces the cost. But for the most part, I don't think we're going to see a real big increase in our operating costs at the yard, Bob. Robert Labick : Okay, great. And then last one and I'll get back in queue, in terms of the international expansion you've kind of given us updates on a quarterly basis. Just wondering how things are going in the key markets you're focused on and when we might hear more. Jayson Adair : We're happy with what we're seeing right now in terms of our results both in the U.K. and in the rest of the world. U.K. is obviously the vast majority of the international. U.K. is a much more mature market as opposed to the other markets that we're doing business in. We will be in a far better place to report on some of the results towards the end of this fiscal year. For now, I don't think I can add a lot more color than we added in the last quarterly call, but as we approach the end of the year, we should have some results and some color that we can give you on how we're doing internationally. Robert Labick : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Can you break out how volume, price and mix trended in the quarter in terms of year-over-year change for each, and what was the average age of vehicles sold in the quarter and how is that compared to this time last year? William E. Franklin: I think we addressed that directionally. The volume was up, and Jay gave the statistics on that. ASP is down, we didn't give an exact percentage to that, and I think we'll just leave it at that. ASPs were down. ASPs were down, so that drives revenue down. And the last question? Jayson Adair : Inventory was up. William E. Franklin: And inventory was up. Jayson Adair : And I guess about mix, 80-20. William E. Franklin: Yes, between insurance and non-insurance. In North America we're slightly under 20% in non-insurance, and that's basically because of the significant growth we have on the insurance side. In terms of total units, it's remained relatively flat. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, thanks. And do you have data on the average age of vehicles that were sold in the quarter? William E. Franklin: No, I'm sorry, I don't. Jayson Adair : It's going to be not too far from where it was the prior quarters, which is about 11.5, give or take. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, so no material change there. Jayson Adair : That's not exact. It's going to be within a few tens. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. And are you seeing any market share shifts or any market share being taken by smaller independent companies getting new insurance contracts or any other of the major seeking some share by reducing pricing or fees? Jayson Adair : No. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to ask a little bit about the U.K. market, [on the] [ph] starting to this year, you're a big competitor here in the U.S. [and earning] [ph] in that market, and was curious to know if you've seen anything change in that marketplace, if you are watching anything more closely than you have in the past and any sort of feel you could give for how that landscape is evolving? Jayson Adair : No, I'm happy to do that. United Kingdom, inventory was up 14.5%, so a little bit more than North America. Sales in the U.K. were up 5.6%, so a little more than the U.S. as well. So from an international standpoint, it's taken about the same trend. They are off a couple of points from or a little over 1 point from what used to sell internationally in that market. So it is doing well and I've really got nothing negative to report from the U.K. They are doing very well. John Healy : Got you. And I wanted to ask kind of more of a comparison issue. If you look over the last few quarters, your volume numbers have been healthy but maybe not quite as healthy as what's going on with the insurance auto auctions, and I was wondering if you guys could help us understand kind of the difference in the growth rate. I don't know if it's associated maybe with the market share amongst the insurance customers you have or if it has to do with maybe your charity business, but any color that you could give us to help us understand having the difference in growth rates there? Jayson Adair : I really can't. I can't talk to my competitor. I can just tell you that from our perspective to grow 5% year-over-year when you are our size is a big growth rate, to have an inventory build of almost 15% is a big number. So I really can't talk to what they are doing and how they're doing it. I can really just answer any questions you have about Copart. John Healy : Sure. I was just curious your thoughts along the lines from a share standpoint, have there been any changes in kind of the makeup of your customer base, are you seeing certain insurance companies grow at a faster rate maybe than others? I mean is there anything that you see that would maybe explain the behaviour change? Jayson Adair : Yes, we've had a recent market share gain, but it's really, that's not going to show up until probably the third and fourth quarter of the year. You have to start bringing the vehicles in and building inventory and then sell the vehicles off. So in the past year we've had some market share gains, we've seen the industry expand because of the age of vehicles, but the numbers \u2013 we have reported the numbers historically on the quarters, and so I won't try to restate them all. I mean the numbers are out there. John Healy : Got you. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Jay, did you guys give the total volume growth in the quarter? I think you gave 5.1% increase in North America, but did you give the total volume growth? Jayson Adair : No, I didn't. I can give you total volume for the \u2013 globally, for the U.K., for North America, the whole Company was 4.9%. Gary Prestopino : Okay, that's fine, thanks. And then in terms of your line of credit or your debt or whatever, what rate are you currently paying now on that debt or the line if you need to borrow? William E. Franklin: We're paying on the fixed fee we have a blended rate that's about $400 million of about 4.22%. On our Term Loan A we're at about a little over 2% and the amount of that is $225 million at this point. Gary Prestopino : Okay, good. And then just a couple of other things. In your proxy, you guys put forth something where you're trying to increase the shares outstanding from 180 million to 400 million, but yet you've just announced, maybe in an announcement today, of the sell tender. What's the rationale for doing that, Jay? Jayson Adair : That's interesting. I wasn't expecting to be asked a question like that. Gary Prestopino : You know I want to get you with one question per quarter, right? Jayson Adair : I'm going to look to my attorney for a minute. I'll put you on hold one sec. I think the best answer I can give you, Gary, is that we have a limited number of shares currently and we could have asked for less shares in the proxy, and then we might have to come out later and ask for more shares again. So we asked for a number that we felt was sufficient that we wouldn't have to go back and ask for again. And as my attorney is sitting here telling me, the explanation is in the proxy and he would prefer that we go with that. So we just felt like we were asking for enough that we wouldn't have to go back and it gives us the flexibility for the future. Gary Prestopino : Okay, that's fine. And then lastly, it looks like year-over-year your gross margin on agency was down about 124 basis points. Was there anything in there that's driving that, was there something one time or was there some benefit last year that would not make the comparison apples to apples? William E. Franklin: No, it's simply a decline in revenue per car while our cost stayed the same. So our cost didn't really fluctuate, they've been fairly consistent over the last four, five quarters. They fluctuate less than 4% I would say. Gary Prestopino : So it's all really attributing to your decline in ASPs then? William E. Franklin: Yes, it's all decline in ASPs. And in fact last quarter, while we were flat on our cost to process each car, we also had the negative impact of Hurricane Joaquin which had a significant amount of cost, and we absorbed that and still maintained a flat cost basis to process the car. So we're pretty happy with the efficiency of our operation. Gary Prestopino : Thanks. Have a happy Thanksgiving both of you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens, Inc. Ben Bienvenu : So on the mobile front, you guys have had quite a bit of success there adding the Android platform last year. I think you cited on the last call that about 12.5% of vehicles sold are coming through the mobile platform. I'd be curious to know are we still in that ballpark how it's trending, and I assume as you add capabilities and buyers or sellers become aware of that process, that's skewed upward over time, but just your thoughts on that capability? Jayson Adair : I mean we talked about it in the shareholder letter as well. So if you want to look to that, in the annual report there is maybe a more current stab on how we're doing. We are extremely happy with that result. We didn't know \u2013 many of our buyers like to bid on 5 to 10 auctions up on one screen at one time. It's one of the benefits of our Virtual Bidding Third Generation platform. So as opposed to have them physically attend an auction and have the different cadence and speed of human beings that are running the auction, our auctions are all much easier to follow when you've got 10 auctions open at once. And we didn't know, candidly, how many people would go to a mobile platform. We didn't know if there's going to be a scenario where they are out at our yard, they are looking at the car, bidding on it, or they're going to be at Starbucks bidding on it. And so to be near 15% in penetration I would say has already exceeded what we thought it would do. I don't know if it will end up at a fifth of our units selling over mobile or if it will stay where it's at, but I can just tell you, from both the Android and from the Apple platforms, we're extremely happy with the results we have seen thus far. William E. Franklin: Let me add to that. There's other efforts. So we have I think a robust strategy to develop our mobile and not only through apps but through [mobily] [ph] optimizing our current Web-site, which we haven't done, which will make participation in our auctions through mobile devices much more attractive. Ben Bienvenu : That's great color, thanks. And then just one last one for me. You guys talked about adding incremental sites next year. Do you have a sense of what your site capacity utilization is today and are those additional sites going to be broad-based by geography, within North America or other specific regions? Jayson Adair : I don't have the actual percentage in front of me and I don't think it's relevant anyway. We've got some locations that have 50 acres of capacity and other locations that have 5 acres of capacity. So the reason we're constantly investing in expanding locations, we rarely talk about how many locations we've expanded in the year, and this year we're going to actually have to add additional locations in markets and that's just because we've seen a consistent growth in inventory since Sandy. So since 2012, there's been a year-over-year increase in inventories, and yes, we do sell that inventory off in the third quarter, but it has continued to grow year-over-year. And so we're at a point now where we not only are we going to be expanding yards this year like we have last year, but we're going to be adding a number of locations, and we'll talk about that in the year. I would guess it's in the half-a-dozen to a dozen locations that we'll be adding. And as we bring those locations online, we'll announce it so that everyone is aware of it. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great, thanks. Best of luck, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Craig Kennison : Thanks for taking my questions as well. Many have been addressed. But, Jay, I think you hinted at this, but was there any important RFP activity in the quarter that could affect your share down the road? Jayson Adair : We did have a win in the quarter, but that's not uncommon for us to have a win or multiple wins in a particular quarter. So we did have a win and that volume is \u2013 some of that volume is coming on now and some of that volume will be coming on in the subsequent, in Q2 and Q3, and we'll be selling that inventory off Q3 and Q4. We should be normalized I would think by the end of the fiscal year. Craig Kennison : In the past, you've had similar wins where you have gained essentially exclusivity with a big insurance company. Is this that flavor or is something less significant? Jayson Adair : I mean it's a top five carrier and it is an exclusive long-term agreement. So, yes, it's of that flavor. Craig Kennison : And I'm guessing you already had significant share with that top five insurer? Jayson Adair : Yes, we had a significant amount of their volume and now we'll be going 100%. Craig Kennison : And then just a final follow-up on that, Will, if my notes are right, sometimes these big insurance wins can be dilutive upfront until you get all the volume you expect to get over time. Is there any modelling nuance to this deal that we should be aware of? William E. Franklin: No, I don't think so. I think this new volume will blend in very efficiently with our current capacity. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And finally, not sure if you want to address this or not, but I'm curious what the attraction is of a Dutch tender offer versus other buyback alternatives? Jayson Adair : That's again another question I wasn't expecting. So I'll just say\u2026 William E. Franklin: We can't answer that. Jayson Adair : Yes, we can't comment on it because it's the tender. William E. Franklin: Look to the documents for any information you need for the tender. Craig Kennison : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Adair for closing remarks. Jayson Adair : All right, thanks, Josh. Thank you everybody for attending the first quarter call. We look forward to reporting the second Q next year and we want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving, and we'll see you then. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Adair. Sir, you may begin. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Call For Copart. On the call with me this morning is Jeff Liaw, our CFO, and Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. We're going to ahead and start with Jeff. He'll be passing it to Will. And then, we will open it up for questions. So, if you have a specific question that is for one us, you can call us up by name. It'd be great. With that, I'll pass it to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the Safe Harbor. Our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the risk factors contained in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. With that, I'll provide brief comments on our second quarter financial results. And I'll start first with the postmortem on the Dutch Auction we completed at the end of last year. We completed an acquisition of 8.3 million shares on December 30 at $39 per share for a total purchase consideration of approximately $325 million. Between the Dutch Auction in December as well as our purchase of shares in July, we ultimately purchased 14.8 million shares over the past 12 months, representing 11.7% of our shares outstanding. I'll shift gears now to the second quarter. I'll talk first about the income statement and then also the balance sheet as well. Our revenue was up $23.4 million year-over-year, reflecting 8.5% growth. This was driven largely by substantial unit growth, for example, 13.2% unit growth in North America, offset by softer ASPs and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. I'll describe both of those phenomenon in a little greater detail. Unit growth was driven largely by strong industry demand trends as well as our growth in non-insurance channels. But first, for example, within the insurance segment, we observed unit growth year-over-year in all of our top 10 sellers. The root causes of these volume increases are the same factors we've described in the prior calls, vehicle age and salvage rates, which Will will elaborate on later today, as well as an increase in miles driven. With continued low gasoline prices we have observed a increasing vehicle miles according to U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Miles driven grew even over the course of 2015. I'll also note here that other participants in our industry broadly including, for example, insurance carriers, have cited in their own earnings releases and presentations the trend of increased accident frequency and severity caused by low fuel prices, miles driven and distracted driving. With the expectation these trends will continue, we are observing similar phenomenon in our own business. On the question of ASPs, they have declined year-over-year due to several factors. First, low scrap values, according to American Recyclers Crushed Auto Body Index, January scrap values are at five-year low at approximately 68% below their post-recession peak in September 2011. We've talked previously about the strength of the U.S. dollar affecting our international buyers' purchasing power. For currencies like the euro and the Mexican peso, the USD is near its 10-year high. International buyers purchase approximately 20% of the units we sell in our North American auctions and generally purchase somewhat higher than average value cars. Lastly, ASPs have been affected by mix shift. We have continued to penetrate non-insurance categories which can affect our overall averages. Auto macroeconomic factors like metals pricing and currency are of course difficult to predict. Our own recent data does indicate a stabilization in ASPs. Shifting gears to speak briefly about currency, the detrimental revenue of effective exchange rate changes represented approximately $3.5 million in revenue effect for the quarter versus the prior year. Purchased car revenue grew slightly by $1.5 million, or 4% year-over-year, principally a growth in non-insurance units as described previously. Our service revenue was up $21.9 million, or 9.2%, a reflection of the same unit growth described a moment ago. Our yard operations expenses increased by $12 million, also a reflection of addressing the higher unit volumes through our system. Our general and administrative costs declined by $2.5 million year-over-year due principally to efficiencies in our spending on technology. As we've indicated in prior quarters, we do expect modest increases in G&A spending over time to accommodate both domestic and international growth. We are, as always, focused on the efficiency of our spending and driving the appropriate returns from it. Lastly, other income of $4.4 million was driven principally by gains on currency translation. Shifting gears to the balance sheet, quarter-over-quarter, we observed substantial investments in \u2013 or we made a substantial investment in working capital; specifically, almost $50 million, or thereabouts, in accounts receivable and inventory, a reflection of growing demand as inventory year-over-year was up 16.9% worldwide. Capital expenditures of almost $58 million for the quarter were driven largely by land acquisitions, land developments and lease buyouts. Those three factors are cumulatively 85%, or thereabouts, of our CapEx for the quarter to enable us to meet this rising unit demand, with the balance of the expenditures on software development and other maintenance CapEx. Will will provide more color on some of these investments in his commentary. Lastly, we completed the quarter with $141 million in cash and more than $225 million in available funds on our credit facility as we enter the third quarter. With that, let me hand it off to Will Franklin. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Thank you, Jeff. I'm going to provide a little more color on our performance during the quarter, as well as what we're seeing in the industry. First off, let me say how pleased we are with the results of our second quarter. The 8.5% growth in our revenue, as Jeff said, resulted primarily from growth in volume in both North America and the UK. In North America, beginning in the second half of our fiscal 2014, we began to see what we believe to be an increase in salvage frequency. By salvage frequency, we mean the rate at which cars involved in accidents are deemed economic loss and totaled as opposed to being repaired. We believe this trend is continuing, yet not accelerating. The trend is driven by several factors, the most important of which are the combination of rising repair cost and the increase in the average age of cars on the road. Growth in repair costs, we believe, has resulted from industry consolidation as more independent repair shops are being purchased by MSOs and, probably more importantly, the greater complexity of new cars from exotic and light-weight materials, complex construction sensors, cameras, and other electronics, all of which demand that shops employ new equipment, tools, and training as well as requiring more replacement parts per repair. Concurrent with this rise in repair cost, the average age of cars on the road has grown. At the end of 2015, the average age was 11.5 years, and it is expected to increase going forward. In addition to the growth in salvage frequency, we're now seeing an increase in accident frequency as lower fuel prices and higher employment trends are leading to an increase not only in the miles driven, but also the average speed of travel leading to more, and more severe, accidents. We also see this trend continuing. In North America, in addition to the growth in insurance volume, we've also seen growth in our non-insurance market. This growth was led by increases in charity and donation cars, broker cars, and cars from municipalities. In fact, non-insurance volume grew at a faster pace than insurance volume, representing 19.9% of total North American volume as compared to 19.4% in the same quarter last year. In North America, sales volume grew by 13.2% and inventory was up by 16.7%. To accommodate this significant increase in volume as well as the anticipated future increase, our operations and land teams have been extremely successful in obtaining new capacity. Some locations that have been historically difficult to address, we've been able to obtain facilities. In the next 12 months, we expect to open 15 new yards including a 22-acre facility in a prime Southern California location, addressing a capacity need that has existed for over 20 years. In addition to the new yards, we're actively working on the expansion of 18 existing facilities. Now to the UK in which we saw a similar growth in volume increasing by 10.5%. The insurance volume grew to increases in both market size and market share. However, almost half of the total growth in volume came from non-insurance sellers as the whole car dealer and the whole car direct purchase programs grew in both volume and profitability. In total, our worldwide volume grew by 12.9% and our worldwide inventory grew by 16.9%. We're also extremely pleased at our efforts to control both our operating cost and our general and administrative cost. We've been focused on spending our dollars efficiently with an eye on returns. In the last five quarters, our consolidated G&A spend has averaged $30.1 million. In the five quarters prior to that period, our average quarterly G&A spend was $36.8 million. In addition, in the last 10 quarters, we have been successful in controlling our operating cost in a very challenging environment, all leading to the operational leverage that generates relative growth in margin and EBIT that outpaces our growth in revenue. That concludes my brief comments. Jennifer, now we'll turn the control of the call back over to you for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Good morning and congratulations on a very nice quarter. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Bob. Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Thank you. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: I wanted to start, last quarter on the conference call, you mentioned a larger-than-normal RFP wins or some market share in that regard. When do those \u2013 are those volumes flowing through in this current quarter or are they coming into your yards and impacting expenses in this quarter? Could you just give us a sense of how that's going to impact the P&L and if it had any impact on this quarter? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Sure. Bob, it really didn't have much impact at all this quarter. That contract, we began collecting those cars deep into December. And that really didn't allow for enough time for those cars to cycle through to the auction process. So, we anticipate those to have an impact next quarter. They really had very little impact in the current quarter. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Bob, I'll just add to that. To your point, when Will says next quarter, that's Q3. And to your point, the cost associated with receiving those cars was in Q2. So there was cost associated with building the inventory. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And, you've accelerated the yard opening. I think last quarter, you mentioned 6 to 12 locations. You said up to 15 now in the next 12 months, and you have those locked in? Can you give us a sense of the CapEx you'll be spending over the next year? Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Bob, thanks for the question. I think the \u2013 we expect the expenditures to be substantial forecasting more precisely difficult in the realm of land and land development spending is episodic, the exact timing it's tough to pin down. So we don't have a forecasted number. We'd broadly say approximately $100 million over the next 12 months. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Let me just add to that, that's for these particular projects. There is always other needs that come up but addressing just the ones we identified in this call, that's the figure. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Got it. Right. You've obviously just spent a bunch in the last quarter as well as you highlighted. Okay. And then just from your website, I noticed that your increase in the frequency of auctions in some of your Canadian yards as well, is that industry growth share wins and do you need more yards up there as well? Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Yeah. Actually that's in response to a market win in that location and we see volume growing in Canada as well. So, yes, I would assume that over the course of time maybe not 12 months but over the next year or two, we'll need more facilities in Canada. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Last one from me. I'll turn back in queue. I promise. And then you had your first auction in India, I think in October and you've opened the second location since then as well. Could you just give us a sense of what you've learned from the experience of opening up in India and how that will help you in other international market, are rollouts coming? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Sure. So just to be clear, we have one permanent location that's North of Delhi. The location in Chennai is in response to some floods are taking place in that region and we have yet to decide whether that will be a permanent location or not. As you said, we're just entering that market and entering in any far market requires a learning curve, and not just cultural, but technically and processes. And so we're using these initial auctions to become familiar with how to best address that market. We don't talk about it in much detail, because it's not a major contributor at this point. Although, we think our international strategy will generate meaningful growth going forward, at the current time, it's not. And so, we just \u2013 we don't really focus on it during these calls. Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen. The 15 yards that you're planning to open over the next 12 months, are these still in markets where you don't have a presence, or is it more maybe bulking up your presence within markets? Or maybe just give us a little color on how you're looking at this expansion. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Go ahead. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Yeah. Bill, we really have a fairly complete network. Most of these yards that we're looking at are to address capacity needs in those areas. But a byproduct of that, as always, we become more efficient on our self hauling. When you have more locations, you tend to reduce the average haul distance. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Right. Okay. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : I can't think of any of these that we've targeted a market we don't currently address. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Right. That's \u2013 I thought you had a pretty comprehensive coverage. And as far as G&A, it was pretty low in the quarter. Were there any non-recurring items? And as we look forward, what sort of run rate ought we be sort of expecting going forward? Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Hi, Bill. This is Jeff speaking. I think every quarter we'll encounter blips in both directions. I think if you take our fiscal year so far, in combination with Q1 and Q2, I think that's reasonably representative of our starting point. We do provide the guidance that with these elevated volumes, with international expansion, we do expect modest increases over time. So, I think if you take Q1 and Q2 as a starting point, that's a reasonable base line. William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Great. Understood. Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, just on the pricing environment, can you maybe remind us of how much of the gross price of your vehicles you auction is tied to scrap metal prices versus used car prices versus strength of the dollar? And then, as the gross price of those vehicles changes, how does that impact your ASP? I know you charge a percentage of the transaction price, but I think there's another portion maybe that's fixed. And is there any room in the market to respond if transaction prices fell by, for example, increasing the percentage rate that you charge? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : So, let me \u2013 there are several questions there. Let me start with the ones I can remember. The scrap metal pricing affects the majority of the cars that we sell. It affects cars that are recycled, cars that are crushed and cars that are dismantled. Even once the valuable parts are harvested, the carcass needs to be recycled. And so, I would say that it has a meaningful impact on our total auction volume. What was the \u2013 give me the second question. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So as the transaction price \u2013 so, for example, the scrap metal prices are being pressured here. Can you offset that to maintain average selling price for Copart by increasing percentage rate, for example? Is the market \u2013 can it bear that? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : No. We really don't discuss specific pricing strategies on the call. I will tell you that with the scarcity of land, we're very sensitive to the nature of the cars that we process and we've become more selective in that area. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just last question, Will, did I hear you say that half of the increase in volume this quarter stemmed from non-insurance cars? Is that right? Because I think that that's a pretty small portion, so it must be increasing rapidly. What's the driver of that? And can you give us an update, where do you stand with regard to whole cars versus \u2013 whole cars and non-insurance salvage cars? What percentage of the vehicles that you auction are comprised of those two types of vehicles? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Sure. That (20:32) was specific to the UK. So it was actually about 45% of the volume growth in the UK was from non-insurance cars. In the U.S., it's far less. My point in the United States was that the growth rate in non-insurance cars, while it represents just slightly less than 20% of our total volume, it's faster than our growth rate in our insurance volume; at least, it was year-over-year. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Congrats. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : You're welcome. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Will, starting with you, could you give us an idea for the key drivers to your SG&A cuts? And maybe the sustainability of the new lower SG&A? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Yeah. I think we've become more efficient in our technology spend will be the primary driver there. I would say that's the primary, but it's not the sole, so we've actually gone through every function within our G&A to make sure that it produces value. And we've made changes, and it's not necessarily reflected in head count. It's reflected in programs and consultants and initiatives that don't lead to new cars. That's kind of like our goal standard for should we spend the dollar? And the answer is, if it's going give us more cars then we tend to lean towards spending it. If the answer is that it doesn't, then we have to question again why we never want to spend that dollar. And that's kind of a process and a filter that we've employed in analyzing all of our costs in G&A. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): If you look \u2013 pardon me. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I really can't be more specific than that because it's more of a cultural philosophy that we now have. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): If you look at it on a per car basis, do you feel like there's very little you can take out from here in terms of your cost to process the vehicle? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Look, if you're talking about operating cost as opposed to G&A... Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : We benefit from a fixed cost model, so the most important measurement for us is how many cars we process per yard. That being said, we have pressures in the other direction. So, one of our measure is not to measure cost of processing every car is the sub-haul cost. And while we've benefited from the lower fuel prices, the higher demand has actually offset that benefit where we're paying slightly more for our self-hauling cost. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And then, Jay, if you could give us an update on the non-insurance side. What are you doing to drive volume there and to what extent can you leverage your salvage resources to grow the business, and to what extent is that counterproductive if you have capacity constraints in some markets? A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the good news is the non-insurance business is a high turn business. So, it's got a little cycle time, taking up less capacity of our facilities. And these are, in many cases, as Will mentioned, a donation fleet, but also dealer business. So, the differentiator is really showing the results, the data, so it's \u2013 we've got a great sales team, and we then back them with the tools they need to go out and show the data to articulate the return that we're delivering at auction. So, right now, it's an interesting time because you've got this extremely strong dollar. I don't know. I haven't looked at the peso recently, but I think the last time I looked at it, it was MXN 17 or MXN 18, something like that to the dollar. The peso a year or two ago was closer to MXN 10. So we've got this extremely strong dollar right now, and yet we're still averaging above 20% international sales. So, it is down some, but it's still a meaningful number to the company. And that drives returns. So, if you can show potential clients the actual numbers, the actual results, the returns that we're getting, you will drive volume. And there's been a very successful push in that area both on \u2013 U.S. about non-insurance, but both on non-insurance and on insurance business. So, we've had a significant \u2013 we had a significant year in terms of gains through new business, but we've also been fortunate in the respect of having an industry that's growing right now. There's a lot of \u2013 we've talked in previous calls. There's a lot of natural hedges at Copart. So if the dollars were to weaken, ASPs would go up. Fuel prices typically would be higher in a weakened dollar state. So, we make more per car but we process less volume. Right now, it's the exact opposite of that. So, we're processing a lot more volume as a company, making less in a per unit basis but in absolute terms making more. So, yeah, things are good. Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a question on leverage, at the end of the quarter, it looked relatively high compared to historical levels given that you just completed the large tender offer. Do you have a target leverage ratio that you're aiming for and would you rebuild some cash before doing additional acquisitions or buybacks or is there some room to lever up a bit further? Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Thanks for the question, Elizabeth. This is Jeff speaking. As you noted, the cash balance declined substantially versus the prior quarter as we completed the Dutch Auction. We don't manage the business specifically to a target leverage ratio. I think we do expect to generate operating cash flow in the third quarter as we typically have done in terms of our seasonal performance. So, we won't necessarily govern how we think about investments in land and so forth as Will was describing a moment ago based on our balance sheet. We have $140 million of cash, more than $225 million in our revolver. So, that won't be a near-term or medium-term constraint on how we think about investing in new opportunities of that sort. Regarding, I think, your embedded question about share repurchases, that's not something we'll comment on in a call like this. We'll continually evaluate that in the quarters and years to come how we think about the \u2013 our balance sheet in the aggregate. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And given that you have operations in the UK, can you just talk about how much exposure you have to the British pound and if you have any way to hedge against that exposure, or what impact you think that might have on your next few quarters of operations? Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Sure. I'll start there, and then Will and Jay can jump in as well. So in terms of the standalone operations themselves in the UK, that the costs and the revenues are in British pounds, so we don't have any mismatch within the four walls of the operations in our UK business. In terms of the translation exposure, we do have a general inclination to take the pounds we generate and convert them to U.S. dollars for our own holdings' sake. We don't have a hedge in place today regarding the translation risk for the UK \u2013 for the pound in terms of revenue and earnings. So there is some volatility there. It can obviously work both ways. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So it's more translation risk and less actual (28:26) economic risk. Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Right. Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw - Chief Financial Officer & Senior VP-Finance: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : A question on the inventory build, you said you had added some inventory starting in December attached to this new insurance contract. How much of your inventory growth was that contract? Just trying to get a feeling for how much is going to flow through in the current quarter. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : I don't know. I haven't measured it. It's not a significant... A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Less than 10%. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Yeah, less than that. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, I think Will made a comment about the North American salvage frequency, and I think you said it was continuing and maybe accelerating. Is that something you're seeing in the current quarter or is that sort of a bigger picture comment? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : That's more of a bigger picture comment. But we are seeing it in the quarter. I mean, we've seen it for some time and the impact is, as you can see, in the increased volume. So, I mean, we've got both those influences working in the direction of sending more volume to us : accident frequency and salvage frequency. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, one final question. Sort of on the foreign exchange side, a year ago you saw a lot of your rapid strength in the U.S. dollar. It's gotten a little bit more stable relative to peers, although still high. Are you seeing foreign buyers showing more interest now that there's less foreign exchange shock? Even though their currency is worth less, are they participating more at the auction? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Yeah. Actually, on a sequential basis, we did see foreign participation up. So, I don't know if that's a result of recovering from shock or other influences, but we did see a sequential increase. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Your welcome. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll be taking our final questions. Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Matthew Gall - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is Matt Gall filling in for Gary. Thanks for taking my question. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Gall - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Most of the questions have been answered. I just wanted to touch on maybe some comments that Will provided. Just want to make sure I had the numbers correct. For the consolidated volumes in inventory, can you repeat what those percentages were as far as the increase? William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Yes. It was 12.9% on sales volume, and it was 16.9% on inventory volume. Matthew Gall - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. I was writing it down quickly. I just want to make sure I had that correctly. And then, again, most of the questions have been answered, maybe just something that you had mentioned, with salvage and accident frequencies both up and then kind of the emergence of collision avoidance technology equipped on vehicles over the coming years, maybe just what your thoughts would be as far as how collision avoidance might impact some of those frequencies. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : I think that over the course of time, it will have a negative impact on accident frequency and a positive impact on accident and salvage frequency. So, as I said, these cars are packed full of electronics and complex materials. And any time you have a car involved in an accident that has \u2013 we just heard that if you replace a window in a Mercedes Benz, you have to reset several sensors in that Mercedes Benz that you didn't have two or three years ago. So as the cost to repair goes up, and Jay talked about this. These are the natural hedges in our business. So, we think that, as expected, we'll have fewer accidents. We also think that those accidents result in a higher percentage of cars being towed. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: If I can add to that, you're also \u2013 Matt, you're also putting more vehicles on the existing infrastructure in the U.S. So, as we see population increase, more vehicles aging, the cost of those vehicles is lower. Access to vehicles goes up. More people drive, more people driving, more people on the road causes more accident. So, there's a number of moving parts here. We don't subscribe to the belief that vehicles are going to be self-driving, at least not in my future. I can't see how that's going to happen. That's too far out. As for a collision avoidance, for sure there's going to be more of that. But it's very analogous to anti-lock brakes in the 1980s. We saw anti-lock brakes installed in cars. At the same time anti-lock brakes went in, it reduced the number of accidents. They put airbags in cars. And when the airbags went in, they increased the total loss frequency. So, to Will's point, there's going to be a lot of additions to the vehicle that is causing the cost of repair to go up. It will be offsetting that collision avoidance. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : And Matt, let me make with one final comment. So, the outlook I gave was long term. If you looked at industry sources, I think that they are suggesting that at least through 2020, they expect a growth in accident frequency. Matthew Gall - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: All right. That's great color. Thanks for that. That's it for me. Congrats on the quarter, guys. William Franklin - EVP, US Operations and Shared Services : Thank you, Matt. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jay Adair. A. Jayson Adair - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jennifer. Again, thank you, everyone, for attending the call. We're really happy with the results. We look forward to reporting on the third quarter on the next call. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you, everyone. At this time, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect now.",

Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC John Healy - Northcoast Research Matthew Paige - Gabelli and Company Matthew Gall - Barrington Research Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 earnings call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call for Copart. With me today is Jeff Liaw, our Chief Financial Officer, Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. And I am going to turn it over to Jeff who will start things off, pass it to Will and then we will open it up for Q&A. With that I will turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks Jay. We will start with the Safe Harbor. Our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our views of trends in our business. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ substantially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. For a discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the risk factors contained in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. I will start with a brief financial overview before turning it over to Will. Starting with the income statements, our operating performance included revenue growth of a little over $50 million for the quarter year-over-year that represents 16.9% growth on unit sales growth of 15.6%. We did experience a detrimental revenue effective of approximately $3.7 million from currency effects due to quite strengthening of the USD year-over-year versus the British pound.  Our service revenue grew by $46.9 million or a little north of 18% that is greater than our purchased car sales growth of 3.2 million or 8% year-over-year. Within our insurance segments in particular, we experienced volume increases across virtually all of our major carriers. We heard the carriers themselves reference in their public discussions, references to heightened driving activity, increased accident rates, as well as elevated repair cost leading them to render total loss decisions more frequently.  That is the volume side of the equation. As we look to the ASP portion of our revenue base we have observed and talked previously about both scrap rates, currency rates, as well as the used car index. We had experienced in recent months a stabilization of scrap trends which had declined in the past year and changed. We are still down year-over-year for the third quarter in comparison to 2015, approximately 9% for scrap rates across car bodies according to American Recycler. But we are up sequentially, almost 14% relative to the second quarter alone.  We have noted the Manheim Used Car Index for the third quarter was also down year-over-year, a little less than 1.5% and also down versus the second quarter about the same amount. As a result our ASPs remain decreased relative to last year but they are up sequentially. Moving further down the P&L, our operating cost did grow by 11.7% year-over-year somewhat meaningfully less than our revenue growth which led to some leverage at the gross profit level as we grew GP by 23.7%.  Our general and administrative expenses were up $1.9 million year-over-year, a reflection of higher volume and business activity, up sequentially versus the second quarter, approximately flat versus the first quarter for us this year. As we have noted on prior calls we do expect absolute dollar G&A expenses to rise over time as our volume grows and the complexity of our business increases. The bottom line is our net income grew by 28.6% for the quarter while EPS was up 45.5%, enhanced by share buybacks in July of last year, December of last year, and March of this year which I will comment on little later in the call. Turning to the balance sheet, we generated cash flow with a reduction in accounts receivable. It declined sequentially as they do typically with the seasonal depletion of inventory, less so than in the third quarter of 2015 due to a growth in our physical inventory. Our capital expenditures of $66.1 million compared to $56 million and change in our prior quarter, again approximately 85% for land, developments, lease buyouts and the like, largely in investments in our growing capacity. Last two notes on the balance sheet, the first is that we purchased 2.9 million shares on the open market for 118 million or thereabouts at an average share price of $40.13, a continuation of our program or an extension of the program we completed in December of last year.  Over the past 12 months then we have purchased approximately 17.5 million shares or about 14% of our total shares outstanding. And the last note, we undertook a simple refinancing action. We restored our term loan to the original balance of $300 million that we had completed in December of 2014. We extended the duration to full five years and expanded our revolver by approximately $50 million. In effect we termed out the revolver balance that we had drawn leaving us with a fully undrawn revolver. We have reduced our interest rate slightly on both funded spreads and undrawn fees. With that I will turn it over to Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. I would like to add a little color on our business performance as well as the environment in which we operate. Once again we are very pleased with the results for our third quarter. The 16.9% growth in consolidated revenue was driven primarily from increased volume which grew by 15.6%. I will start first with some comments about our North America results in which volume grew by 16.4%.  First, we believe we are seeing a growth in overall size of the North America salvage market. Accident frequency was up driven by lower fuel prices and higher employment trends which is leading to increases to miles driven and average speed of travel and consequently to more frequent and more severe accidents. And we believe this trend will continue. At the same time we are also seeing growth in salvage frequency. By salvage frequency we mean the rate at which cars involved in accidents are deemed an economic loss and totaled as opposed to being repaired. We believe there are several reasons for this growth.  The first is the growth in repair costs, driven by industry consolidation as more independent repair shops are being purchased by MSOs. And more importantly, the greater complexity of new cars as they incorporate exotic and light-weight materials, extremely tight repair tolerances, sensors, cameras, and other electronics; all of which demand that shops employ new equipment, tools, and training, as well as require more replacement parts for repair.  The second is the increase in average age of the car parked which reached 11.5 years in 2015 and is expected to grow. As car age, their value declines making it less likely that they\u2019ll be repaired. And third is the increasing length of time policy holders must be without their cars during the repair process, whether as a result of the process itself or a longer queue time waiting to get into the collision shop. This increases not only the total cost to repair the car but also impacts the customer satisfaction metrics. Insurance companies are increasingly sensitive to the quality of the policy holders\u2019 claim experience.  In addition to the growth and the size of the overall salvage market in North America, we saw a growth in our market share as the impact of several recent contract wins for the most part were fully represented in this quarter\u2019s volume numbers. And finally we saw a 10.4% growth in volume from our non-insurance suppliers. This growth was led by increases in charity and donation cars as well as cars from dealers and brokers. Now I will turn to make a few comments about the UK in which we also saw a growth in volume increasing by 11.1%. In the UK insurance volume grew to increases in both market size and market share. In addition in the UK volume from non-insurance sellers grew by 23% as the dealer and direct-purchase programs grew in both volume and profitability. While we grew consolidated revenue by 16.9%, we grew our gross margin by 23.7% and our operating margin by 28.7%. Once again demonstrating the operational leverage endemic in our business model. Despite the additional costs associated with operating in CAT environments, primarily Houston, we've kept our cost to process each car remarkably consistent over the last seven quarters. As efficiencies derived from processing higher volumes have offset the natural increases in labor and [indiscernible] cost.  We also remain focused on controlling our G&A expenses. While G&A of $31.7 million for the quarter was up both year-over-year and sequentially, we remain well below the run rate of fiscal 2014 of $36.8 million for the quarter. The growth year-over-year and sequentially was driven primarily by increased cost on brand development, litigation [conferences] [ph], headcount and compensation.  And finally, to accommodate the volume growth that we have experienced and the future growth that we anticipate, last quarter we announced an initiative to open 15 new yards during the next 12 months. We are reporting that during the current quarter we acquired five yards, two of which were placed in service. We closed on those two yards, one in Wilmer, Texas and one in Temple, Texas in April; and currently they have approximately 4,600 and 1,800 cars on the ground respectively. That concludes my comments. Justin, at this time I will turn the call back over to you for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Majek : Good morning, this is actually Robert Majek filling in for Bob today. Jayson Adair : Good morning, Robert. Jeffrey Liaw : Hi, Robert. Robert Majek : Can you discuss the inventory growth in the quarter? Jeffrey Liaw : Sure. So our inventory for the quarter grew at approximately 20.7% year-over-year, that's a global number. As a reminder for folks who haven\u2019t followed us for a long time, when we talk about inventory this is physical assets at Copart as opposed to balance sheet inventory which is a different animal altogether. The growth of approximately 20.7%, if you isolate the effect of weather events that we experienced in Texas excluding the growth from that alone we still observe inventory growth of approximately 18% year-over-year. Robert Majek : That is helpful, thank you. And in previous calls you discussed a top five insurance FRP wins. Did we see the volume from that contract in the third quarter and was that the full impact or should there still be additional incremental volume in the fourth quarter? Jeffrey Liaw : No, I think we addressed that in our comments. We did -- we feel the volume is fully reflected, we don\u2019t see any future growth from those recent market wins. And I should mention it is just not one, there are several market wins that we have had over the last three or four quarters. Robert Majek : Appreciate it, I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks Rob. Jayson Adair : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Ben Bienvenu : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Jayson Adair : Good morning and thank you Ben. Ben Bienvenu : Just curious, on the gross margin front, you spoke to the leverage, the operating leverage inherent in the business. I will be curious, what cycle times looked like in the quarter given the really strong volume growth you called out and then maybe any other things that you might be doing to capture incremental efficiencies to drive that leverage? William Franklin : So our cycle times Ben were approximately the same as they were a year ago for the third quarter as well. So, that is not a major driver of the unit performance for the quarter. Jayson Adair : And let me add on what we are doing to become more efficient. We are really a very efficient company already. We are looking to technology to help us in the process and that's in a couple of areas. One is in the dispatch area, the other is the pickup cycle. And we anticipate rolling out these products to enhance these operations over the next three or four quarters. Jeffrey Liaw : And I will just add to that, DMV as well. So, as we process DMV in house as opposed to sending it to the state, we have seen improvement. And the final point I would make Ben is you really can't crunch the cycle times too much. I mean if you look historically over the last 20 years, they haven\u2019t changed enormously. There is a period of time from day loss, [indiscernible] loss to pick up to receiving title, to sending title estate, to selling the vehicle. And as Will pointed out and on the DMV that is about really all you can do to compress those times. So they are always going to run somewhere north of 60 days as an average. Ben Bienvenu : That is really helpful detail, thanks. And looking this year at FX and relative to last year when the dollar was quite strong and the presumable pressure that put on the foreign buyer appetite at auction, what are you seeing from foreign buyers this year year-to-date with the dollar being a little bit more subdued. Have you seen any trend shift there? Jayson Adair : Yes, we have. Actually, sequentially participation by our foreign buyers is down marginally, not a lot but it is down marginally and it is down year-over-year as well. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, and then one last one from me, when you look at your balance sheet, you have raised some debts with the tender offer, but leverage is still pretty modest. I was curious to get your comfort level on leverage and then what sort of capital deployment opportunities would you need to raise that comfort level, would you be willing to take on incremental debt to fund the repurchase or would you prefer to do that out of free cash flow? Jeffrey Liaw : We are comfortable with the amount of debt we have got right now. With respect to future debt we will analyze that at that time, so I think it would be premature to talk about what scenarios. We would have to know at that time what all the factors were to decide we wanted to do. I think the biggest point I might make on this question is the insiders control a large portion of this company. And so we will always be prudent in our analysis and in our thought process with respect to debt. Ben Bienvenu : Great, thanks and best of luck. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, great, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Ryan. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Ryan Brinkman : First question is just -\u2013 you mentioned, I think it was Will, that industry volumes are up in North America, [indiscernible] miles driven, etcetera, and I think we can see that. But are you able to say how much of your volume growth in the quarter is from industry tailwind as opposed to how much it reflects the market share gain including as a result of the new contract? William Franklin : No, those -\u2013 we could if we made some assumptions and because it would be based on assumptions we're just -\u2013 we're probably not going to share that on the call. I will tell you this though that the salvage has a very unique spot in this collision-repair ecosystem. And when you see an increase in overall volume of assets, it\u2019s much easier for us to increase capacity than it is for the repair shops to increase capacity. And it\u2019s not because it\u2019s difficult to build in the repair shops, but it\u2019s very difficult to train new technician and craftsmen to accommodate this higher demand. And consequently we're seeing a higher portion of these assets become -\u2013 so we believe a higher portion of these assets being salvaged as opposed to being repaired. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just on the impact of currency again, I mean, you just mentioned about the lower interest from overseas buyers in U.S. auctions, but what about the currency translation impact on your profits in the UK? How has that been impacted? And then could you comment at all on how the business there might be potentially impacted by Brexit? Jayson Adair : So I think the data we shared at the top was that we experienced a detrimental revenue effect of about $3.7 million in the translation from GBP back to USD and that\u2019s because year-over-year we've experienced relative U.S. dollar strengthening. So when you \u2013\u201ctrade the profits\u201d from the pound back into USD, you get fewer USD than you did a year ago. So that\u2019s the effect we've experienced there.  As for Brexit, I think we probably aren\u2019t well-positioned to speculate. I think there are experts who believe that the euro would then in turn suffer as a result. I think that\u2019s probably better left to other experts to speculate on. We don\u2019t foresee a meaningful effect on either our UK or U.S. business directly. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. And then just lastly, I think I heard you say that the non-insurance volumes are also rising maybe 10% in the U.S. Can you just remind us of the size, the materiality of this business relative to your overall business and then provide an update just in terms of what the volume drivers are that are causing the non-insurance cars also to increase in volume? Thanks. William Franklin : Sure. As a percentage of our total North America volume is actually drifted slightly below 20% and that\u2019s not because it hasn\u2019t grown, because it\u2019s grown nicely. It\u2019s just that our insurance business has grown so much faster. The drivers for our growth are primarily our returns. So therefore providing our suppliers favorable returns and that\u2019s attracting more business. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning. Jayson Adair : Good morning. Jeffrey Liaw : Morning. Bret Jordan : Trying to work around this market share question again. If we look at the inventory growth, and I think last quarter you commented that some of that farmers\u2019 volume began to show up in inventory at the end of the quarter. If we look at your inventory, up 20.7%, could you talk about maybe which of that is associated with new partners or how much of the growth was associated with new partners? William Franklin : Well, once again, in order to do that we would have to take the overall growth and a portion or part of that to change in the business environment, how much of that is simply market wins. Those are a 100% it\u2019s real easy to do that. And might -- just because that be based on some assumptions that we have to employ. We're probably not going to make that -\u2013 speculate on that just on the call. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess if we look regionally and some of the collision guys, specifically Boyd [ph] was talking about some of the northern markets seeing some softer collision repair trends this winter with the general lack of winter. Could you talk -\u2013 would the quarter have been meaningfully stronger or was that a real regional dispersion as far as strength or weakness in the salvage volumes? William Franklin : It\u2019s really hard to point to weather as a driver for our business, because we're nationwide. And when you include the UK we're worldwide. And when you might have increment weather in one region, you might have unseasonably good weather in other regions. So the only time we really point to weather in advance is when we have what we call a CAT. And we had three CATs last quarter in San Antonio, in Fort Worth, and in Houston. And we \u2013 I think we -\u2013 Jeff, addressed the impact of those CATs in his inventory numbers. We could tell you that on the sell side that we calculated a few hundred of those cars were actually represented in the sales volume. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I might have missed this, did you give any update on Germany? William Franklin : No, we didn\u2019t. Outside of North America and the UK that -\u2013 those businesses combined represented about 1.5% in revenue and really no EBIT, they\u2019re about breakeven. And so we have concluded that until they become a meaningful driver of our business in these directions, up or down, we're really not going to talk about their performance. That being said, we will say that we're extremely happy with our international strategy and we're also very happy with the recent execution towards that strategy. And hopefully we\u2019ll have some more comments in the next few quarters on the results. Bret Jordan : Yes, that\u2019s what I was getting at. I was under the impression maybe you're going to accelerate your investment in Germany. I didn\u2019t know if you had updates as to where we were in that? Jayson Adair : Bret, just to the question you opened with regarding inventory growth, I think Will noted how difficult analytically it is to isolate the different effects. I think it is accurate to say that strong majority of our inventory growth is not due to new accounts per se. That\u2019s it\u2019s more like-for-like growth across our end customer base. Bret Jordan : Alright, great. Thank you. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Bret. Operator : The next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question as it relates to expectations going forward. You're adding the 15 or so yards, you are adding capacity to a number of yards. And when I hear you talk about the growth prospects of the business, I hear you guys talking more about salvage frequency than just the number of collisions on the road actually increasing. Where do you guys think we're at and what are the insurance companies telling you we are at in terms of salvage frequency, the outlook for that maybe over the next three or four years? Jeffrey Liaw : I think we want to be clear on that, it\u2019s a combination of both. So we live in an environment right now where the \u2013 Will, started to mentioned or in his remarks mentioned, the technician, but the difficulty in hiring technicians today versus 10 years ago is the complexity of vehicles. So we live in a world where there are more accidents and then when those accidents occur, total loss frequency goes up. The likelihood of that vehicle becoming a total loss goes up. And much of that is driven. To me it\u2019s very analogous, 20 years ago when we saw air bags and antilock brakes go into cars. There will be offsets where one reduces the amount of accidents and there will be another offset where when there is an accident one increases the likelihood of total loss. So we're seeing that right now and we are opening up and expanding a number of locations in the next year because frankly we've got record capacities and we anticipate that, that will be the same a year from now that we\u2019ll be looking at another record inventory build with record sales. John Healy : Got you, and I wanted to ask about the CrashedToys business. Can we assume like you guys are putting a little bit more resources towards kind of marketing that business and maybe doing some things there? Can you kind of talk about what the plan is for CrashedToys and it almost even seems like that there is like a retail aspect of it that you guys are marketing? I was just hoping you could give us some more color on that. Jeffrey Liaw : Sure. So we bought the company in June of 2013, when we made an acquisition of Quad Cities and Desert View Auto Auctions, with that came CrashedToys. We have continued to run the company and understand the brand and what we've decided at this point is we want to build the brand. And so, we've opened a location in Dallas, Texas. The retail aspect that you talked -\u2013 it is a retail operation so that is accurate, but it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s an experience. And the retail side that we're really pushing for is to have folks come out, hang out, learn about what we do, and eventually become buyers. So it\u2019s very much an incubator of future buyers of product and it is a differentiator for us on the toy side. So just in the last quarter alone we sold the Porsche 918 for over 400 grand we sold the Denali for almost 200 grand and then we sold Harley Davidson's for $8000 and Hondas for $3000. So it\u2019s an across-the-board product line but it is everything related to toys and we're testing it right now at this location in Dallas and as we decide or put our strategy together we\u2019ll report on that in future quarters. John Healy : Great. Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Paige with Gabelli & Company. Matthew Paige : Good morning, thanks for taking my call. You had noted an increase in volume from dealers, is this a trend that you expect to continue as a large number of vehicles are expected to come off lease moving forward? Jayson Adair : I think we do. We've refined our processes, we're getting -\u2013 we're seeing higher yields. We've seen growth year-over-year and we see no reason for that trend not to continue. And the really attractive part of that is that these are the most profitable cars that we process. The cycle times are short, the ASP\u2019s are very high and we're beginning to build more tools to help us in this arena. And once again, we're starting to roll out and our IT department is doing a great job and start roll out a lot of product. And the tools that help in this arena are in the queue and we expect those to be available to us to use in the next three or four quarters. Matthew Paige : Got it, thank you. And then the last question for me is how do you view repurchases moving forward as well as the different repurchase tools available to you? In the past you\u2019ve done Dutch auctions as well as open market, so I'm just kind of curious how you think about it looking forward? William Franklin : Sure. And Matt, I think big picture is as Jay noted, capital allocation questions are ones we address on a regular basis as we consider organic uses of our cash for our business internally as well as other possibilities including debt pay down, share repurchases, and the like. So share repurchases over the long term will likely continue to be a tool or an arrow in our quiver. We don\u2019t comment or speculate precisely on when or how much we would do. As for the tools, the specific paths to share repurchases, whether they are tenders, Dutch tenders, open market purchases and the like; again, that\u2019s circumstantial. We evaluate given our own assessment of the pros and cons at the times of those decisions. Matthew Paige : Perfect, alright. Thank you, gentlemen and good luck for the next quarter. William Franklin : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Matthew Gall : Hi, good morning, this is Matthew Gall filling in for Gary. Just wanted a -\u2013 quick question, I think Will, you had mentioned based on salvage frequency being due certain factors such as increased miles, there have been higher repair costs. One thing that I think was -\u2013 I hadn\u2019t heard before was kind of the speed of travel, but if you could maybe just kind of expand upon kind of that dynamic? William Franklin : Sure. So of the increased miles driven, more of those miles are freeway, rural and freeway driving activity, which is at a higher rate of speed which leads to more severe accidents. Matthew Gall : Got you, okay, thank you. And then as far as the international buyers with FX impacts, is that kind of similar to what it has been in terms as far as purchases from North American auctions or is that down a little bit or kind of directionally in which -\u2013 where I think 20% of units purchased..? William Franklin : It sounds likely but if ever so slightly. I believe we are going from 21% to 20.3%. Matthew Gall : Okay. And then lastly as far as the ASPs have kind of started to stabilize, down year-over-year but up sequentially, is that consistent on the non-insurance side or kind of how do we look at that as far as the shift mix from where you\u2019ve been? William Franklin : Well, yes, when you look at the non-insurance you have to bucket them, because a charity car is completely different than a dealer car. And so we've seen growth in our ASPs for our dealer cars. As I mentioned previously, those are the most profitable cars that we process. And actually, we've actually seen growth in our ASPs for our charity cars and I can attribute that to a couple of factors, one of which is, because of the scarcity of our land we have been intentionally targeted certain customers for -- you know we would visit them to ensure that we are getting the type of cars that are appropriate for us. So, we have been very selective in those that we allow to use our land especially in the more precious areas like Southern California and New England area. And because we have been more restrictive on accepting the low end cars, we increased the ASP on an overall basis with the charity cars. Matthew Gall : Right, great, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. William Franklin : Thank you. Operator : I am currently showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Adair. Jayson Adair : Alright, thank you and we appreciate you making the time to listen to our call. We look forward to reporting on the fourth quarter in the new fiscal year. And that concludes our meeting, thanks. William Franklin : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the earnings call for the fourth quarter for Copart. With me in the room today is Jeff Liaw, our CFO; and Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. I am going to turn it over to Jeff and he will give an update on the financials, and then we will give you an update on the company and then we'll be happy to open it up for questions. With that, Jeff? Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks Jay. Good morning everyone. I will start with the Safe Harbor. Our remarks today will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws including without limitations, statements concerning management assumptions of factors affecting anticipated growth in our markets and in the number of cars we expect to process. These assumptions include factors such as trends in accident frequency and severity, driver behavior, and repair costs. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a discussion of the risks that could adversely affect the assumptions and trends we identify today, or that otherwise affect our business generally, please review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2016. Additional information will also be contained in our upcoming annual report on Form 10-K and in other SEC filings. Copart expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements or comments. A brief note as well on non-GAAP financial measures. Included in today's discussion are certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and certain tax benefits and foreign income tax credit limitations, related to accounting for stock option exercises. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent alternative financial measures under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the comprehensive view of Copart's operations in accordance with GAAP and should only be read in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. This information constitutes non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, Copart has presented herein, and will present in other information it publishes that contains these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. W believe the presentation of non-GAAP net income per diluted share included in this discussion in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures provides meaningful information for investors, analysts and management in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. And now for our financial results. We are pleased with the results for our quarter and for the full year. I\u2019ll comment briefly on income statement trends for the quarter and for the full year and then share a few observations regarding our balance sheet and cash flow statement as well. As those who have followed us for some time know, we do not typically provide non-GAAP measures, so this quarter's and this year's presentations of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS reflect unusual events this quarter and this year that were substantive enough to warrant this sort of communication. For the best representative snapshot of our business, I would recommend focusing on revenue, gross profit, and operating income measures though I will also walk you through the reconciliations as well. For the fourth quarter we experienced global revenue growth of 17.8% that includes a detrimental currency effect of approximately 1.8% of revenue or $6 million largely due to the weakening of the British pound, most acutely following Brexit on June 23. We experienced global unit sales growth of 13.8%. This unit growth we will elaborate upon further, largely driven by the same trends we talked about in the past, including elevated driving activity, accident rates, and total loss frequency. We observed service revenue growth of 18.8%, outpacing purchased car revenue growth of 11.8% largely due to our proactive shift from principal to agency cars, particularly for non-insurance business. Gross profit growth exceeded revenue growth. We grew from $118.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $141.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 which includes slight gross margin rate expansion. A few notes, just industry observations. Year-over-year scrap rates were now up 29% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, I\u2019ll share the information in a few moments as well, scrap was down for the full year. Year-over-year used car values were plus or minus flat as well. Moving along down the income statement for the quarter, G&A expenditures increased by $2 million, ex-D&A up approximately $3 million including D&A as we placed more software assets into service from development and began depreciating them. As we have noted on prior calls, G&A will continue to grow on an absolute dollar basis going forward, though with reasonable top line growth rates we should expect to achieve operating leverage. EBIT growth of 22.4%, yet again leveraged relative to the gross profit growth as well as revenue growth. Our interest expense for the quarter was elevated somewhat by upfront expenses incurred in connection with the recapitalization of our debt financing, which I'll describe in greater detail as well. GAAP net income then for the quarter was $84.1 million compared to $57.4 million a year ago. Now a few comments on our non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS. We experienced two distinct currency-related changes this quarter and this year that we've excluded from our non-GAAP net income. First, for the fourth quarter, an approximate post-tax effect of $4.8 million of booked gains on our currency balances. So we maintained cash balances outside the U.S. to the extent the U.S. dollar appreciates relative to the functional currencies in our non-U.S. operations will realize gains. We also experienced approximately $1.3 million of after-tax losses due largely to the weakening of the British pound following the Brexit event. Taxes for the quarter, you'll note, were meaningfully lower than our sustained run rate due primarily to our implementation of FASB ASU 2016-09 which is mandatory for all companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15 of this year. This accounting standard affects how companies account for the tax benefit of options exercises. In this case, our reduced tax expense was partially offset by the losses of certain foreign tax credits, again in connection with executive stock option exercises. We have effectively normalized so to speak our earnings for the quarter and for the year for these handful of events, including the currency changes as well as the tax accounting for stock option exercises. Our medium-term tax view has not changed. Excluding distortions from stock options exercises of this sort which are of course episodic in nature and therefore unpredictable, we do expect sustained tax rates consistent with our historical rates. Excluding these factors then we observed net income growth of approximately 17% year-over-year and EPS growth of over 30%, benefiting of course from stock repurchases completed this year and last year. I'll ask you to note that for the uniformity of presentation we also adjusted the prior year results and prior quarter results so the comparable numbers are equivalent. A few comments on the full year, systematically similar to the fourth quarter. Global revenue growth of 10.7%, detrimental currency effect of 1.5%, unit sales growth of 11.9%, again the same underlying growth factors that we talked about for the fourth quarter. Service revenue growth of 12.1% again outpaced purchased car revenue growth of 2.1% due to a shift from principal cars to agency. Gross profit growth slightly in excess of revenue, up 12.7% for the full year year-over-year, EBIT growth of 18%. GAAP net income growth went up 23% to $270.4 million and then on an adjusted net income basis again adjusting for those same events that I described a moment ago for the quarter, we experienced net income growth of 15% for the full year and EPS growth of 25% for the full year. Shifting gears to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We issued an 8-K in July to announce the results of our recent amendments to our credit agreement. We increased the total available liquidity to Copart by raising an $850 million revolver effectively replacing our term loan and existing revolver with a larger old revolving credit facility. Given the somewhat seasonal nature of our cash flow, the old revolver structure enabled us to minimize interest expense without compromising liquidity we can effectively pay down debt as we generate cash while knowing we still have access to it to fund growth and other seasonal needs. A few cash flow highlights. Our operating cash flow for the year of $332.5 million included substantial growth in our accounts receivable. Those who have followed Copart for some time know that these accounts receivables are largely advanced charges that we pay on behalf of our sellers for which we're ultimately reimbursed and therefore accounts receivables growth generally reflects inventory growth, inventory not in the GAAP sense but literally in the number of cars we maintain in our yards. We also experienced growth in our accounts payable and other accrued liabilities largely in the fourth quarter, due largely to tax withholdings for stock option exercises approximately $15 million, as well as a re-class of book overdrafts from cash. We're optimizing our cash position again with the benefit of the revolving credit facility, we seek to pay down debt when we can and therefore have book overdrafts in AP. Two final notes, CapEx of $30 million for the quarter and $173 million for the full year of that full year number of $173 million approximately 75% was for land lease buyouts and development, so in some sense capacity or land acquisition. We've talked previously about the 20/20/20 program we will elaborate in greater detail. The last note on share buybacks for the year, we purchased $11.3 million shares over the course of the full fiscal year at a weighted average price of $39.29 including the fourth quarter of last year we repurchased $17.8 million shares at an average price of $38.09. With that I'll turn it over to Will. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. I'll just reiterate what Jeff and Jay have already said. We're very pleased with the results for this quarter. The 17.8% growth in consolidated revenue came primarily from increased volumes as worldwide volume grew by 13.8%. I\u2019ll start with a few comments on the U.S. operations where volume increased 14% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in volume has come from growth and the size and our share of the salvage market, as well as growth in our non-insurance volume. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we are seeing growth on overall size of the North America salvage market. The growth in this market can be estimated by the product of three factors. The increase in the cars on the road or park, the growth in accident frequency or how often those cars involve in accidents, and the growth of the total loss frequency how often those cars involved in accidents are deemed to total economic loss. The mass yields and estimated growth in total cars for 2014, 2015 are between 7% and 9% and suggest using the current rate of growth in park and accident frequency and actual midyear growth rate for total loss frequency, a similar growth in 2016. While we expect the growth in park to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range, we do not see the drivers of the growth in accident frequency and total loss frequency abating. According to Independent Statistical Services or ISS, accident frequency increased 1.22% in 2015 and 0.85% for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in accident frequency is tied to the increase in miles driven, the increase in the rate of speed driven, higher levels of driver distraction and less safe drivers entering the driving population. The growth in miles driven of 3.1% is due primarily to lower fuel prices and higher employment trends. We're also seeing an increase in the rate of speed driven, as more of incremental miles are driven on rural roads and freeways and because speed limits in states are trending upwards. In 2015, five states passed legislation allowing for higher speed limits and similar legislation is pending in six other states. Driver distractions may also be contributing to the increase in accident frequency. A recent survey conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety over 42% of respondents have bided to reading emails or text and 31% indicated that they had actually typed text while driving during the last 30 days. Finally a recent study done by Brookings Senior Fellow, Clifford Winston suggests lower unemployment not only leads to more miles driven, it leads to riskier drivers on the road. While accident frequency is up, the greatest impact on the growth in total cars has come from growth and the total loss frequency driven by increase in repair costs relative to used vehicle values and option recoveries. The total loss decision is primarily an economic one, the cars totaled through repair cost exceeds, the net between the pre-accident values of the vehicle less the anticipated recovery at auction. Repair costs continue to grow primarily due to consolidation in the collision repair industry more severe accidents, greater complexity of newer cars and longer average replacement car rental times. According to CCC Information Services, since the year 2000, the percentage of volume processed by MSOs or multi-shop operations has more than tripled and now stands at almost 36%. And perhaps more interesting since 2010 the percentage of volume processed by dealerships has doubled now standing at 4%, suggesting a trend of increase in dealer collision repairs due to the complexity of restoring newer cars. Accident severity also appears to be increasing due to the higher rates of speed traveled and evidenced by the disproportional increase in traffic fatalities of 8% to the increase in miles driven of 3.1% and by the disproportionate increase in claim losses paid of 9.9% to the increased accident frequency. Cars are becoming more complex as they incorporate exotic and lightweight materials, inter-fit construction processes, sensors, cameras and other electronics, all of which demand that shops employ new equipment, tools and training, as well as acquiring more replacement parts per repair. According to CCC Information Services today's electronics are estimated to make up as much as 40% to 50% of the total cost of a vehicle. As a reference, the 2014 Mercedes S has seven cameras and 16 sensors, a trend we see as that being the middle level cars in the future. For most of these parts non-OEM alternatives are not available. Finally total loss frequency is impacted by the increasing length of time policy holders must be without their cars during the repair process, whether as a result of longer repair time or longer queue time letting to get into the collision repair shop. This increase not only elevates the total cost to repair the cars but also leads to dissatisfied policy holder. These factors have led to recent increases of total loss frequency in 2014, 2015 and 2016 of 1.2, 5.6 and 6.8% respectively. It should be noted that the growth in these years came in an environment when used car pricing remained relatively stable. During this period the Manheim Used Car Index rarely fluctuated more than 2% on year-over-year basis. With the expected growth in supply of used cars due to increased off lease volume, we expect used car pricing to trend downward putting additional upward pressure on total loss frequency. In addition to the growth in the size of the overall salvage market in the U.S. we saw a growth in our market share. And finally we saw growth in volume from our non-insurance suppliers of 14.5% and now represents 18.2% of our total volume. At the end of the quarter our U.S. inventory was up 20%, of which approximately 2.5% was attributable to CAT activity. In our second quarter we announced an initiative to add 20 new yards to our North America network. However, based on our revised expectations for volume growth, we\u2019ve expanded our objective for land acquisitions. Further we understand one of the key values we provide to our insurance customers is the ability to mitigate the risks of dissatisfied policy holders and of operational disruption during catastrophe. To provide that value we maintain excess capacity in both land and equipment. Our operations and our property acquisition teams performed remarkably in the recent series of CAT events in Louisiana, Texas and Colorado. Nevertheless we\u2019re increasing our excess land and equipment capacity in these and other high risk areas. Now I\u2019ll turn to the U.K. in which we also saw growth in units sold increasing by 12.6%. In the U.K. insurance volume grew due to increases in both size and share of the insurance salvage market. Further almost a third of the total volume growth came from non-insurance sellers. Non-insurance volume grew by 24.9% and now represents almost 17% of the total volume. At the end of the quarter our U.K. inventory was up over 20%. On a consolidated basis we experienced an increase in the average cost to process each car due to operating and environments of general growth, and the extra expense associated with operating in CAT environments and also due to the growth in inventory. We remain focused on controlling G&A expenses. G&A spend for the current quarter of $31 million was up on a year-over-year basis primarily due to increased spend on support for international operations and for brand and IT development. For the full fiscal year our G&A spend was below the spends for 2015 and 2014 by 3 and 16% respectively. The stronger dollar on a year-over-year basis had a negative impact on consolidated revenue and EBIT of $6.1 million and $1.6 million respectively. While we grew our consolidated revenue by 17.8%, we grew our gross margin and our operating margin by 19.1% and 22.4% respectively, once again demonstrating the operational leverage inherent in our business model. That concludes my comments. Samantha now we'll turn the call back over to you to coordinate the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Lee Jagoda : This is actually Lee Jagoda for Bob Labick. Good morning. So just want to start on Germany, can you discuss the difference between having the demo auctions and now the live auctions and what the opportunity is there and whether the insurance customers are the same as you have in the U.K, or are they new customers for you. Jayson Adair : Well, first we really won\u2019t address the international operations outside of the U.K that they're not meaningful to our financial results, but we will talk about our increased confidence in our international strategy and our view of the opportunity in Germany as well as all of Western Europe. So, it's important to understand that Europe operates on a different model in terms of the total loss settlement process. In Mainland Europe, the insurance company simply gives the policy holder a check for the diminished value of their car, and then it's up to the policy holder to dispose of that car. We think that the Copart model provides value not only to the policy holder because obviously under the Copart model, they're getting a full reimbursement for that car upfront providing them the ability to go and replace that car immediately as opposed to waiting until they ultimately dispose of a wrecked asset. We also think it provides value to the other constituents of this transaction including the buyer. So in the German model, a buyer will submit a bid for a wrecked car and then wait as long as 21 days before he knows if he will receive that car. And in fact statistics show that ultimately the buyer gets that car less than 10% of time. So it's important to know that these buyers are buying raw material for their business, they take these to increase value and they need access to these cars at a specific time and a car of a specific type. And so for them to wait 21 days means that they're willing to bid less for those cars because of the uncertainty. So in this model, they\u2019re actually bidding less for the cars, which means the insurance companies are paying too much in their settlement because the recoveries are less than what they would be under the efficient model that Copart provides. So we're very comfortable that we can come into this market and provide value. In fact we think that the insurance companies that adopt us have an opportunity to be somewhat disruptive in that market. We've done three test auctions, and in all three of those test auctions, the returns that we achieved were substantially greater than the returns achieved under the current model of disposing of those cars. I'm not sure if that answered all your questions, Lee, but I think that gives kind of a good overview of that market and our view of how we will affect it. Lee Jagoda : That was very helpful, thank you. And one more from me, and I'll hop back in the queue. You mentioned several Greenfield openings, and it sounds like you're going to be expanding those Greenfields overtime. Can you just discuss a little bit about the upfront costs and how long it typically takes for you to get more normalized margins at those Greenfields? Jayson Adair : Yes, first off - everyone is different. So we can open up some Greenfields and we will have volume immediately, and obviously in that situation, the upfront detriment to our margins is much shorter. I would say it was typically about a year before they are up and fully operational and functional, in general. Lee Jagoda : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Jay, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the commentary you guys provided about kind of total loss. That was helpful how you talked about the cars on the road, the frequency and just the total loss relationship. But is there a way you could kind of size for us your conversations you might have with some of the consulting companies or the insurance companies about ultimately where they think total loss can go to as a percentage of accidents, and over the last 10 or 15 year it's been an expanding number but kind of ultimately maybe over the next five years or so, where do you think that can go as a percentage of accidents? Jayson Adair : I just talked about all the elements that influence that number and so you'd have kind of come to your own decision about how those will be affected by the introduction of new technologies and new laws. We don\u2019t think that in the short term I am referencing probably three or four, five years that anything is going to change with the current trends. Jeffrey Liaw : And I might add to that. Some insurance companies run as high as 20% in total loss and the average for the industry today quoted by CCC is 17\u2026 Jayson Adair : About 19. Jeffrey Liaw : 19, right now, okay. So in average of 19%, some are as high as 20% and yes the shift 25 years ago was closer to 10%. So it continued to - we used to give the analogy of the throwaway television. You had TV repairmen 50 years ago, and now that's pretty rare. So it\u2019s the same thing with vehicle. As the complexity of vehicles increases, it makes them much more likely to total loss. Unidentified Company Representative : Hi John, this is [indiscernible], I'd just add this color. I\u2019d say that for the past 10 years I think a big contributor to salvage frequency has been the increasing age of the fleet so as cars went aged from 7.5 to 11.5 years that I think is a good part of the story for these salvage increase you heard Will and Jay talk about historically. Prospectively from here I think the age will likely stabilize, I think most of the projections I\u2019ve seen indicate that to be true but these other forces I think will increasingly contribute. So vehicle complexity, rear cameras, side view blind spot these extra systems and so forth those have really penetrated vehicles are starting to penetrate vehicles now. I think the severity part of the equation is likely a forward-looking phenomenon as much as it is backwards. John Healy : Sure [indiscernible]. I guess the last question, I was trying to hoping that maybe try to get a little more of a forecast so. You talked about some of the insurance companies are 20% now, I mean is there a way of thinking where you think that number had the feeling to go to or potentially kind of the ultimate end game there? Unidentified Company Representative : I don't think we\u2019re in a better position to give you a point forecast than you are to develop your own. The contributors to these are many fold as you know, right, used car values, repair cost, repair time, body shop utilization. There are just too many contributing factors to give you a point estimate. We do believe the trend is generally favorable. John Healy : Got you. And then I want to ask about the purchase car business, I know it has a tendency to jump around a little bit. With the scrap values kind of maybe picking up a little bit and maybe you\u2019re having some freed up capacity as you\u2019ve put some of the yards on. Is it reasonable to think that you\u2019ll be more active on purchase car in fiscal '17 than '16, or is there any kind of parameters you can put around that? Jayson Adair : No, I don\u2019t think the activity is going to change in a meaningful manner. It\u2019s just not a big enough part of our business to move the needle. John Healy : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Good morning. In the three months ended in August there is an almost 30% increase in the crushed auto body pricing according to American Recycler. It looks like September the pricing was up almost 50% year-over-year which seems like it bodes well for the first quarter. Do you think it\u2019s fair to say that salvage value should keep trending upward? Jeffrey Liaw : Elizabeth this is Jeff. On this one dimension alone it's certainly the case, the scrap values have improved year-over-year. I think it\u2019s worth noting a couple of things. One, scrap value most acutely affects our lowest end cars. So a car that's likely to be rebuilt likely to be returned to service for some number of years export or otherwise is affected much less by scrap. So it\u2019s the lowest end vehicles that are affected not literally, not necessarily the high end cars, part one. Part two is, there are other contributing forces so the strength of the U.S. dollar being an important consideration given the number of cars we export out of the U.S. The dollar has clearly strengthened against a lot of our reference currencies, a lot of our export currencies. So that\u2019s an offsetting consideration. But yes, all else equal scrap improvement year-over-year would be helpful, yes. Elizabeth Suzuki : Got you, okay. That's helpful. Second, a lot of people are looking at the federal automated vehicle\u2019s policy as an endorsement by the federal government of autonomous check which they\u2019re saying is going to significantly enhance vehicle safety. And what do you think is a realistic timeline of how quickly autonomous check could really be adopted to the point where it actually impacts the accident rate of the overall fleet and is it just too far down the line to be considered relevant? Jeffrey Liaw : Elizabeth we've done a fair bit of homework on this questions you could imagine ourselves and when I look - I\u2019d say we have seen historical analog in the sense that we\u2019ve seen accidents rates decline for a very long period of time. So from the mid 1970s to 2011 accident rates declined very steadily as the last generation of accident avoidance technologies spread through the market. It took decades for it to do so which is also going to be true today. If the U.S. for example will see 15 million or 17 million of new car shipments in a given year, we have a car park of 250 million or 260 million cars. It is just decades but the math is fairly straightforward. It will take decades before all cars have these technologies. The second note is, over that same period of time from the 1970s to 1980s, to 2011 the salvage industry grew well because the decline in accidents was more than offset by the total loss frequency which is again a function of repair cost, vehicle age and so forth. So we\u2019ve seen this movie before. I think a lot of that will be true going forward as well. A lot of the technologies that makes automobile safer also make them much more expensive to repair. You heard Will talk about computers and sensors and so forth. The typical car is much more complex today than it was 10 years ago. So the math is decades, I think it\u2019s an open question as to precisely how many but I think it\u2019s decades away. Elizabeth Suzuki : Yes, it makes sense. All right thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know that you don\u2019t give - traditionally, you don\u2019t traditionally give very detailed guidance but you did speak to many of the revenue drivers continuing into next year. What will you say are some of the other big drivers of performance in fiscal '17 versus '16 that investors should keep in mind so for example the trend in yard and fleet costs are G&A or capital investments? Jeffrey Liaw : Ryan, that's an understatement. I think we do not historically provide detailed guidance or general guidance but I think your enquiry is fair. The most important driver you did hear Will talk about which is the unit growth and therefore growth assumptions. I\u2019d say just looking backwards say four to eight quarters, big divers are currency, scrap values, catastrophic events which can cause higher than normalized cost incurrence, G&A is largely predictable for us, we don\u2019t provide forward guidance except to say that it will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis given the increased size and complexity of our business. So there are no other discontinuities. I think the general trends should be similar. As for capital investment, I think you noted at the end of your question about capital investment, that won't per se affect the P&L that substantially as you know we have deployed meaningful capital and land assets. So if you went to some other measures of operating performance, returns on invested capital and so forth, our investments and our infrastructure could of course affect those numbers. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great thanks. And then just last question is on the international markets outside the U.K. I am just curious if your performance in any of these different regions has caused you to want to invest more so for example in India I don\u2019t know if the experience there has caused you, do you want to keep investing or is it conversely possible to that your experience have having entered a market may not have been what you imagined the market maybe different and you could potentially look to be also exiting some opportunities too. Thanks. Jayson Adair : Yes, I would say that all of our recent experiences have done nothing but make us feel more optimistic about these markets and the timing is somewhat uncertain but we will be proceeding with systems and resources and I anticipate real estate as well. Ryan Brinkman : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated. Unidentified Analyst : Hi good morning. This is [Daniel Hamburger] [ph] on for Ben. So first, you talked about expanding the land acquisition plans. Can you talk about maybe trends you\u2019re seeing in those markets? What makes you confident in building out that type of capacity? William Franklin : Simply growth in volume. It's kind of funny, I used to be on the finance side and I was always arguing that you need to operate yards at 100% capacity. And for the six weeks during the time of the year where you have peak, you just operate it efficiently, that doesn\u2019t work. On the off side, you have to have a certain amount of excess capacity and now as we enter an environment where we\u2019re having CAT situations more frequently for whatever reason, it amplifies the need to have excess capacity in terms of land to adequately serve our insurance customers. And so because of that, we're - because of the increase of volume, because of the increase in cash and because of the growth in our market share, we find ourselves in a position where we really need to expand our network of facilities. Jayson Adair : Daniel, let me quantify it a little bit for you. Copart from an inventory perspective, grew 20% in the quarter. We have over 400,000 cars on the ground. So if you do that math and you then calculate that you can only store about 100 cars per acre, and you sit back and you think about the fact that Copart added over 60,000 units to inventory year-over-year, you\u2019ve got to add 600 acres of land to the company. And that's the kind of growth that we\u2019ve been seeing in the last year and that's, as Will said, we anticipate that growth going forward. So we are - when we talk about our 20/20/20 program that was where we started six months ago. We will anticipate opening more than 20 locations at this point and expanding more than 20 locations at this point because of the growth in units and the corresponding growth and inventories because we have to store those vehicles. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks, very, very helpful. And I kind of on the same line about volumes. We\u2019ve been hearing reports of a significant number of flood damaged vehicles out of Louisiana. How does that compare, I guess to maybe a Katrina or a Sandy or what are you guys hearing out of those markets? Jayson Adair : Yes, that market - I went in with a team during that event. That market is about a quarter the size of Hurricane Katrina off the top of my head. So big event. We picked up a lot of cars, but still relatively small compared to a Katrina. In terms of a Hurricane Sandy, Sandy was less than Katrina, probably a third off the top of my head the size of Hurricane Sandy. Unidentified Analyst : All right, great. Well congratulations on a good quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning. I guess thinking about acreage, and then maybe we could look at the acreage that the $173 million in CapEx last year. You said maybe 75% of that was land lease and development. And then maybe do you have a expectation for how much acreage you might add in '17? Jayson Adair : I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s just extremely difficult to give you a response because of the uncertainty of acquiring this land. Not only is it difficult to locate, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get it properly zoned. And the timing of that creates the uncertainty I\u2019m talking about. In total if you look at the total schedule of properties that we're targeting, it's in the many hundreds of acres. And so over the course of probably two years, we\u2019ll be expending a significant amount of capital to obtain those acres. And the math is right. I mean, if we talked about volume growth. If you've got three years of volume growth at 8%, you're at a 27% growth in overall market. And if you assume your markets 4 million cars, you\u2019re well over 1 million cars, additional cars. And so it\u2019s becoming a real issue. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so extremely focused on it. We have a lot of resources focused on paying this land because without this land you can\u2019t properly satisfy and service your insurance customers. William Franklin : Hi, Brad just a little more color here. I think the reason you hear us reluctant to provide more specific forward-looking guidance on this is because real estate by its nature is so episodic and unpredictable. We were pursuing land in Southern California for 20 plus years until we found a yard that made sense for us at the location, the permitting and the value available to us. So the business is somewhat elastic. If you look at an aerial photo of our nearby yards in Southern California until we opened a new one, they were clearly fuller than other yards within Copart. We want to be disciplined about how we buy land. We expect to be aggressive about buying and developing land, but that\u2019s also somewhat dependent on availability, permitting, timing and so forth. So it\u2019s a big part of our forward-looking strategy. It\u2019s just very hard to narrow it down to say next quarter. It\u2019s precisely this many yards, it\u2019s precisely this many millions of dollars. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I think when you talked about the 14% U.S. unit growth or volume growth, you mentioned market share gain. And could you give us a feeling, maybe what contribution market share was to that 14% i.e. drilling down towards farmers? Jayson Adair : Yes, a lot of the volume that we had in market share was a year ago in the farmers account. There\u2019s some new business that\u2019s come on in the most recent quarter. So you\u2019ll be seeing that trend extending in the year. So as I think Will or Jeff is about to give you a number, I want to make sure you understand that, that number will increase as we go into the new year from additional market share gains. William Franklin : Yes, it is a lot difficult to arrive at a specific number with that certainty. I mean if we look at the growth in the market, we assume it\u2019s 8%. And that\u2019s 20% of our business, 6.5% to 7% came from market growth. And so the balance came from either new business or CAT. And the CAT level is probably 2% of that. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then one last sort of follow-up. You talked about what drives the salvage, the total rates. And you said MSO market share gains. Are MSO average checks higher than independent average checks? It was my understanding that insurance companies allocate direct repair programs based on low-cost repair and seem to be focusing towards MSOs. Is that incorrect? William Franklin : I won't comment on that other than to say that industry research suggests that one of the drivers of the increase in the cost of repair these cars is the consolidation that\u2019s occurring. So you\u2019d have to imply that by that statement. Bret Jordan : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning, gentlemen. So it looks like your average revenue per vehicle is directionally increasing. You talked about scrap prices at the low end of your vehicle. So what other drivers might there be driving higher revenue per vehicle? William Franklin : Every country has its own profile of car that we sell. Every insurance company has its own profile of cars that they provide to us. Some insurance salvage at a higher damage rate, some at a lower damage rate. Overall trends in used car pricing, FX, scrap metal pricing; things like proximity to port have an impact on the selling price of the vehicle. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of inputs and drivers in this ASP movement. Bill Armstrong : Got it. And on the foreign exchange front, you only have over the last couple of years, I guess, with the stronger dollar, that has sort of suppressed bidding from international buyers. And now with the dollar kind of leveling off a little bit, are you seeing those buyers coming back or getting more aggressive in their bidding? William Franklin : We have. We\u2019ve seen just a marginal increase in international activity, but nothing near where it was two years ago. Bill Armstrong : Okay. But it sounds like the deterioration of that is sort of, kind of reached an end there? William Franklin : That\u2019s fair. Jayson Adair : It is actually up, as Will said. William Franklin : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Paige with Gabelli and Company. Matthew Paige : Hi, good morning. To follow-up on your age commentary before with lower new car sales in the 2009 to 2011 time frame, do you see any potential impact or air pockets as these units move into the latter stages of their lifecycle? Jeffrey Liaw : What do you mean by air pockets, Matthew? Matthew Paige : It is just as - you have some higher sales going into 2008 and then you have lower sales coming out of the recession and before they start to recover in 2012. So you have a couple of years there where the lower sales are starting to get into their prime age for salvage parts or to be totaled. Jayson Adair : Clearly, it has caused the average age of vehicles to move up, as Jeff stated earlier. In terms of bucket of cars that are missing in that particular year, I think if you - if we can just take an extreme, if we didn\u2019t sell any cars one year and the next year we sold twice as many cars, I think it would just move the average down. I don\u2019t think it would be indicative of some kind of air pocket or other impact. So, it definitely had an impact in the average age of the vehicles. And as Jeff stated, that is starting to reverse now as we\u2019re seeing 17 million new car sales a year. Matthew Paige : Okay, great, thanks. And then second question for me is could you remind us the penetration of transportation and storage fees and sales you make on the unit sold at auction? William Franklin : I\u2019m sorry. Jayson Adair : I didn\u2019t understand. William Franklin : What was the question? Matthew Paige : Of the units you sell at auction, what is the penetration of them that you can take ancillary revenue from transport and storage fees? Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks for the question, Matt. I think you are asking about attachment rates for other ancillary services that Copart provides. Its buyers or sellers and we don\u2019t customarily comment on those kinds of things. Matthew Paige : Okay, well thank you and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Speakers, at this time, I\u2019m showing there are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for closing remarks. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Samantha. Again, thank you, everyone, for attending the fourth quarter call. We will be reporting on the first quarter in the New Year fiscal 2017 on the next call. We look forward to chatting with everyone then. Thanks so much. Bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

Craig Kennison - Baird Elizabeth Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Matthew Paige - Gabelli & Company Bob Labick - CJS Securities William Armstrong - C. L. King & Associates Operator : Welcome to the Copart Incorporated first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Jay Adair : Welcome to the first quarter call for Copart. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeffrey Liaw our CFO who will give you an update on the financial performance for the quarter and then he will pass it over to Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President who will talk about some of the operational affects that we had in the quarter. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce you all to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw : I\u2019ll start with the Safe Harbor. During today\u2019s call we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP net income per diluted share which excludes the impact of foreign currency related gains and the tax effect of recent executive stock option exercises. We\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the investor relations\u2019 link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with their corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. Copart\u2019s management analyzes its results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. A cautionary note about our forward-looking statements. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions in our latest periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf.  Per our custom, I\u2019ll start with a brief review of our income statement and then progress through the balance sheet and cash flow statement as well. We\u2019re pleased with the result of our first quarter in fiscal 2017. We\u2019ve continued the basis of the presentation that was shared with you in the last quarter with a non-GAAP presentation to account for certain foreign currency related gains as well as stock option exercises. I\u2019ll provide more color on both of those to come. Starting with the headlines, we experienced global revenue growth of 19.8% and that\u2019s after accounting for the detrimental currency effects on revenue of approximately $9 million, largely due to the depreciation of the pound relative to the dollar. We grew unit sales volume worldwide at approximately 19% with US unit growth of approximately 20% and international unit growth of approximately 14%. Global inventory growth was 25% of which 5% is attributable to catastrophic weather events. Service revenue growth outpaced that of purchase car revenue growth with $56 million of our growth attributable to service revenue and $1 million attributable to purchase car revenue growth. This is largely due to a proactive shift on our part from purchase car volumes to agency arrangements instead.  We experienced gross profit growth from $120.9 million to $145.3 million. A couple of points of color, we did experience year-over-year scrap price improvement of approximately 26%. We continue to cite the same American Recycler Index averaging five different regions over the three months in the quarter. On an absolute dollar basis, of course, the scrap portion of the value in our auctions remains relatively small, but we did experience year-over-year improvement in that important index.  Year-over-year used car values are approximately flat or up 1% using the Manheim Index again, averaged over the three relevant months. Our G&A expenditures on a GAAP basis increased by $3.8 million ex depreciation and amortization. However, it\u2019s worth noting that $5.2 million of the G&A expenses are attributable to payroll taxes due to stock options exercised, so we, of course, view these as non-recurring expenditures or episodic expenditures tied to stock option exercises not incurred in the ordinary course of running the business. Our depreciation and amortization increased slightly as we placed more software assets into service. As always, we provide the general framework that G&A will continue to grow on an absolute dollar basis over time so with reasonable growth rates we should expect to achieve operating leverage.  I wanted to take a minute here to pause on the non-GAAP compensation related adjustments. This is again, due to exercises by certain Copart executives of outstanding vested options. In effect, what happens is this creates a tax deduction for Copart with an excess tax benefit to Copart of approximately $101 million. As a result, you\u2019ll note that Copart\u2019s GAAP tax provision for the quarter was actually a substantial tax benefit instead. In practice, we withhold a portion of the shares the executives are exercising, retire those shares for cash and remit the payments to the IRS. In reality, we have effectively prepaid a majority of our US federal income tax liability for Fiscal \u201917 already by remitting that cash to the IRS. We experienced EBIT growth of 21.5% from $86 million to $104.8. However, please do note that $104.8 is burdened by $5.2 million of the payroll taxes I described a moment ago, which we believe are generally non-recurring and episodic expenditures. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately flat year-over-year due to higher revolver balance. Again, due to the cash tax payments on stock option exercises offset by lower drawn rates. GAAP net income of course, increased substantially as a result of the negative tax provision. On a non-GAAP basis, the only other matter I haven\u2019t already mentioned is the reversal in our adjustments of foreign currency related gains of $2.8 million post tax. We hold certain cash balances in our overseas businesses and when the US dollar appreciates we experience positive gains that shows up in other income. We have unwound that gain for the purposes of calculating our non-GAAP adjusted net income. The bottom line then is an adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $0.57. Turning our attention then to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. Cash flow is again, affected by that same cash tax payment we made on behalf of the stock option exercises. We nevertheless, experienced operating cash flow for the quarter of $74 million a reflection first of course, of increased earnings or increased EBIT. We also experienced substantial accounts receivable growth of just shy of $30 million. As you know, these are primarily advanced charges paid out on behalf of our customers so that when we pick up the cars we can access them. The growth therefore in AR corresponds to the inventory growth we described previously. The increase in deferred and current income tax assets net is approximately $70 million. That\u2019s again, the same tax issue I described a moment ago. We had capital expenditures of $38 million for the quarter of which approximately three-quarters to 80% is attributable to land and development and lease buyouts. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our EVP, Will Franklin. William Franklin : As Jeff said, we are very pleased with the results of our first quarter fiscal 2017. The growth in revenue of 19.8% mirrors our growth in volume of 19.4%. This is the third successive quarter in which revenue has grown by 17% or more and the fourth successive quarter volume has grown by 13% or more. In fact, we have averaged growth in our inventory of over 15% over the last nine quarters. I\u2019ll start with a few comments on US operations where year-over-year volume increased by 20%. As we have discussed in our previous earnings calls, we believe the overall size of the US total loss market is increasing in size at an annual rate of between 8% and 10%. While the growth of the US salvage market is marginally attributed to growth in both car parts and accident frequency. The largest contributor is growth in total loss frequency. Total loss frequency continues to rise as repair costs continue to grow due to consolidation in the collision repair industry, more severe accidents, greater complexity of newer cars, and longer average replacement car rental times.  On top of the organic growth we have layered on an increase in our share of the market and growth in our non-insurance volume. Non-insurance volume grew by 18.4% and in total represented 18.6% of our volume. The growth was led by increases in charity and donation cars and in broker cars. At the end of the quarter our US inventory was up 26.1% of which approximately 5.4% was attributed to CAT activity. Now I\u2019ll turn to revenue in the UK where we saw a growth in units sold of 12.4%. Insurance volume grew to increases in both the size and our share of the insurance salvage market. Non-insurance growth was 20% as the dealer and the direct purchase programs continued to expand in both volume and in profitability.  Measured in GBP, UK revenue grew by 16.4% and its EBIT grew by over 40%. However, after translation to USD, revenue was down marginally and the EBIT grew by only 18.1% due to the strengthening of the dollar to the pound. On a consolidated basis, we experienced an increase in average cost to process each car due primarily to operating in an environment of general growth, the extra expenses associated with operating in CAT environments, and due to the growth in inventory. We remain focused on controlling G&A expenses. G&A spend for the quarter was $35.2 million. As Jeff mentioned, included in that total is $5.2 million for the company portion of payroll taxes associated with the exercise of stock options. We consider this to be an extraordinary and unique item due to its magnitude. This expense averaged less than $60,000 per quarter in fiscal 2016. Excluding this item, G&A was $30 million, marginally lower than the same quarter last year. We expected G&A to grow as we continue to expand our international efforts and increase our IT resources.  Finally, our capacity expansion efforts continue. During the quarter, we added two yards and we expanded five existing yards, increasing our total capacity by approximately 140 acres. In our second fiscal quarter, we expect to add another five yards, five sub lots, and to expand nine existing yards, increasing capacity by another 529 acres.  Now, that concludes my comments. I\u2019ll turn the call back over for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question about your buyer base. I was wondering if you could give us some color in terms of the number of vehicles that are probably leaving the US and maybe the amount that are headed to Latin America, maybe the amount that are headed to Europe, and the Middle East? I\u2019m just trying to conceptualize with some of the volatile movements in the global currency markets what those could mean to ASPs and buying behavior by your customers. William Franklin : I can tell you that the trend is down. We were at one time up to 23%, 24% of cars [and you sold to] [ph] international buyers. That currently is below 20%. Like I said, expressed in units and expressed in values it\u2019s about the same, it\u2019s slightly less than 20% of our volume and about the same amount of value of cars sold to buyers that are registered internationally. I will say this though, that understates the number of cars that are leaving the country because there\u2019s a number of buyers that are registered domestically that do nothing but export. Obviously, because of the strength in the dollar is having a detrimental impact on their activity. John Healy : Is there a way to think about just Mexico or Latin America, what percentage of the buyer base is represented by them? William Franklin : In terms of activity about 7% of our volume goes to Mexico currently and that\u2019s down from about 9% nine quarters ago so you\u2019re seeing a slight decline in their participation in our auctions. They are by far the largest international buyer. John Healy : You mentioned the acreage in addition to the number of yards in the expansion, is there a way to think about kind of acreage in the business today and maybe what an acre of land translates into the amount of capacity in terms of vehicles you could store and kind of marshal for the insurance folks? William Franklin : Generally, it\u2019s 125 cars per acre. But, that changes depending on the nature of the situation we find ourselves in. That\u2019s the most efficient layout for the operations of a yard. In times of CAT we can squeeze far more cars onto a yard, but we operate far less efficiently. In fact, you\u2019ll see part of that expressed in our margins this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Of the inventory growth, could you carve out what might have been a market share contribution to that as well? William Franklin : If you\u2019re talking about just the insurance, you can kind of back into that. Of the growth, in terms of volumes sold, about a little less than 3% is from CAT. Like I said, we think it\u2019s 10% of that just because of organic market growth, so that leaves you about 7% in market share gains. Bret Jordan : Is that a trend that\u2019s accelerating? Is there anything changing or any changes as far as insurance RFP activity going on now or maybe going on in the near future? William Franklin : There\u2019s always activity and we\u2019re always out there competing aggressively to get new business. I can\u2019t say that what\u2019s going on now is any different than what was going on a year ago. Bret Jordan : Can you give us an update on Germany as far as the international business goes? William Franklin : As we announced we had our first auction in September. Since then we\u2019ve had two more auctions. I should distinguish or clarify the nature of these auctions. These are test auctions so the insurance companies are not participating in these auctions. We have another one scheduled December 14th. We\u2019re taking a very measured approach to rolling this out to the insurance companies. We want to ensure we have it right when we do introduce our product.  We\u2019re very confident that that will happen in this fiscal year and we\u2019re very optimistic and pleased with the interest that we\u2019ve seen from the insurance companies. But, like I said, we\u2019re going to be measured in our rollout and that may mean it will be a few months from now before we do introduce it to the insurance companies. Jay Adair : I\u2019m going to add to that. I was in Germany two weeks ago meeting with our team. We currently have a location that is north of Hanover and we\u2019re going to be opening up additional locations across Germany in the next 18 months. We\u2019re very, very committed to the market. When we\u2019re done it\u2019s going to take about a half a dozen locations to service the market. From a logistical standpoint, if we\u2019re mature in the market it\u2019ll take more like the UK, about 15 locations but in the interim you just want to be in a position where you\u2019ve got coverage and you can logistically pick the car up anywhere in the country. So, as Will stated we expect to go live this year and then we\u2019ll be expanding in fiscal \u201918. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Really nice unit growth in the quarter. It looks like from the inventory growth numbers that should continue going forward. You called out 5.4% of the inventory growth was CAT volume. I\u2019m curious, are you able to quantify the amount of cost you may have incurred in the most recent quarter for units you\u2019ve yet to sell that are sitting in inventory? Is that an easy number to carve out? William Franklin : It\u2019s in the millions. In some of the CAT situations we\u2019re spending as much as $500 a car to repair the car and millions of dollars to locate new land, and to bring people in from different parts of the country to man these operations. Very little of that gets put on the balance sheet so that\u2019s flushed through at the time we recover the cars and as I mentioned earlier, that suppresses our gross margin percentage. Jeffrey Liaw : Ben, to give you just a sliver more color on that, I think broadly speaking even EX catastrophic events, when Copart grows inventory, in particular, sequentially as we have done this quarter we incur a meaningful proportion of the cost in the period in which we grow it even before we sell it. We also recognize a portion of the revenue due to certain revenue recognition requirements, but the net effect of growing inventory is a depressive effective on gross margins. I think to Will\u2019s point, that is further enhanced by catastrophic events in which the costs you incur in a current period are still higher. Ben Bienvenu : Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the yard expansions. Obviously, it underscores your confidence for the structural step up in volume you expect to experience over the long term in the business. I\u2019m curious, how far along are you there? Have your goals around 20/20/20 changed from the last time you communicated them? Then, as you\u2019re building out the yard, expansions and adding new acreage, is there any material cost delivers that result from that activity or is it negligible? William Franklin : Let me address a few of those. On the 20/20/20 program, it has changed. It\u2019s expanded significantly. The 20/20/20 referred to buying 20 new yards, opening 20 new yards, expanding 20 existing yards in the next 20 months and we\u2019ll exceed that significantly which underscores our confidence not only in the growth of the market but perhaps a chance in the way we approach how we operate. We look at land not only through an operational lens but also through a strategic lens and we intend to be able to offer excess capacity to our suppliers, our partners, in times of catastrophic needs and in order to do that you have to have a significant amount of excess capacity particularly in the high-risk areas. Jay Adair : A couple of thoughts in response to your question. I would say your point about reflecting our confidence in the business is true. Some of these land acquisitions and developments projects are not speculative, their responsive to existing cars on the ground, their responsive to existing volumes that we\u2019re facing. So, they\u2019re not all just perspective bets on growth to come. I think that addresses your second question which was the leveraging or deleveraging effects of these new yards.  I think there\u2019s a few offsetting considerations. One is that our sub haul expense per car typically goes down with the addition of new real estate. By definition a yard is closer to sum accidents than your old yard network was, so your sub haul expenses should come down per car. There also is a cost of congestion. This is Will\u2019s point a moment ago, particularly in catastrophic events when you have cars packed too tightly in yards, you have higher labor costs and higher handling costs that you otherwise might which new yards helps to relieve.  The third point I think, is the one you were getting at, which is when we do add new real estate, there is potentially some deleveraging of people costs as you staff a new yard with a general manager, with yard and office staff, forklifts and the like so there is some offsetting effects. On balance, I think the effects aren\u2019t huge. It obviously varies by yard and by circumstance. Ben Bienvenu : Just one last very quick one. Your normalized tax rate, it\u2019s been a little bit lower the last couple quarters than we\u2019ve seen in the past. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s your expectation for tax rate might be on a normalized basis going forward? Jay Adair : I think we\u2019ve previously said, or Will has said, our tax rate is in the 35% to 36% normalized level. I think if you exclude the noise that we experienced this quarter we\u2019re about in line with that so our forward expectations haven\u2019t changed barring obviously a major policy shift by one or more of our major countries. Operator : Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : I wonder if you\u2019d simply review your IT priorities for the next 12 months or so. Jeffrey Liaw : We\u2019ve got great systems domestically. Across the board we\u2019re extremely happy with our web services, our mobile services and the systems that we operate in our company. Without a doubt, the majority of the focus right now is on Germany. We always have some maintenance that will exist on existing operations both UK and US and other countries that we\u2019re doing business in. But, right now if you\u2019re thinking from the standpoint of resource, energy, effort, dollars, time, we are putting the majority of that right now into Germany and our ability to get into that market and succeed. Craig Kennison : A second question on the election, just wondering what the broad implication of the election results might be on your business especially as it relates to repatriation? I\u2019m wondering how much you have funds tied up over seas and whether you\u2019re be interested in repatriating them if tax policy were to change? Jay Adair : A substantial portion of our cash is in fact kept overseas. If there is a policy change I think we evaluate it at that moment and time whether the investments overseas justify keeping the cash there or bringing them back here for general corporate purposes here. At the moment, I think there are growth opportunities, Germany included, as you heard from Will that could consume some of that cash. Craig Kennison : Any concern about regulatory changes NAFTA, things like that? Jeffrey Liaw : No. I think the question earlier was about international export and off the top of my head will said it was just under 8% Mexico. Off the top of my head it\u2019s just a little over 10% total Latin American countries. I don\u2019t, at this point, these aren\u2019t new products, so why the export of used vehicles would be an issue. We are constantly interacting with Mexico and have relationships with Mexico on shipping vehicles south of the border so I don\u2019t anticipate anything negative at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Elizabeth Suzuki : Can you guys give an update on your expected CAPEX 2017 given the investment that you\u2019re making in capacity growth? Jay Adair : We generally don\u2019t provide forward guidance on either our income statement or cash flow statement. What I\u2019ll reiterate is this is when we talked about 20/20/20 the program initially, and that was in March of this year, we talked about spending an extra $100 million in the first calendar year and it being approximately a two year program, the 20 months representing the two years. We believe, if anything, that our expectations have increased relative to the total investments that we will make over the relevant multiple horizon. At this moment, with real estate being episodic and as lumpy as it is, it\u2019s difficult for us to pinpoint precisely how much we expect to invest over the course of this fiscal year. But the elevated capital expenditures you\u2019ve observed in the last five quarters we believe will continue. Elizabeth Suzuki : Just one other quick one. What are your internal forecasts, if you can share them, for movement in the dollar commodity prices, etcetera that could potentially change your strategy over the next couple of years? Jay Adair : I don\u2019t think we have any differential insight relative to what you or your colleagues at Bank of America might. We don\u2019t perform meaningful bottoms up currency forecasts at Copart. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : In terms of the catastrophic events with the hurricanes and the floods, have you taken in the majority of the cars that you\u2019re going to get from both of those issues? William Franklin : Yes, we have. When we look back, and they\u2019re all different in nature. We\u2019ve had seven events, and we\u2019ve characterized three of those as significant CAT events. Mathew, the flooding in Baton Rouge, and the flooding in Houston which exerted an extraordinary burden on our operations and our cost structure. But, of those three CATs plus the hail storms in Dallas and Colorado Springs, we received most of those cars already and most of those are in inventory. Gary Prestopino : In terms of your share gains in the US, are there many independents left since you\u2019ve been taking share? I know you\u2019ve got one big competitor, but what\u2019s that landscape look like? Are these smaller independents gradually just going out of business? Jay Adair : At this point I would just say we\u2019ve got one major competitor, as you referred to. There is a secondary competitor out there that we compete with. As Will has commented in previous calls, the market has been growing and we foresee the market is going to continue to grow so market share is an important part of our growth and we\u2019re always, as I think Jeff or Will referred to earlier, we\u2019re always competitive and eager to win new business. But, right now we have our hands full, if you will, with the fact that total loss frequency is up. When you\u2019ve got a company the size of Copart and you\u2019re growing 10% a year just in the industry, there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do in making sure we have capacity, and people, and the logistics in place to pick the vehicles up, store them, and then sell them. Gary Prestopino : Lastly, the majority of what you process or sell in the UK, is that kept within the UK or is some of that exported into the European Continent? William Franklin : No. It\u2019s very similar to the US, about 80% of it stays in the UK and about 20% leaves the country. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Paige with Gabelli & Company. Matthew Paige : My first question, how do you view your non-insurance revenue growth potential looking forward given the population of used cars coming back? Along those lines, how do you prioritize taking in insurance cars from those cars? William Franklin : We\u2019re focused on insurance company cars. We\u2019re focused on insurance companies period. That\u2019s our life. That\u2019s all we live and breathe around here. To the extent we can, without distracting from our ability to perform for the insurance companies, add these non-insurance cars, then we do so. But our focus is not on the non-insurance cars. Matthew Paige : That\u2019s similar to your acreage growth strategy in terms of that is focused for the insurance companies, it\u2019s not on building capacity to be able to take on more non-insurance volume? Jay Adair : It absolutely is to take on more non-insurance volume as well as insurance. Will was being very clear that we\u2019re focused on handling insurance companies but Copart\u2019s not in the business of saying no. We take business in whether it comes from a dealer, a charity, or an insurance company. Our goal is to say yes and take those cars in, so we\u2019re building out that capacity for the whole organization not just one component of the organization. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : I just wanted to dig a little deeper on some of the answers you\u2019ve given particularly in the yard expense. You\u2019ve obviously been investing a lot and the yard costs was up a lot year-over-year. I know you won\u2019t give us specific numbers, but could you maybe rank the four, or if there\u2019s more tell me more, causes for that growth? New fixed domestic yard costs, new fixed international yard costs, increased sequential inventory growth, and then CAT expenses, can you just rank those in terms of the year-over-year costs in the yard costs? William Franklin : In this quarter, it would be the CAT expenses had the highest impact. Jay Adair : I\u2019d almost view it as you kind of asked on two different plains. On the domestic versus international, must more domestic. On the question of what\u2019s causing growth within the domestic realm, I think it is volume growth broadly with CATs, as Will pointed out, being a meaningful contributor this past quarter. Bob Labick : The CAT theoretically, excluding another CAT next quarter, goes away and the rest of the stuff, obviously depending on inventory and volume growth, will stay? Jay Adair : I just want to jump in there because Will mentioned three major CATs, but we had something like nine CAT events that he mentioned. I would say two things to that. One is we are building out capacity along a number of the coastal states for future CAT situations. The second point is, we don\u2019t think CATs are going away. There\u2019s enough weather and we\u2019re national enough in our footprint that there is something happening, whether it\u2019s in Colorado Springs there\u2019s a hailstorm or it\u2019s a flood in Houston, or it\u2019s tornados in Oklahoma, there\u2019s always something going to be out there. We think the CATs are a regular part of the business and obviously, the smaller the catastrophe the better it is on our margins. The larger the CAT the more negative it is in terms of profitability because of the sheer logistics of moving people in, picking all the vehicles up, the additional costs you have, etcetera. But just so you understand we are thinking about CATs as being a more ongoing part of the company. Bob Labick : Thank you for your commentary on Germany earlier. I also noticed you had some new auctions in Spain, can you talk about that market and then just what you\u2019ve learned in each of those and if there\u2019s other opportunities in continental Europe? Jay Adair : I think they\u2019re very similar. I went to Spain a couple of months ago and as I said, I went to Germany couple of weeks ago and I think they\u2019re very similar in that you have the same problems in Europe that you have in the US. If you\u2019re selling a vehicle and it\u2019s not going into an auction where it\u2019s being stored, you have to deal with the owner of the vehicle, which is the insured, having someone come to their home typically, pick the vehicle up. That experience can be a pretty bad experience.  There could be anywhere from showing up late at night to pick the vehicle up, to wanting to renegotiate the purchase price on the auction platform. We think from that standpoint, less friction. We think from the standpoint of logistically allowing a buyer to buy vehicles and swing in with a nine-car hauler and pick those vehicles up, and all the other benefits that we have provided in the US and the UK, as examples, we think that opportunity welcomes itself in Germany and Spain as well. Obviously, Germany is a much bigger market than Spain. I suppose I\u2019d say it this way, culturally the German market is very willing to test the model and if that model ends up proving to be better, which we believe it will, then they\u2019re committed to moving forward. That\u2019s why at this time we\u2019re doing business in Spain as well as Germany, but there\u2019s more focus right now, on our part, to focus on Germany. You don\u2019t want to be spread out and trying to do multiple countries on something like this. It\u2019s a large market, it\u2019s over half a million vehicles, and we want to make sure that as we test and then move forward with growth plans in Germany that we succeed and so that\u2019s where our efforts are at right now. Bob Labick : One last one. On the last call or the one before that, you talked about a new retail location in Dallas for crash toys, maybe if there\u2019s any update from what you\u2019ve learned from that experience so far? William Franklin : We\u2019ve [inaudible] a new brand and a new facility, it\u2019s called Crash Toys and it\u2019s targeted to raising the returns on non-car assets. It\u2019s basically motorcycles, it\u2019s jet skis, it\u2019s boats, it can be recreational vehicles. By giving it a new brand and new emphasis we\u2019re targeting more retail buyers and we\u2019re doing more marketing behind it. Once again, it\u2019s all in the effort to getting better returns for our insurance customers. We\u2019re happy with the results in Dallas. We\u2019re opening another location in Los Angeles and then we\u2019ll evaluate that and determine what the next steps are afterwards. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from William Armstrong with C. L. King & Associates. WilliamArmstrong: In terms of the CAT cars, the processing costs, could you remind us, are those costs recognized as incurred or as those cars get sold in your auctions? Jay Adair : As incurred. We put very little of the costs on the balance sheet and the reality is, as Jeff has said, that principle holds true even to non-CAT cars. We recognize a portion of our revenue at the time we pick up the car, but that revenue has almost no margin. The majority of our costs associated with the car is at that time we pick it up, we receive it, and we store it. There\u2019s a disproportional recognition of the profitability of that transaction at the time that car is sold versus the time it\u2019s picked up. WilliamArmstrong: Looking at those cars from the Louisiana floods and Hurricane Mathew in particular, are most of those cars already been sold or will you get some of that volume benefit in the current quarter? Jay Adair : We have many cars yet to sell from those CAT events. WilliamArmstrong:  In terms of pricing trends, excluding scrap which you addressed earlier, what sort of average selling pricing trends are we seeing across the board? William Franklin : Within the US I\u2019d characterize them as stable. The offsetting considerations are that scrap has improved, used car prices are flat or up slightly. I think folks had asked about the currency effects, the Peso was certainly down year-over-year which affect the selling prices of cars in the US so we\u2019re approximately flat. Operator : At this time, we have no other questions. Jay Adair : We\u2019re very pleased with the results of the first quarter. Thank you all for attending the call. We look forward to reporting the second quarter in the new year. We wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving. That concludes our call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Shintel. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Copart. With me in the room is Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President and Jeff Liaw, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeff for Safe Harbor and financial review. Will give an update on the company and then we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions after that. With that, Jeff? Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. I\u2019ll start with the Safe Harbor. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses on our cash balances and the adoption of an accounting pronouncement regarding the tax treatment of executive stock option exercises. We\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations\u2019 link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. Now to the second quarter. We continue to base the presentation, consistent with what we showed you for the first quarter with non-GAAP net income adjusted to exclude the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses on cash balances as well as the adoption of accounting pronouncement regarding the tax treatment of stock option exercises. For the cleanest look at the business, we continue to encourage you to focus on revenue, gross profits and operating income measures. I\u2019ll describe in greater detail the currency fluctuations, which affected other income and then in turn net income on a GAAP basis. Starting with the top line, we experience global revenue growth of approximately 17% year-over-year for the second quarter from just under $300 million to just under $350 million in the current quarter. We did experience a detrimental year-over-year currency effect on revenue of approximately $9.5 million. This is due of course primarily to weakness in the British pound relative to the dollar. The pound for the quarter was down 17% year-over-year. We did experience global unit sales growth of 18%, consistent across the United States and as well as our international segment. US unit growth was driven by combination of factors, principally growth through our existing insurance customers due to driving activity in total loss frequency, consistent with themes we've discussed with you in the past as well as account wins and catastrophic weather events. Approximately 3% of our growth was attributable to cat events in the second quarter or for units sold in the second quarter of \u201917 in comparison to the second quarter of \u201816. We grew global inventory at 17.7% year-over-year, a modest portion of this between 1% and 2% is attributable to catastrophic weather events as well. Service revenue growth of 19.1% in comparison to purchase card revenue growth of just $0.2 million is 0.5%, a continuation of the theme we described to you in the past regarding our proactive shift of units away from purchase arrangements to service arrangements when we can so do. We grew gross profit from 124.6 million in the second quarter last year to 146.8 million this year with a slight increase in gross margin from 41.6% to 42%.  A few notes on average selling prices. ASPs were up slightly year-over-year for the second quarter, a function really of a few different things. First is, we did experience year-over-year scrap increases of just shy of 40%. That we cite American recyclers crushed car body index averaging their index across the five regions. The improvement in scrap rates was offset of course by a much stronger United States dollar, which all else equal can reduce selling prices for cars in our US auctions. For example, the USD was nearly 20% stronger this year in this quarter than it was a year ago. Used car value is not a particular driver of change in the quarter. Mannheim\u2019s index indicates plus or minus flat used car values for the two periods.  We did experience an increase in general and administrative expenditures of just over 3 million, $3.3 million ex-D&A. Also, the G&A was down sequentially versus the prior quarter. We incurred certain adjustments for certain indirect tax expenses, also experienced some modest increases in professional services expenses. Regarding D&A within the general and administrative expenditures, our increases were due primarily due to assets in information technologies that were placed into service as well as changes to certain useful lives for our technology. As we continue to say, G&A will continue to grow on an absolute dollar basis as the size of our business, the complexity of our business increases over time, though with reasonable top line growth rates, we expect to continue to achieve operating leverage. We experienced EBIT growth of just over 18%, growing from $92.1 million for the second quarter last year to $108.9 million this year. That\u2019s despite a currency related drag of approximately $2.9 million for the quarter due again to weakness in the British pound. Our net interest expense for the quarter was up slightly from 5 million to 5.8 million due to a higher funded debt balance offset by somewhat lower drawn rates. The other income line includes a loss of $3 million, largely due to currency fluctuations on our cash balances. A year ago, other income was a positive $4.4 million also due to the same currency fluctuations.  GAAP net income for the period grew at 12% from 59 million to 66.1 million. Non-GAAP net income, which I will walk you through in a little bit greater detail, grew from 55.5 million to 67.4 million this year, growth of 21.6%. The non-GAAP net income excludes after-tax foreign currency related losses of 2.7 million in this current quarter and reverses as well the prior year gain of 3.5 million. So that line item alone is a $6 million unfavorable swing, which is adjusted for in our non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income also excludes the book tax effects of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 regarding the GAAP tax treatment of stock option exercises. Our year-over-year share count has decreased due largely to share buybacks, including the effective share buybacks from tax withholdings for executive option exercises. On balance then, our non-GAAP EPS grew at 29% year-over-year for the second quarter.  Let's turn our attention to the balance sheet as well as the cash flow statement. A few highlights on cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $81 million, a function of increased EBIT, offset by AR growth with accounts receivable consuming $45 million of cash. You know already that the accounts receivables are primarily advanced charges paid out on behalf of our customers when a lot is picked up. So our accounts receivable tends to grow with the inventory that we have in our yards. We did experience a $32 million reduction in deferred and current income taxes. You may remember from the prior call that we incurred a large tax bill in effect regarding the stock option exercises by our executives, which effectively prepaid the majority of our federal income taxes for this fiscal year. This $32 million reduction is that cash benefits coming to fruition in the second quarter.  The second quarter, as you know, is customarily the quarter in which we build inventory, which was the case again this year. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million, of which approximately 80% is for land development and lease buyouts. Our diluted shares outstanding again decreased from a little north of 124 million to 117.8 million due largely to share buybacks, including open market purchases as well as the effective buybacks for tax withholdings. With that, I'll turn it over to our Executive Vice President, Will Franklin. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019d like to add a few more brief comments and we'll turn it over for Q&A. The story for the quarter for both North America and the UK is a continuation of the growth in volume, driven by market wins, by organic growth within the market and by expansion of our non-insurance businesses. In North America, sales volume was up 18.4% over the same quarter last year and 34% over the same quarter two years ago. In the UK, we have similar trends, with volume up 15.4% and 27.5% over the same quarters of fiscal \u201916 and fiscal \u201815. In both North America and the UK, drivers of organic growth are the same and consistent with prior discussions that we've had in this call. We are seeing increases in the car park, increases in acts of frequency and of most importance, increases in salvage frequency. In North America, revenue grew 20.5%, which outpaced volume growth as revenue per car increased marginally due to higher ASPs and the performance of additional services. While non-insurance volume grew, as a percentage of total volume, it declined from 19.8% to 17.8%. Growth in non-insurance volume came primarily from additional dealer cars. Accommodating the tremendous growth in North America volume, while at the same time ensuring that we continue to provide the best service to our sellers and our members has presented opportunities to our operations and our facilities teams. Our facilities teams have been successful in obtaining additional capacity in very difficult environments. Over the course of the last few years, we have noted the increasing difficulty and the increase in expense of attaining new storage capacity. In the US, during the 4.5 year period ending Q2 of 2016, we opened only three Greenfield yards. In the last four quarters alone, we have announced and opened 10 new Greenfield yards. In addition, we have opened 10 sub-lots and expanded 16 existing facilities. During the current quarter alone, we opened five yards, six sublots and expanded five existing locations, increasing capacity by 463 acres. Even with these additions and expansions, we will need more land to address the expected future growth and to be better prepared to address the sudden storage demands created by catastrophes. Last week, we opened a 162 acre site in [indiscernible], Florida. This site will not be operated as a standalone yard at this time, but will serve as standby storage capacity, ready for immediate access should a cat occur in the Miami, Tampa, or Orlando, Florida areas. A similar strategy has been implemented in North Florida, Louisiana, Georgia and North and South Carolina and has been rolled out in other cat regions. In the UK and expressed in pounds, our revenue was up 15.5%, very consistent with UK volume growth. In addition to growth in the insurance market, the non-insurance volume increased by over 36%. And as a percentage of total volume, non-insurance cars grew from 15.4% to 18.2%. However, the change in the pound to USD exchange rate has a severe impact on UK revenue of over $10 million and resulted in a recognized decline in UK revenue expressed in dollars of 3.5%. Overall, our growth of revenue of 16.6% was slightly below our growth in volume of 18.3%, primarily due to the detrimental quarter-over-quarter change in the foreign currency exchange rates. At the end of the quarter, our North America and our UK inventories were up 19.1% and 4.1% respectively. Global inventory was up 17.7%. On a consolidated basis, our average cost to process each car increased marginally over the same quarter last year. In normal environments, increased volume yields reductions in average cost to process a car due to greater fixed cost absorption. However, in the current environment, new volume was frequently addressed with new capacity, not idle existing capacity. Further, we incurred extraordinary operating costs associated with temporary leases, additional trucking to move cars between locations after hours and with staffing that was well in excess of our normal operating models. We remain focused on G&A expense and are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by controlling this growth. While we saw a spike this quarter, a result of primarily from unique expenses and we expect G&A expense to continue to decline as a percentage of revenue.  Now, let me conclude with a final comment. In a business the nature of Copart, in which land very specific in nature and very difficult to find, is required and where scale is achieved through the construction of new facilities that can take 12 to 24 months, it's very difficult to maintain operational leverage with worldwide growth volume of 33.6% over the last two years and 18.3% over the last 12 months. Yet, in this environment, we expanded our EBIT margin by 210 basis points over Q2 of \u201915 and 50 bps over Q2 of \u201816. And we expect to see better operational leverage as we begin to complete our facilities expansion and to process volume growth through the excess capacity that we are currently creating.  That concludes my comments. Shintel, we\u2019ll turn the call over to you to manage the Q&A portion of it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. This is actually Robert in for Bob today. Can you update us on capacity additions as how many acres you\u2019ve added and how many more are to come? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. It depends on what period you\u2019re talking about. We have on our board over 60 expansion targets that we're looking at and that's worldwide. And it's impossible to predict exactly the number of acres that those efforts will yield or the timing of those efforts, because like I said in my remarks, it's very difficult to get a contract on new land. I would expect to be in the high hundreds of acres within the next 24 months. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. And are you able to quantify cat cost in the quarter? Jeff Liaw : No, not specifically. We still did have remaining cat costs, we did process between 8000 and 10000 cat cars during the quarter. But the cat wasn\u2019t the sold driver of the increase in costs. It was just the overall volume that affects at almost every yard. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And can you provide any update on Germany and Spain, with auctions taking place there I guess really today. What are you learning there? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. So the auctions are test in nature and the results have been very promising. The auctions are yielding returns that are much higher than the current process employed. What we\u2019re also understanding is that we need to have a broader footprint in yards to be able to offer this to the insurance companies in Germany. And so we\u2019re somewhat subject to the pace of the expansion of those yards. Currently, we have seven yards that we\u2019re targeting to open, one which has already been opened. That's at Homburg. We have four other yards that we\u2019re negotiated contracts on and the two that we're still addressing the zoning issues. So like I said, the roll out in Germany is somewhat subject to our ability to open those yards. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And just lastly from me. Typically, how long does it take for new yards to reach mature margins? Jeff Liaw : There's no one any one yard that\u2019s -- they're all different. They're all snowflakes. It depends on how much deposit you can shift from other yards. They can be as short as a year and it can be as long as three or four years. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens and Company. Ben Bienvenu : Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm curious, you highlighted some of the FX headwinds on the revenue from a translational perspective. Are you -- your volume growth and inventory builds continue to be really strong. I'm curious are you seeing any implications or dampened appetite from a strong dollar from your foreign buyers\u2019 appetite to buy vehicles at auctions? Will Franklin : So Ben, I think what I heard you, as it probably relates to relatively unconnected concepts. The first is that we continue to experience meaningful inventory growth and volume growth and that's a reflection of the factors we've talked about really for a while now regarding driving activity, accident rates and total loss frequency. That appears to be continuing unabated as far as we can tell. The second question you raised, which is the foreign currency effect on our foreign buyers. I mentioned that in my comments as well. That certainly affect the average selling prices for our vehicles. On balance, we\u2019re still flat or up slightly year-over-year. There are a handful of things to go into that -- that contribute to the question of ASPs, of which foreign currency is one. The others are scrap, used car values, mix, et cetera. But all else equal, certainly, the US dollar being 20% stronger year-over-year versus the Mexican peso for the second quarter does affect ASPs. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Thanks. And then you highlighted your recent capacity additions in cat prone geographies. We've seen more flooding in California. I'm curious how has the additional capacity that you've brought online better positioned you in those markets and can you give us any sense of what kind of volume is being generated as a function of some of the recent flooding activity we\u2019ve seen in our West? Jeff Liaw : No. In respect to the last question, we really can't give you any kind of guidance on the volume that we\u2019ll generate. We have opened up two new yards in Southern California, which I don't know what we do without those. We also have sublots in the high desert area. So when I talked about the additional cost, what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll use some of the yards in Southern California as marshalling yards. We\u2019ll bring the cars in during the day and during the night, we\u2019ll load those up on car haulers and we\u2019ll take them up to our sublots, up in Palmdale which once again significantly as to the cost of processing the cars. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman, JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you please remind us of the drivers of the seasonal leverage of yard and expense cost as a percentage of revenue as we walk you\u2019re your fiscal second to fiscal third quarter. The last couple of years, you appeared to have leverage these expenses, 13 bps, 300 bps, maybe. Should we expect that type of leverage to repeat this year, benefiting margin again? Jeff Liaw : Ryan, as a general matter, we don\u2019t provide forward guidance, but let me provide what I think could be relevant color. So when we received a unit, we incur the majority of the expenses. We however don't recognize most of the revenue until we sell it. So depending on whether the receipt of a given unit crosses - receipt and sale of that unit crosses the reporting period that can cause us to incur the expenses upfront and not recognize the revenue - most of the revenue until later. This is all a function of course of GAAP guidelines. And so in a period like the second quarter in which we received many more units than we sell. We have borne a substantial portion of the costs already for which the units will be sold later. That can explain some of the seasonal fluctuations in our gross margin rate. Ryan Brinkman : And then just when you talk about insurance versus non-insurance cars. You're not really talking about salvage versus whole car right, because I think a large portion of your non-insurance cars are actually like non-insured salvage cars picked up from junkyards is that the case and I ask because I've gotten some questions today about how you might be negatively impacted by some of the headwinds that car auction service has discussed regarding if you are dealer consignment sales on the whole car side. And I didn't think you had much exposure there. Are you able to say how large cope our dealer service is now as a percent of your total business? Jeff Liaw : Now I don't really want to express as a percentage but I will tell you that most of our non-insurance cars are truly non-insurance cars. They're not salvage cars that came to us through an owner retain process. Ryan Brinkman : So there is some fair amount of exposure there? Jeff Liaw : Tell me what you mean by exposure? Ryan Brinkman : I don\u2019t know, 10% of your unit volume, I don't know. Jay Adair : I\u2019m going to jump in, because are you \u2013 I want to make sure I understand the question or we understand the question Are you stating that they are referring to dealer auctions as having slower dealer consignments. Ryan Brinkman : That's right on the whole car side there's fewer dealer consignment sales and I was just wondering is there in - well some clients are on it. Is there implication for your volume from that, how to think about, I think it's small, how to think about the magnitude of your exposure to whole cars being sold by dealers because I know you had that co-part dealer services business you launched a while back? Jeff Liaw : We won't provide a percentage. We will tell you this that in the last three quarters that number has been growing. Ryan Brinkman : Growing? Okay so maybe that's one of the reasons [indiscernible]. Just last question on the opportunity to repatriate cash back to the US if tax laws really change. Is that material enough of an opportunity to drive any different capital allocation decision or would you even look to because you need to invest organically in Germany or pursue other inorganic growth overseas? Jay Adair : Hey Ryan, Jay here. The guys can answer that question. I just want to jump in on this point that you're making about the consignment. They are two very different types of cars and we've got a dealer consignment in the whole car and a lot of those vehicles are coming from franchise dealerships and we've got a dealer consignment in our world, most of those are coming from non-franchise dealerships. So they're really not comparative cars and then to Will's point, besides the fact that that segment is growing to Will's point all non-insurance then we start to look at institutions and charities and other companies that assign products and they have absolutely nothing to do with trade ins or insurance. Jeff Liaw : And Ryan to your next question then about cash repatriation. As you know the majority of our cash is actually held in non-US accounts. Our expectations are to invest and deploy that capital outside the US. If there is a substantial change to the tax code here in the US, we of course would reevaluate and consider those parameters as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Matthew Paige, Gabelli & Company. Matthew Paige : As you speak about gaining additional capacity, in the past you've mentioned also moving into adjacent markets as potential areas of interest, is it still the case and where does that fit on your list of priorities? Will Franklin : And what do you mean by adjacent? Matthew Paige : Like equipment, equipment options or even in more car auction? Will Franklin : The investments you've heard us talk about today are for our core business hard stop as for considering our strength and strategic capabilities and whether they would enable us to extend our franchise into other spaces that's something we consider over the long term, but nothing you've heard us talk about today is relevant for that consideration. Jay Adair : Let me just add to that, we keep waiting or expecting this trend of growth to subside in salvage cars and I just get the most recent numbers from ISS, Independent Statistical Service, which is a information provider to mostly insurance industry. In the last quarter they provided information which was third quarter of last year. Salvage frequency actually went up, we've been expecting that to go down. In terms of total claims, on a year over year basis up 3.5% but in total paid losses it was up 10%. And if you look back 24 months, claims were up 8%, the total paid losses was up 20%. And that's kind of the basis for the increase in the salvage frequency. The cost of repair is growing, accident frequency is growing and so we're very comfortable with our expansion process as needed to address this expected volume. Matthew Paige : And my second question it for Jeff; you\u2019re now been with the company for a little over a year. Has there anything that surprised you or [indiscernible]. Jeff Liaw : I think of course before you join a company you just understand so much less about it and what I was able to see from the outside of course respected and admired from afar and now that I'm plugged in and appreciate the complexity of the business and how hard it is to manage the network of facilities, the buyers while providing outstanding service to sellers including in cash often times. I think I have a better appreciation for just how hard it is to do what we do. But in terms of co-part, no meaningful surprises. I did spend a lot of time with Jay and Will and others before joining the company. So it's been relatively smooth sailing. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Is there a way to think about capacity utilization I mean obviously you\u2019ve added a fair amount of acreage in the last twelve months and you're adding a fair amount more? And it sounded like maybe your utilization was too high to be efficient previously but is there a way that we should be thinking about this relative to the cycle as well because obviously we're having a pretty strong inflow of volume, is there a point at which you have acreage that would become inefficient if we had a slowed down. I guess how to do the math around the incremental real estate decision. Jeff Liaw : Well first off the conversations around expansion aren\u2019t that broad, they\u2019re generally fairly narrow in terms of geographical regions. So we can\u2019t look at our total capacity nationwide. And there's a lot of factors of enter into what our targets are for the capacity that we need. We\u2019ve even come with a - come up with a - recognized a new phenomenon that is certain yards are actually get less efficient in their size and we get yards at [indiscernible] cars are actually less efficient than the smaller yards, so that\u2019s also part of the consideration. I think the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen is that previously we tried to operate our yards at 100 or over 100% capacity during the peak season. And now we decided that that\u2019s that creates too much risk for our sellers. And we changed model to now we're targeting 85% of capacity during the peak season and 70% of capacity in those areas that are subject to cats. And without answering your question specifically because I\u2019m not sure how to, these are the drivers that we look at when we were doing - going through our expansion processes. Bret Jordan : And then one question on market share, obviously there was one insurance company that shifted some share to you guys a year ago. Is anything else changing out there or is there anything in the pipeline as far as major RFP activity as we look out? Will Franklin : There's always RFP activity in - we compete very aggressively with every other player in the industry. We think we've done very well in the last couple years and it is impossible to predict what the next couple years will look like. Operator : Our next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki, Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : Just a question on operating leverage and efficiency here. Is there a good rule of thumb for the level of ideal revenue growth you would need in order to achieve operating leverage with the capacity you have in place now because it seems like that volume growth is too high you have to add capacity which is costly but obviously if it too low you can\u2019t leverage your fixed costs, so you know what do you think is the sweet spot there for volume growth? Jay Adair : Without a lot of analytics behind it I would say 8% would be really nice that gives us time to like I said it takes a couple years to get to acquire new capacity that gives us - that would afford us time to do so, especially for operating at 85% capacity based on current volume. Jeff Liaw : Elizabeth, I\u2019d say that growth is affirmatively good for us and ultimately the more we grow the more we achieve operating leverage over the long term. I think we can create near term noise is surprises or volatility. And if you told me we for sure grow it at 15% a year forever. We can plan accordingly, hire accordingly, build land accordingly et cetera. Is that there is some natural volatility in any industry including ours that they can create spikes if we suddenly have catastrophic weather events and a really busy summer that can cause over time excess of all expenses et cetera. If you had perfect visibility which we will never have and robust growth that would of course be ideal. Elizabeth Suzuki : And then just looking at the potential for tax reform, CAR mentioned today that they think a 1% reduction in the US corporate tax rate would be about $4 million benefit to their net income, have you done any similar sensitivity analysis, obviously there could be a lot of moving parts, interest deducibility and other nuance but just assuming a straight reduction in US corporate rate how much of a benefit do you think that would be for Copart? Jeff Liaw : A good question Elizabeth and I think we're not prepared to comment quite as specifically as they did. I would say when we look at the various pillars of the corporate tax reform being contemplated today. Big picture that affects both your taxable income so the base upon which taxes are calculated as well as the rates, we\u2019re relatively unaffected on the base side of the equation. We have interests but we're relatively unlevered so we're not affected much by interest deducibility considerations. We do invest capital so to the extent that we are permitted to deduct those expenditures right away that could in fact reduce our base. So I think the base for which taxes are calculated is relatively unaffected. We are substantially US cash tax payers however. So if the rate changes that likely does accrue to our benefit. And as that crystallizes and becomes more real we'll certainly have more specific things to say about it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Couple of questions here, in terms of the GAAP tax rate going forward, what should we use, my model I'm looking at from last quarter I think we [indiscernible] something around 36%. It looks like it came in at 34% this quarter. So what kind of number should we be using on a go forward basis. Jeff Liaw : So setting aside the topic we just talked about right, which is a more radical overhaul to the tax code. I think probably four to six quarters ago we generally expect 35% to 36% effective rates and that's still the right long term starting point. Gary Prestopino : And then I couldn\u2019t write down fast enough Will, you gave a breakdown of what the global inventory growth was in the UK and US. Could you just repeat that? Will Franklin : Sure. Global was 17.7% and then on a regional basis, North America was 19.1% and the UK was 4.1%. Gary Prestopino : In terms of the temporary standby storage sites that you're putting up, land is land obviously, it\u2019s going to cause you to do that but in terms of capital improvements, putting facilities there, do you have to do a lot there besides maybe just putting a fence around the land and maybe putting some gravel there. I mean you need to staff it, do you need have a physical building on the site. Will Franklin : We do not and in our strategy we won\u2019t do much to these. So every yard is unique. The question whether we sense it even one that\u2019s subject to discussion. If we don't fancy that means in times of use we need to have security. So then it\u2019s just a math equation of how many times do you think you\u2019ll use it, needs security versus the cost of the fence. Generally in these temporary locations, they\u2019re not temporary, but the standby locations will put in roads or rock some roads and that's about it. So beyond the cost of the land here's very little capital necessary to put them in a standby state. Gary Prestopino : And then the last question as it pertains to what you're doing in Germany. My understanding of that cars were basically owner retained in Germany. So is there prior to doing these auctions and continuing on is there still some time an educational process that you have to do with the insurance companies to get them to understand just what you're doing to get them to want to pool the cars and obviously you've got to get a buyer base as well right? Will Franklin : We have a buyer base. And now I don't think there's really any educational process yet to take place. I think that they are aware of the value that we provide and I think they're anxious to be able to utilize that value. The whole back is moving one region in the country - one area of the country which is not attractive to the larger insurance companies. This is a complete change occurred onto them and a change of process, they'd rather not have two processes ongoing at one time. And therefore there they'd like to see our ability to handle their volume more broadly within the country. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Well this is just a follow up to your ISS data. If you could throw that out again the salvage frequency versus total claims and I guess, is ISS using the similar data that CCC uses from an industry standpoint as they report repairable claims growth? Will Franklin : I believe it is and this doesn't provide salvage frequency, it provides the drivers to that decision. And so this is more focused on the accident frequency. So the numbers I cited were that the number of paid claims on a year over year basis and this is based on the third quarter of last calendar year, we\u2019re up 3.5%. And on a two year period we're up almost 8%. While at the same time, the paid losses were up 10 and 20%. And I guess I\u2019d note that accident frequency was [indiscernible] first time, I only go back to 2011, it\u2019s never been 6%. So the accident avoidance systems and some of the new technologies isn't being demonstrated in the numbers at least at this point. Bret Jordan : Smartphones are beating accident avoidance technology. So this takeaway here is claims, the percentage of claims that are losses are increasing as a percentage of crashes. Will Franklin : That's correct. Operator : At this time we have no further questions in the queue. Jay Adair : I would just add some closing remarks from listening to some of the questions. One is that you may want to look into the use of adapter headlights and the multiple component bumpers today that exist in the market. There's plenty of research out there that you can find named off CCC and some of the other sources that are out there but there's no doubt that bumper covers being three components and now being 15 components and all the complexity in headlights. Headlights are now as high as $5000 for a headlight coming from the days when they were less than $100. So we're seeing some big increases there. You may want to research on some of the carriers as well because they're reporting that in their claims costs and why their claims costs are up because of that. That increase in cost is increasing severity and that's severity going up causes total loss frequency or salvage frequency as we call it to go up. The other thing that I'm not sure that the analyst maybe understand it, but not positively you fully understand it is this cost that we have associated with building yards and asking questions about what would be normal. Right now we've got people in advance of all this growth that are finding locations developing locations and it takes a number of resources to do that and then once those yards already we've got a staff and turn them on completely before we ever assign one car. And so you've got all this cost when you go from adding I think Will stated three locations over four years to ten locations this year and we believe we\u2019ll open up in addition in the calendar year we\u2019re in another plus ten or more. So there's a lot of costs that\u2019s associated with that and then once we start to see some normalcy in total loss frequency and the total losses that are coming in, those yards will have access capacity. So we don't build those yards for 85% capacity, we'll build those yards for 30% or 40% utilization and a much higher number of capacity so they have room to grow into that. As Will stated we want to operate the company at 85% on average for our location. So these new stores are being built, these new yards are being built with significantly more capacity than that. And so that you're going to see some of these costs and then finally I would just mention in additional that was the towing component that Will outlined, it could be a pretty significant component when you're out of space in a market, you may have to shuttle cars. And we've had a few scenarios like that and we're okay with that that we're handling those cars, we\u2019re moving them to areas where we have room and then we expand all that cost goes away. So we look at all of this as upside, we're getting a lot of volume in the history of my career I've not seen where the volume increases like this and then goes the other direction. So at some point this may start to shrink, as Jeff stated we don't see that currently but at the point that we start to see volume normalize we don't think it goes into a negative situation. So we slow down at that point, the adding of yards, we slow down the expansion of facilities and we process those vehicles as incremental units. So that was it, just want to add that color and thank you all for attending the call and we look forward to reporting third quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

King Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding. We now have your speakers in conference. Please be aware, that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of today's presentation, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow, if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Jay Adair. Sir, you may begin. Jay Adair : Thanks so much. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Third Quarter Call for Copart Fiscal 2017. On the call today is Jeff Liaw, our Chief Financial Officer; and Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, our CFO. After the formal presentation, we will open it up for questions. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. I will start with our Safe Harbor. During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses on our cash balances and the adoption of an accounting pronouncement regarding the tax treatment of executive stock option exercises. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our web site under the Investor Relations' link and in our press release issued yesterday afternoon. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the Management's Discussion and Analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. Regarding the third quarter fiscal year for Copart, our presentation will be on the same basis as the second quarter, with the non-GAAP adjustments as described previously. For a representative snapshot of the business, we always recommend focusing on revenue, gross profits and operating income measures. Third quarter represented record financial performance for Copart in terms of our units volumes, revenue, gross profit and operating income. Starting with the top line, we experienced global revenue growth of 7.7%, this includes the detrimental year-over-year currency effect on our revenue of approximately $7.4 million from our foreign operations, primarily due to weakness in the British pound, which declined over that same period, approximately 12%. We experienced global unit sales growth of 8.6% with U.S. unit growth of 8.7 and international unit growth of 8.5. U.S. unit growth in particular, has been driven both by market driven growth within existing customers, as well as wins; new territory wins among existing customers as well as new customer acquisitions. There were no substantial effects from catastrophic weather events on our unit sales in the quarter. We experienced global inventory growth of 7.9%, excluding catastrophic inventory from both periods, inventory growth would have been just north of 10% at 10.3%. Service revenue growth for us of $28.8 million year-over-year, that's 9.5% growth compared to purchase power revenue decline of $2.2 million or 5.1%, a function of our ongoing shift of principle units to agency arrangements. Our gross profit grew from $157.6 million to $172.5 million, with an increase in gross margins from 45.4 to 46.1. A handful of factors worth describing, we experienced a modest improvement or increase in average selling prices year-over-year of approximately 4% in the U.S., largely due to increased ASPs among our sellers. It's also in part, a reflection of scrap and higher ACV value cars. Year-over-year scrap for third quarter was up just north of 45% from $125 per ton to $183. Our sources again are the American Recycler Magazine, they provide regional data across five regions. We average that data over the three month period in the quarter. Higher scrap values were offset again by a stronger U.S. dollar, which all else equal, would reduce selling prices for our cars and our U.S. auctions. For example, the U.S. dollar is approximately 8% stronger versus the Mexican Peso in this third quarter versus the third quarter of 2016. Year-over-year used car values remained flat, up slightly based on the Mannheim index. Our general and administrative expenses were up slightly from $31.7 million to $32.5 million, ex. D&A. As a reminder, long term, we continue to expect our G&A to grow for us to also generate operating leverage on top of G&A, but to expect G&A to grow with both inflation and increasing complexity in the business. EBIT for the business was up 12.2% from $121.9 million to $136.8 million; that includes the detrimental currency related effect of approximately $2.3 million, again due to weakness in the British Pound. Net interest expense for the quarter was flat from $5.4 million to $5.5 million, due to a higher funded debt balance, but offset by lower drawn rates, in connection with our financing amendments of last year. GAAP net income grew at 21.3% from $74.6 million, through $90.5 million. Non-GAAP net income, which adjusts for the book tax effect of executive stock options exercises, in connection with our adoption of accounting pronouncements, grew from $74.5 million to $86.4 million, growth of 16%. Our year-over-year share count was approximately flat on a non-GAAP basis from $234.6 million to $235.4 million, therefore, we experienced an approximate 16% increase in non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share. We will turn our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, a few cash flow highlights. Operating cash flow for the quarter, was $192.2 million compared to $124.4 million a year ago, due to increased earnings, a larger release of working capital due to higher sales. As you recall, our accounts receivable, primarily accounts for advance charges paid up on behalf of suppliers when we pick up loss, so AR will move as we pick up inventory, will decline as we sell. We experienced also a $35.9 million reduction in deferred and current income taxes. This, you will recall, is the offsetting benefits to a large cash tax burden in the first quarter, due to executive stock option exercises. The third quarter is typically our highest cash flow generation, just given the natural seasonality in the business. On the use of cash side of the ledger, we expended capital expenditures of $32.3 million, of which approximately three quarters is for land development and lease buyouts, consistent with our recent past. We also invested $10 million this quarter to acquire Bright Excavation, which enhances our capabilities, in particular, regarding internal land development, which has been a meaningful strategic priority for us. With that, I will turn it over to our Executive Vice President, Will Franklin. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me add a little color before we turn it over to the Q&A session. Once again, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our consolidate growth and revenue of 7.7% was driven by increased volume of 8.6%. In the United States, sales volume was up 8.7% and was driven by organic growth and market wins from the salvage market, as well as continued growth in a non-salvage business, which grew 8.1% and represented 17% of our total volume. Since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, our average quarterly volume growth has been 12.2%, and while we see quarterly fluctuations due to weather events, business days and changes in cycle times, we see industry dynamics as a support to continued growth. In the U.S., we also saw marginal increase in revenue per car, as ASPs increased. This is due to a reduction in charity cars as a percentage of our total cars sold, and as Jeff has already mentioned, growth in scrap metal pricing as well as increase in the pre-accident value of the cars assigned to us by the insurance companies. We continue our efforts to develop our international buyer base, despite the challenges caused by the strong dollar. In the quarter, almost 20% of our units were sold to international buyers, which is higher than the same quarter of 2015. In this fiscal year, we saw buyers join us from Indonesia, Cyprus and Bosnia, and we saw growth in volume from buyers in countries like Nigeria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia and Ukraine. In total, we sell in over 114 countries. For the quarter, our international operations outside the U.K. remain immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. So we will discuss only U.K., where volume increased 4.1%. The volume was affected by our decision to move away from less profitable, non-insurance volume, and which resulted in growth in EBIT on a local currency basis of 11.7%. In the U.K., 18.1% of our volume comes from non-insurance suppliers. At the end of our quarter, our U.S. inventory was up 8% and global inventory was up 7.9%. Excluding the impact of cat volume in the third quarter of last year, U.S. inventory was up 10.8%. On a consolidated basis, our average cost to process each car remained consistent with the same quarter last year. In a normal environment, we expect the increased volume to yield reductions in average processing costs, due to higher fixed cost absorption. However in the current environment, new volume was frequently handled with new capacity, not idle existing capacity. Further, we incurred extra operating costs associated with temporary leases. Additional trucking to move cars between locations after hours and with staffing that was well in excess of our normal operating models. Despite operating in a challenging environment, we increased our gross margin by 70 basis points. We remain focused on G&A expense and we are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by controlling this growth. Total expenses were very consistent with prior quarter and same quarter last year, despite the increase in both volume and the number of yards. On a consolidated basis, the stronger dollar and the negative impact on revenue and EBIT of 7.4 and $2.3 million respectively. During the quarter, we continued our facilities' expansion activity, announcing the opening of six new yards. In the U.S., we opened yards in Ogden, Utah; Long Beach, California; Alorton, Illinois, which serves the St. Louis Area; and a 162 acre site in Okeechobee, Florida. The Okeechobee site will not be operated as a standalone yard this time, but will serve a standby storage capacity for cats in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando areas. Additionally, we opened a yard in Newbury, England, which is about 60 miles west of London, and which brings our total number of yards in the U.K. to 16. And a yard in Betim, Brazil, in the state of Minais Gerais; bringing the total number of yards in Brazil to six. In addition, we had 20 acre expansion in San Jose, California. In total we had over 300 acres of capacity to our network. Year-to-date, we have announced opening of 12 new yards and seven major expansions, totaling almost 600 acres. Our expansion activity will continue, as we believe industry trends will drive future volume growth. That concludes my comments. Brandon, we will now turn the call back over to you for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Bob Labick : Good morning. Will Franklin : Hey Bob. Jay Adair : Good morning. Bob Labick : Hi. Wanted to start up, just following-up on Will's comments at the end there. You clearly have been growing very rapidly and adding a lot of land. It sounds like you have run into a bit of constraints with the volume that you have had and that's why you are adding over the same. Have you been able, for the most part to stay ahead of the curve, how much more land do you have to add, and just talk a little bit about the process of adding land ahead of the volume and how you coordinated it all? Because I know it takes a long time to get the land and permits and etcetera. Will Franklin : Bob, I think we have done a very good job in staying ahead of the demand, and as you mentioned, it's a very challenging exercise, primarily because of the zoning, but also in some areas, because of the costs. I mean, the per acre cost in Miami is over $1 million. I think the last time we looked, it was $1.2 million an acre, in the South Bay, San Francisco, it was $1.7 million an acre. Sometimes you can't solve the problem with money, because zoning is very-very difficult to obtain. So we have, like we have said before, a team that does nothing, but that searches for these sites, and a legal team that does nothing but negotiate the contracts and tries to get them secured. We think the growth in volume will continue. We see the drivers of the volume continuing, and in some cases, maybe even accelerating. So we anticipate this activity at this level will continue for at least another 24 months. Jay Adair : And Bob, I think it's fair to think about our land acquisition program, broadly speaking, in three different ways. It's a strategic matter for us, it's taxable and it's also opportunistic. But to say it plainly, having capacity is critical to our providing the kind of excellent customer service that our clients are accustomed to, so we are very proactive in staying ahead of the curve. So you heard us announce a while ago, the acquisition of a large plot of land in Florida, which is both relevant for day-to-day capacity, but especially for catastrophic events, so we want to be ahead of the curve, five, 10, 15 years out. It's also tactical, we know yard-by-yard where we experienced congestion, so we are especially aggressive in targeting those areas. And finally, it's opportunistic, so there are moments when plots of land are available, that they otherwise might not be. We talked extensively about the Los Angeles area being a part of the country we pursued for decades, but we acquired a major plot of land last year, because the right moment in time struck. So it's really all three for us. It's very long term and it's also very opportunistic at the same time. Land, as we talked about before, is episodic in nature. You can't say, I will spend X million dollars this quarter, I will spend Y next quarter, because those transactions aren't always under our immediate control. But suffice it to say, we are happy with where we are, but also know that we will continue to invest aggressively, as Will just articulated. Bob Labick : Okay, great. And then just continuing that thought. Obviously, we agree that there should be continued growth in volume from everything we have read and it could even stay at these very high levels and keep growing. In addition to buying land, what else are you doing to deal with and prepare for the greater volumes at your existing facilities? Jay Adair : That's a primary concern for us Bob. I think the rest of our business scaled very nicely. I mean, we have got a tremendous management team, especially at the GM level that we can port to new facilities. We have technology that expands very easily. So when we address the issues that surround our expansion and increasing volume is primarily focused on lands and land acquisition. Bob Labick : Got it. Great. And then my last one, and I will get back in queue, I promise. Just asking for the quarterly update on Western Europe, Germany and Spain in particular, anything new in the last few months since we have talked, that would suggest either a faster or slower roll out than you previously thought? I know it's an undefined timeframe to get moving, but is there any new events there or how is it going and what's the progress? Jay Adair : Well I don't think we ever actually laid out a time table, other than to say that the discussions are taking place at a number of different levels and the results are encouraging. And I think the best evidence of our confidence is our initiative to buy seven new facilities in Germany. Bob Labick : Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much. Jay Adair : Thanks Bob. Will Franklin : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Will, I think you mentioned that you had downsized your non-insurance activity in the U.K.? Could you add a little more color to that decision and give us some feel for how that might shake out down the road? Will Franklin : Yeah. We have two efforts on the non-insurance side in the U.K., one is similar to our CDS, where we are selling as agents or dealerships and institutional sellers. And the others, we are actually buying and selling cars from account [ph]. And it's the latter which we have made some acquisitions, some purchases that were less profitable than we desired. And so we are just prudent in our buying activity, which decreased our margin, but certainly helped our -- decreased our revenue, but -- volumes and increased our margin percentage. Craig Kennison : And should we expect, for the next three quarters, for that trend to persist on a year-over-year basis, as we look at revenue growth? Will Franklin : The trends being a reduction in non-salvage? Craig Kennison : Yes. Will Franklin : Volume? U.K.? No, I think we have right-sized it, so I don't think any more adjustments are necessary. But I mean, like I said in my initial comments, there is always fluctuations and influences that impact our volume on a quarterly basis. We look at things on more of a long term basis. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then a question for you Jay; with the additional physical capacity you have added recently, what are you doing on the human capital side to run these operations? I don't think you have had to recruit as aggressively as you may be recruiting now? Jay Adair : Yeah. Last year we added 20% to the company in terms of operating employees. So I think the number was 500 new employees in the field. So we have upped -- I mean, it's a good point. We have upped our recruiting efforts in the field -- as you have seen with G&A, we have been able to hold that pretty steady for the year, which has been nice. So there has been some leverage there. And we will continue -- as we are opening yards in advance of volume, you will have a period where you continue to hire more aggressive rate and then, as you fill those yards, you will get some leverage. But we have done a great job. We are happy with where we are at, and the operations team continue to stay ahead of the ball, so we are happy with that. Craig Kennison : And as a final follow-up to that, I know you have invested in some excess capacity to handle catastrophes when they arise. How do you plan to change your human capital, as it relates to catastrophes? Do you have to add temporary labor, or do you just shift it around the country, as you have done in the past? Jay Adair : Yeah. We have got a team of special ops folks, that have already identified themselves and let us know they are willing in a cat situation to spend multiple weeks on the road in affected areas. We have got plenty of people that have signed up for that. So last year -- do you remember the number, was it seven cats, nine cats, I mean, that we had last year? Will Franklin : There were four major cats. Jay Adair : Four major cats, and then -- Will Franklin : And several small. Jay Adair : Several small. Okay. At one point, I do remember us having three different teams deployed for cat situations. And the point I was simply making, Craig, is it was a very busy cat year -- busier than normal. So one never knows how busy it's going to be this year and in future years, but we were more than prepared last year, and I am very confidence that we are prepared for our customers, as we sit today. Will Franklin : Let me add another comment to that; so one of the concerns when a cat situation arises, is our ability to get transportation and sub-hauling capacity. And for that reason, we actually developed our own internal fleet of 50 trucks. So that in a cat situation, we are not negotiating with others or bartering with others to get volume, we can dedicate our own volume to that area to address the extra needs. So we have got the extra equipment, we have got mobile facilities that we can put on site when needed. So I think we have learned so much from Katrina, all the way through Sandy, and I think we are in pretty good shape when it comes to addressing cats. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Hi, good morning. This is Daniel Imbro on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start with operating margins; we saw pretty nice expansion in the quarter. What were the puts and takes to that line item? And then, maybe following on that, what do you think is proper operating leverage in the business, in a normal acc and cat environment? Will Franklin : So I am having a hard time understanding the question. The question was, what's the future of our operating margins? Daniel Imbro : Yes -- we saw a good expansion in the quarter, as we didn't have any catastrophic events. I was wondering, what's a good run rate for operating leverage in a normal growth environment? Will Franklin : I am not sure I follow that. It depends on a number of different things. The location, the nature of the cars, the number of purchased cars versus agency cars. What we focus on is -- our primary metric is EBIT per car, and we do that by controlling every aspect of our operating costs. And so every month, we spend an extraordinary amount of time, dissecting all of our costs and identifying areas that we can improve. In terms of where you get your best operating leverage, is when you can pump more cars through existing capacity. And it has been challenging more recently, because, we have had to go out to locate new capacity to address the current volume influx. And as Jeff has already alluded to, we have done a great job in leveraging our G&A to expand our operating margins. Our business is very scalable at the G&A level, and so we expect -- while G&A costs will continue to grow, we think the leverage on the G&A costs will also continue. Jeff Liaw : And Daniel, we don't have the precise number. We have never guided to what our marginal contribution would be. I think what we have said before and can reiterate here is that, on an incremental unit, a substantial portion of our costs are variable and a substantial portion are fixed. The variable portions are the sub-haul expense of course, titling expense, etcetera. Those happen literally on a per car basis, but their aspects of our cost, labor and otherwise, utilities and so forth that are fixed or semi-fixed. As you have heard us described and just heard Will say again, there are constraints to that, and we have experienced that over the past few years, which is why we have invested in additional capacity in new yards. Daniel Imbro : Thanks for that detail. And then maybe, following on that capacity investments. Are these investments still margin neutral with the increased G&A being offset by increased efficiencies in the yard? Are you seeing that right now? Jeff Liaw : So I think -- the best way to think about it -- first of all, it doesn't affect G&A that substantially. Most of the expenses that we incur, in connection with the new yard, would be at the yard level and therefore show up in our yard expenses. I think you are rightly attuned to the point that there are puts and takes. The day one savings for us, are that, we save money on sub-haul; because the new yard, is by definition, closer to some of the accidents and repair shops than your prior network of yards were. Day one savings can also include the relief of some congestion, so as yards become overstocked, it can be expensive to touch a car multiple times or make it more difficult to access the vehicles you want to reach. There are also, of course, offsetting labor considerations the day you open a yard, you'd add a headcount that won't be as fully leveraged as you were prior. So those offsetting considerations will then layer in, as we have added new yards every quarter, there are some yards that are 'maturing' and then also, some yards we are newly adding. So I think the effect in our business, over the long haul won't be pronounced. I think you see it over the past few years, as we have added capacity. Daniel Imbro : Okay, great. Thanks guys, that's all I had. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. The first question we had is, looking at the volume growth this quarter, I think where you mentioned 8.7% in the U.S. and while that's pretty much in line with I think what you guided medium term of 8% to 10%, that's still a restoration [ph] from the 18% you had last quarter. So just wanted to get your thoughts on probably on what drove that restoration [ph], as well as what you are seeing in the early fourth quarter in terms of trends? And if all the congestion that you are seeing in the yards had a role to play in that restoration [ph]? Jeff Liaw : We don't typically provide forward guidance and will continue to adhere to that general policy. But as for the difference in growth rates in any given quarter, there are -- a number of different factors are going to affect it. But most importantly, as you heard us talk about on the last call and on prior ones, there was a major customer win in the second quarter of last year, which we are lapping. The business continues to grow, including with new account wins. But I think tracking any individual quarter and overanalyzing it, I think, will lead you astray, as you compare our inventory growth numbers and our revenue growth numbers, they tend to move in relationship, but not in a perfectly correlated manner. So there is no one sentence explanation for the difference between 8%, 9% versus the mid-teens you saw previously. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, got it. And just last one from us, you ended the quarter here with $200 million of cash. Is there a minimum level of cash that you look to maintain in the business, and as you look at like, capital allocation opportunities that you have between investing in the business and buybacks etcetera, what are the areas that you are looking at, and how are you prioritizing them right now? Jeff Liaw : There is a minimum level of cash needed to run the business day-to-day. That level is meaningfully below what we have on our balance sheet. But the cash on our balance sheet is a function of a number of different things, including our reinvestment expectations overseas, part one. Part two, tax policy considerations as well, and as you know, there may be changes on the horizon or not. And then of course, our own balance sheet optimization in terms of debt levels and so forth. I think the question you are getting to, is stock buybacks and capital deployments. I think our script will remain the same as always. That is how long term we have returned capital to shareholders. That will continue to be our approach for the future. But as for precisely when and how much and where, we don't have specific plans and can't comment on them. Samik Chatterjee : Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey. Good morning everyone. Will Franklin : Good morning Gary. Jeff Liaw : Good afternoon. Gary Prestopino : Most questions have been answered. But in the U.K., can you maybe tell us, you said 18% of your business is non-insurance at this point, which would make 82% insurance. In terms of that insurance business, where do you stand with cars that are purchased versus cars that are auctioned off on a fee basis? Can you give us some percentages there? Jay Adair : It's about 25-75. About 75% of our volume is fee based, about 25% is sold on a principle basis. Gary Prestopino : Purchased. Okay. So that's a significant flip, right? Because when you first got into the U.K., you were purchasing almost everything, right? Jay Adair : That's correct. Yes. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then lastly, and I know I asked this question in the Q2 call, about the tax rate. I think the tax rate was down like 34% in Q2 and I think, going forward, what kind of tax rate should we use? And I think you guys said 36%. Obviously, it was down again in Q3, and if you back in that -- add back that benefit, it looks like it's about a 34% of tax rate overall. Is that like a new lower level tax rate for you guys, somewhere in the 34%, 33% range? Jeff Liaw : No. And I think when you said 36%, I think Will -- I would say it was five or six quarters ago, we said 35% to 36% is the ongoing rate. And barring statutory change, that's still the right starting point. There will be fluctuations up and down, depending on the particular events of the quarter. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So just use a 35%, 36% range on a GAAP basis going forward? Jeff Liaw : Yes. Correct. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Gary. Operator : The next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Suzuki : Hey guys. Can you just talk a little bit about international markets? And then do you think there are international markets outside of the U.K. and Germany that would be good opportunities for future growth, maybe markets that have somewhat similar fleet and insurance dynamics and will be good candidates for market share expansion over time? Will Franklin : We do. In fact, when we talk about Germany, we are really talking about all the EU and depending on how you define the EU, if you include Turkey; you have got a market that's actually larger than the United States. And we think the value that we bring to that market, demonstrate not only in how receptive Germany is to it, but I think we provide a better solution for both the buyer and the sellers and the actual policyholders themselves. So we think that, once we have the infrastructure in place that we have an opportunity to grow throughout all of the EU. In the other parts of the world, we have analyzed, I think the markets -- in terms of attractiveness, and we are pursuing those. We are in Brazil, we are in India, and we have incipient efforts in China. So I think we have opportunity that we will pursue and it will take several years and won't have any short term impact on our -- we don't anticipate short term impact on our financial results. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thanks. And just one more quick one, which is -- there are some of the other auction companies that are working to monetize the data that they collect on a daily basis from their auction transactions. What do you view as the potential opportunity, if any, to use your data, given the sheer number of transactions you are involved with every month? Will Franklin : Well, I think the best opportunity to monetize our data is to provide their service to our sellers and our buyers. And so to the extent we can predict with accuracy, the ultimate auction value of the car, then that helps them in making their salvage decision. That's probably one of the primary focuses. I think the other area is to find out, on the buyer side, which buyers have propensity to buy certain types of cars, how we can best market those types of cars with those specific buyers. So that's the primary focus for developing our business intelligence efforts. I think on the operational side, there is opportunities to become more efficient by utilizing technology to make some of the decisions that now are made manually. For example, the severity of damage decision that we make at the time that we receive a car. So, we are exploring a number of different ways that we can use this data and new technologies to make our operations more efficient and more profitable, and we are attractive to our sellers. Elizabeth Suzuki : Okay. But no immediate plans to like sell that data to outside sources or anything like that? Will Franklin : None. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Will Franklin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Matthew Paige with Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead. Matthew Paige : Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just one final question for me is, could you provide any regional color for the U.S., in terms of volume increases and if there is any outliers there? Will Franklin : Not really. I really can't think of an area which we have outliers, absent the acquisition of new business. In terms of organic growth, I think we haven't seen an area that exceeds others. I can tell you that, in terms of some of the new business we have acquired, that has required us to focus more efforts on capacity expansion than in a very short horizon. Matthew Paige : Got it. And then just to sneak one in, to follow-up on that, I know you have talked about how land is purchased opportunistically; but is there any area that you wish you could buy more land today? Will Franklin : Sure. Yes. There are several. I mean, Southern California, Miami, New England, Minneapolis. Just almost every place. We have absorbed almost all of our excess capacity. And so, we have a lot of ongoing efforts to expand in almost every part of the United States. Matthew Paige : Great. Well good luck and I look forward talking to you in the future. Will Franklin : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Kelley : Good morning guys. It's David Kelley on for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up to the earlier regional performance question; we are hearing from other auto sectors, really in the aftermarket, the mild February weather negatively impacted volumes. Is that something that you observed as well, anything related to the northeast or Midwest markets in particular on your end? Will Franklin : No. We really don't. We are so broadly focused that weather patterns in one particular area, aren\u2019t something that gain our attention, and there is ebbs and flows to that. So we plan our capacity around peak need, and so if we do that, the fluctuations that occur at the spring really don't have that much of an impact on our operations. David Kelley : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And I guess on that note, any change in the usual cadence of RFP activity on the horizon here? Maybe at a higher level, given your recent land investments, how does that ultimately play into kind of the RFP bidding process going forward here? Will Franklin : RFP, that process continues. It's ongoing and we are involved in that process continually. And I really can't say that there has been any spike in recent activity, it's just ongoing and it's normal and we are aggressively pursuing every opportunity. David Kelley : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate the color. Will Franklin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Bill Armstrong, C.L. King and Associates. Bill Armstrong : Good morning everyone. When we look at organic volume growth, we have got some drivers like miles driven, accident frequency, total loss frequency. When you kind of look at those factors, what do you think are the most important ones that are driving in volume? Do you think they are sort of equally weighted across those factors or maybe there is one that's maybe dominating more than the others? Will Franklin : Yeah. By far, it is total loss frequency. Jeff Liaw : And Bill, what period of time do you mean? Bill Armstrong : Oh, over the last year let's say? Or maybe, just year-to-date for this fiscal year? Will Franklin : Yeah. So the total loss frequency is primarily driven by the increase in repair costs. There is a number of factors that influence that growth, and frankly -- and we have talked about all of it. We have talked about the complexity and the content of cars, and the precision of the manufacturing process and the difficulty of achieving that in the collision repair environment without special skills and tools. And we see that accelerating. What some people sometimes ignore the fact that the collision industry itself is changing. There is a tremendous consolidation process that's ongoing, and we see that continuing. We see the repair facility that are successful in this environment, those that have the capital to spend it on the internal skills and the internal training programs, as well as buy the professionalized equipment that are needed. So all those lead us to expect that repair costs will continue to grow, and perhaps even accelerate in their growth. Jeff Liaw : Bill, and I think Will's good color is backed up by the basic math, right. So if you compare the growth in miles driven is in the economy still remains reasonably healthy, it's still in the low single digits. Accident frequency is up, but again, modestly, low single digits. But if you take it as a proxy for industry growth, the unit growth trends for us and our major competitor together, that rate is much higher than the growth you would see in miles driven and in accident frequencies [indiscernible] than the total loss frequency. That is both the near term and the long term driver. That has been the big change over the past 15 or 20 years in our industry. Historically, a function we think of vehicle age, as the fleet has gotten older, the propensity for total losses increased.  Going forward, that likely remains true and also with the added vehicle complexity you just heard Will describe, you will see that as a factor as well. Bill Armstrong : And it doesn't sound like those secular drivers are going away anytime soon either? Will Franklin : Secular drivers being miles driven? Bill Armstrong : No. In terms of vehicle complexity and just a lot of older cars on the road? Will Franklin : Agreed. Bill Armstrong : Okay. Jay Adair : That for sure, Bill, I would add, all the technology that's going on the outside of the car from cameras to lidar radar to -- all that is going to increase cost of repair. So that's a big piece of what we are also looking at. Going forward, we think there is going to be higher total loss frequency associated with technology. Bill Armstrong : Right. I would agree. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your questions. Speakers, there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to you. Jay Adair : All right. Thank you so much again for attending the third quarter conference call and we look forward to reporting on Q4 and the year end on the next call. Thanks so much. Bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. A. Adair: Thank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Copart. We'll also report on the fiscal year 2017. I'm going to pass it over to Jeff Liaw, our Chief Financial Officer. After a financial update, he'll give it to Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President, who will give you an update on operations. And then finally, I'll talk on the superstorm taking place in Houston and the work taking place in Houston and Florida.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff Liaw. Jeffrey Liaw : Terrific. Thanks, Jay. And first, our apologies to folks listening into the call for the technical difficulty that caused us to delay the call until 10 :15 Central or 11 :15 Eastern.  I'll start with the safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency-related gains; impairment of long-lived assets; acquisition-related fees; certain income tax benefits, foreign income tax credit limitations, and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises.  We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our result on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases described above.  In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal security laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments.  For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the Management's Discussion and Analysis portion of our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. Now to the fourth quarter. It was a record fourth quarter for Copart in terms of unit sales, revenue, gross profit and non-GAAP adjusted operating income. We experienced global revenue growth, as you've noted in the press release, of 13.8%. This is despite a detrimental year-over-year currency effect on revenue of $4.1 million from foreign operations, primarily due to weakness in the pound, which experienced a decline of 7.6% or so year-over-year versus the USD. You'll recall that the Brexit event occurred in late June of 2016. We experienced global unit sales growth of 11.2%, with U.S. unit growth of 11.6% and international growth of 8.8%. U.S. unit growth has been driven by market growth within existing customers as well as new wins with existing customers and new customer wins as well. Excluding catastrophic events, unit sales growth would actually have been higher at approximately 13.6%. This is because last year's sales were enhanced by catastrophic events at that time. Approximately 1% of the growth is attributable to acquisitions, which we'll describe in further detail later in the call.  We experienced global inventory growth of 10%. Even ex-catastrophic inventory from both periods, inventory growth would have been 10.3%. Again, approximately 1% of the growth is attributable to acquisitions. Our service revenue grew by $47.3 million or 16.3% as compared to a purchased car revenue decline of $1.4 million, again, a function of our ongoing shift of principal units to agency arrangements whenever we have the ability to do so.  We grew gross profit from 145 -- pardon me, $141.5 million to $167.5 million, with an increase in gross margins from 42.5% to 44.2%, a reflection in part of an improvement in ASP year-over-year of approximately 7% in the U.S.  Year-over-year, scrap was down slightly or near flat. We again cite the American Recycler average of crushed car bodies across the 5 regions in the United States and average them over the 3 months in the quarter. The U.S. dollar was plus or minus flat versus the peso. The peso was actually up slightly year-over-year, approximately 1%. We have also noted relative strength in the used car market. We cite the Manheim index again averaging over the 3-month period, up from 125.9 to 129.2 over that period.  Moving further down the P&L, turning to general and administrative expenditures. On a GAAP basis, we were up from $31 million even to $34.3 million, excluding depreciation and amortization. Over half of the growth, so approximately $1.9 million on a pretax basis, is attributable to transaction expenses for National Powersport Auctions as well as the excavation assets we have described to you previously.  GAAP operating income growth grew from $106.2 million to $110.8 million or 4.3%. But here notably, that includes the pretax impairment charge of $19.4 million, transaction-related expenses of $1.9 million. Excluding those factors, non-GAAP operating income grew from $106.2 million to $132.1 million, growth of 24.4% year-over-year. And this is despite, again, currency-related drag of approximately $1.4 million, again, due to weakness in the pound.  Net interest expense for the quarter was down from $6.3 million a year ago to $5.5 million this year due to a lower funded debt balance.  Our GAAP net income decreased from $84.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year to $70.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. That again is explained in large part by the impairment charges, which were $19.4 million on a pretax basis and $12.3 million on a post-tax basis.  As for additional color on the impairment charges, for those of you who have followed Copart for years, you know that in fiscal 2015, we wrote off approximately $29 million of our investment in an enterprise-wide SAP implementation. This impairment this quarter reflects largely the write-off of technology assets related to that implementation. At the time of that write-off, we reduced the scope of our systems implementation, retaining a more limited set of SAP modules for further investment and deployment. We have recently concluded that further pursuing this more limited SAP implementation is less efficient and cost-effective for us than other alternatives available to us. Our fourth quarter impairment largely reflects the write-off of the remaining SAP-related capitalized assets on our balance sheet.  You'll recall also that in the fourth quarter of last year, we benefited meaningfully from a GAAP tax shield created by stock option exercise -- exercises, which increased the Q4 2016 income by $11.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis then, net income increased from $69 million to $82.9 million, growth of 22 -- pardon me, 20.2%. After adjusting for the stock split, year-over-year non-GAAP share count increased slightly from 232.5 million to 235.9 million. The majority of that increase is attributable simply to the effect of a higher stock price. We, therefore, experienced 16.7% increase in non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share.  Now turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement before I hand it over to Will. A few cash flow highlights. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $144.2 million, higher than the $125 million of a year ago, due in large part to increased cash earnings as well as the use of deferred tax assets due to the realization of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. CapEx was $47.5 million for the quarter, the vast majority again for land and development.  I also wanted to provide some color on recent strategic acquisitions for Copart, including National Powersport Auction, a leading wholesale auction services provider for the powersport segment. Our rationale in making this investment was twofold. The first is, that we believe this could be an attractive acquisition in its own right. It was a negotiated transaction at a fair valuation for a compelling business in the powersport space. Accretive on an operating income basis to Copart right away. We like it as a stand-alone investment because they are the unquestioned market leader in the wholesale auction arena for powersport vehicles with substantial growth potential, both through geographic expansion and market penetration. The management team there is terrific. The founder remains CEO of the business. They have an entrepreneurial mindset and shared values between them and Copart. We also believe this is a compelling enhancement to Copart's core offering in the powersport space. You've heard us talk about our endeavors in the CrashedToys arena. This brings us a team and relationship in the powersports arena. Over to Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. I'll provide a little color on our operational assets, our business last quarter before I then turn it back over to Jay for final comments.  Copart delivered another strong quarter. In our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we grew our worldwide revenue by $45.9 million or 13.8%, yet our gross margin increased by 18.4%. And excluding the impact of the impairment, our EBIT increased by 22.6%, illustrating the operational leverage endemic in our business. Our consolidated growth in revenue was driven primarily by an 11.2% increase in worldwide volume. In North America, unit volume was up 12.5% and was driven by organic growth and market wins in the insurance market, with continued growth in our noninsurance business and our recent NPA acquisition. On a same store sales basis, which excludes the NPA acquisition, North America volume grew by 10.9%.  While we continue to see growth in volume from our insurance suppliers, driven primarily by the elevated level of total loss frequency, we are also seeing significant growth in our noninsurance business. Excluding NPA, which in the current quarter grew by almost 11%, noninsurance suppliers are composed of several sellers from various sectors from the vehicle redistribution ecosystem and includes franchise and independent dealers, finance companies that give us the repossessions and off-lease vehicles, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and brokers. In addition to the increased overall volume from noninsurance suppliers, we are also seeing a beneficial change in the mix as charity cars, which typically have the lowest gross margin per car, declined in both total units and as a percentage of total units. At the same time, volume from franchise and independent dealers, which typically yield one of the highest gross margins per car, grew by almost 20%. In North America, we also saw an increase in revenue per car. Buyer revenue increased due primarily to higher ASP as used car pricing was up almost 3% and a better mix of cars being auctioned, fewer charity cars and more dealer cars. We also saw an increase in revenue from sellers as we adjusted our pricing to certain sellers to more accurately reflect the value of the land utilized in our operations.  In June, we announced the acquisition of National Powersport Auctions or NPA. NPA is the largest auction dedicated solely to the nonsalvage powersport industry. It has a network of 5 facilities through which it auctions or redistributes primarily motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, personal watercraft and boats. We see NPA as a highly synergistic acquisition. Clearly, NPA and its team have developed an industry knowledge that we can tap to help us improve the performance of our CrashedToys brand and increase returns to our insurance customers from the sale of salvaged motorcycles. We will benefit from the cross-pollination of our buyer bases, especially Copart's international motorcycle buyer base. While 22% of our total volume is sold to international buyers, over 30% of our salvaged motorcycles are sold to international -- into the international market, primarily in Mexico, China, Poland and Guatemala. Additionally, we can leverage Copart's network of 169 domestic locations to marshal inventory and reduce NPA's transportation cost.  We continue our efforts to develop our international buyer base. In North America, the value of products sold to international buyers increased to 22.9 -- 22.7% from 20.3% the previous quarter and 21.1% the same quarter last year. In this quarter, we saw buyers join us from Singapore, Morocco and Bosnia, bringing the total number of countries in which we sell cars to 117.  Turning to the U.K., we saw growth in volume of 3%. The marginal growth in units resulted in part from our decision to reduce our focus on the less profitable direct purchase program. Absent the impact of the direct purchase program volume, we would have grown volume by 5.3%. In addition, in the U.K., we continue to increase the volume of the higher margin cars consigned to us by franchise and independent dealers. Volume from this sector grew by almost 30% and represented over 9% of our total U.K. units. These changes resulted in a modest increase in revenue expressed in pound of 1.2%, but an increase in EBIT of 16.2% and an increase in our EBIT margin of over 400 basis points.  We continue to see meaningful progress in Germany. We are now holding biweekly auctions with cars from 3 insurance companies and one major rental car company. Auction activity is exceeding our expectations as the number of auction participants and the number of unique bidders per auction are actually higher than those same metrics for the United States. Returns achieved through our German auctions exceed those achieved for the existing remarketing convention in which vehicles are placed on a listing board for a period of 2 days, and the high bidder is subject to a 21-day contingency period in which the seller may withdraw an offer to sell. We are seeing interest from several additional insurance companies and our efforts to open 6 more yards in Germany continue.  We're also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil where volume and EBIT contribution continue to grow. This year, we opened our first yard outside the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in the state of Minas Gerais, just north of S\u00e3o Paulo. And we are involved in further expansion efforts.  On an overall basis for the quarter, our operations outside North America and U.K. while profitable remain immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. At the end of the quarter, our North American inventory was up 12% and global inventory was up... [Audio Gap] Generally, we have seen the increased volume lead to reduction in the average processing cost due to greater fixed cost absorption. However, in the current environment, new volume is processed through new yards as most idle capacity had been consumed by the continued growth in volume.  We remain focused on controlling G&A expenses, and we are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by limiting its growth. Total G&A expenses for the quarter were $34.3 million. But when adjusted for the cost associated with the NPA acquisition of $1.9 million, they remain very consistent with the prior 2 quarters despite the increase in both volume and number of yards. During the quarter, we continued our facilities expansion activity, announcing the expansion of 6 existing facilities. During fiscal 2017, we opened 11 new yards, 3 of which were outside of the United States. We expanded 15 existing facilities, and we opened 1 CAT yard, which is a nonoperational facility except in CAT event. In total, we added almost 700 acres of capacity. Our expansion activities will continue as we believe industry trends will drive significant future growth in volume. That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call over to Jay Adair. A. Adair: Thank you, Will. Thank you, Jeff. I want to start by talking about Hurricane Harvey. What we're seeing in that market is a superstorm that is up there with the likes of Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. I'm going to start by saying, I can't say enough about our special ops teams and the operations team, in general. I've been referring to them lately as the Army Corps of Engineers for Copart. Just the mobilization, what takes place in a superstorm like this is phenomenal. I'd like to quantify that a little bit for you. We got our first assignments on August 26. The first day, it was less than 20 assignments. Within a matter of a few days, we were receiving over 5,000 assignments a day. So far, we've taken in over 65,000 assignments. We predict in that market that we will end up taking something north of 85,000 assignments. And we are already -- we have already picked up over 40,000 units or over half of what has been assigned so far. So we are seeing an event that has just such huge magnitude, and I want to give you some more examples of that. We're still seeing over 1,000 assignments a day. We flew in and surveyed the area. Literally, one day after the storm took place, we were operating, up and running the day after the storm took place. And our surveillance told us that there was a lot of standing water. And when you got that kind of standing water and you see that the dams are full, the lakes are full and it's going to take a while for the water to recede, you know that the call-in volume is going to take weeks. So here we are today, more than 20 days past the event taking place and still we're seeing over 1,000 assignments a day. And so that's a prime example. I want to go over how we're handling the storm. [Audio Gap] More than 5 sites, but I'm just going to refer to the 5 major sites that had significant volume. We can store in a CAT situation like this, on average, about 100 cars per acre. So if you were to think about -- if you're picking up 1,000 cars, they're coming in 2 cars at a time on a truck. So there'd be 500 trucks that have to be unloaded if that site is taking 1,000 cars a day. And that 1,000 cars is going to eat up 10 acres. When you think about it in that perspective, some of these members, I think, should surprise you. We immediately took down Royal Purple Raceway, which is in Baytown, west of Houston -- I'm sorry, rather, east of Houston. You've probably seen on the news that racetrack a few times. It's a drag strip and currently has well over 15,000 cars in that site.  On the other side of Houston, we have World Raceway (sic) [ World Speedway ]. And World Raceway is just outside of College Station. So it's quite far west of Houston. But again, another site that has well over 15,000 vehicles in that site. So again, doing the math, that would mean over 150 acres at both those sites currently are full of vehicles. We have a site in Channelview, which is on the east side of Houston. And we have another site in Sealy, which is on the west side of Houston. Both those sites will be completely full within the next 2 weeks. And we have a large Copart Houston facility. The Copart Houston facility is well over 100 acres. And it will be completely full within the next 2 weeks. All in all, not counting Copart Houston facility, not counting that facility, we have over 750 acres of storage. We have room for over 100,000 vehicles. And as I said, we've already picked up over 40,000 units. And we anticipate being finished with this storm from a pickup perspective in the next 3 weeks. So we're picking up well over 2,000 cars a day at the current run rate. From a personnel standpoint, we have over 400 people that are assisting in Houston, that will be working in the affected areas. I've been down there twice. Our chief operating officer has been down there for days on end, along with vice president of ops and many other members of the team. Our marketing department, our sales department, all down there assisting in the process. So I'd say, it's an enormous undertaking. We have over 600 tow trucks that are down there assisting on a regular basis. And we are picking up at any given time into 3 separate locations. As we will fill Royal Purple here in the next week, we'll be transferring over to Channelview and Sealy and some of the other sites that we've got and continuing to fill World because World is by far the largest site that we've taken down.  The majority of expense associated with towing, as I said, should be completed in the next 3 weeks. And once we've got 85,000, 90,000, 95,000 vehicles, we'll see exactly what it's going to be. But once we've got all those vehicles on the ground in the next 3 weeks, the process of selling those vehicles will take place. And I estimate or we estimate that we'll be selling very few of those vehicles in Q1. The majority of the vehicles will be sold in Q2 and Q3. And there will be a tail into Q4. I'm sure there'll be additional questions associated with that. I just wanted to give you some color on it, not to get into too much detail and leave room for questions.  With respect to Irma, I think we got really fortunate here and missed potentially what could have been a very, very tragic event. While there is enormous wind damage in the area, both heavy rain that caused flooding and storm surge from coastal waters were both relatively light considering what it could have been. We've taken over 5,000 assignments so far in this market. We estimate this market to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,500 vehicles that will be assigned. And that's including Florida, Georgia and on up to the Carolinas. So relatively small number of units coming into that market. In addition, I'm happy to say we've taken down no sublots in that market like we have in Houston. And the importance of that is just expense-wise. So in Houston, there will be significant cost associated with taking down those sublots. We usually have to pay some fairly heavy rent to take those sites down. In Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, we are using existing capacity. We have a mega-site in Florida with over 150 acres. That is in standby mode. Will referred to it in his opening remarks. And with such small volume coming into Florida, we don't really need to use that facility. We have enough storage at our existing sites. So as I said, not something that is going to make a huge negative financial impact in the company in the Florida area. But as for Houston, there will be some extraordinary costs that are coming out of that, just like we saw in Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina.  Finally, I just want to comment on Maria. It's currently -- and I'm sure everyone's tracking, it's currently a 145-mile an hour storm. It's sitting over the top of Puerto Rico right now and is a Category 4. The current predictions are that it will turn northward and not hit the U.S. However, being in this business as long as we have, we've seen those predictions be accurate and we've seen them be way off. So for now, based on the speed of the storm, we think it's about a week away or less than a week away if it is going to come towards the U.S. And as I said, we've got ample capacity right now in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas and then up the coast if it is to go into Virginia, New Jersey, New York, et cetera. So fingers crossed, hopefully, that turns out to sea as Jose did. And no doubt it's been a very active year so far for superstorms and for CAT activity.  So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Travis, and we will open it up for questions at this time. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Majek : This is actually Robert on for Bob this morning. On the National Powersport Auction acquisition, you had touched on it in your prepared remark. But can you just talk a little bit more about the business model, the growth potential there and the purchase multiple you paid? Jeffrey Liaw : I can address 2 of those. So the business model is that they are a -- they historically have been a wholesale-only auction platform for motorcycles. The business actually was born -- is largely serving first lenders for repossessed bikes. Over the years, they have diversified their source of powersports vehicle and diversified beyond motorcycles as well. But today, they, and now we, source vehicles both from lenders for repossessions as well as from dealers. The buyers are largely dealers themselves who in turn would sell through their own retail channels. That's been the business model. They've got 5 locations today across the country. We believe there is potential for growth, as I noted earlier, both in terms of geographic expansion as well as further market penetration. The powersports arena is less intermediated than, for example, the car or the automotive universe, and so there's potential in both regard. As for the purchase multiple, historically, as you know, from Universal Salvage in '07, QCSA in '13, we tend not to elaborate meaningfully on those front. This is a compelling acquisition to us financially as well as strategically. We believe it's accretive to us on an operating income basis. And I think that should be illustrative. That's how we think about businesses in terms of the actual cash flow and operating income delivered. We believe it makes good sense for Copart in those regard. Robert Majek : And earlier in the year, you had purchased additional land in Florida for use as standby in catastrophic event. If I understood your earlier comments correctly, it was not used for Hurricane Irma? A. Adair: It's not used materially. I think we're storing 400 or 500 cars there that hit the Punta Gorda area because that yard actually did sustain some damage. That facility that we have there did get flooded. So as a way to switch that one out, we moved those vehicles into Okeechobee there. Okeechobee got room for ... William Franklin : Another comment on our capacity in Florida. One of the reasons that we're not in need of additional sublots is because previously we had purchased a 51-acre site in Jacksonville, which we had not announced, but which we are able to utilize in this situation. Robert Majek : And just lastly for me on Germany and Spain. Anything new in the last 3 months since we had last talked that would suggest faster or slower traction than your original time frame expectations there for the greater rollout? William Franklin : No, I think all indications are very positive. I think a [ gating ] issue in further expansion will be our acquisition of real estate. We're very optimistic about the potential of that market. And as we've said before, when we talk about Germany, we're really talking about all of Europe and the EU. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to follow up on the storm question. I don't think you guys directly said, but I believe in Sandy, you guys lost about $10 million or so, maybe even a little bit more than that when all was kind of washed out. Do you expect to lose money on these storms that we saw this storm season? Or do you think it's more of a neutral or maybe even a potentially profitable event given that you guys have been so thoughtful in terms of how you improved your planning for these items? Jeffrey Liaw : So John, I think that's a fair question, and we weren't -- we're not purposefully being evasive. This is something we'll talk about at the end of Q1. As you know, there are offsetting considerations here. On the one hand, we do run additional unit volume through our fixed infrastructure, so in that regard it is helpful. But as you also know, we face elevated cost, both in terms of the towing expenses, personnel expenses as well and of course, through catastrophic leases. So there are -- those are the offsetting considerations. And again, we'll provide the color. I know that what you're looking for, the directional answer, but we'll have to wait for Q1 and we'll elaborate much further then. William Franklin : Well, let me add one more point. The expenses and the revenues in these kind of situations are very choppy. We tend to recognize the expenses upfront. So while we'll have well over $10 million on lease expenses at least in the current commitment, the revenue generated from the car that -- in which those cars are -- reside won't come until they're sold, most likely that will be in Q3 and Q4. So you're going to see the revenues recognized upfront and the revenues recognized in subsequent quarters. John Healy : That makes sense. I wanted to shift gears a little bit. Something I haven't heard you guys bring up yet, but I wanted to ask about the U.K. business. I've seen a number of press reports that at least probably 6 or 7 of the manufacturers have rolled out kind of cash for diesel type incentive programs to get some of the older engines off the road. Is that something that you think you'll be able to talk about at the end of fiscal '18 and say, hey, it was a big deal for us, and it was a boost to the U.K. business. Are you expecting kind of a big lift over the next 3 or 4 months from that kind of program? William Franklin : We're very aware of the program. We're just too early in the process to figure out the impact this ultimately will have on our financial results. John Healy : Okay. And then just one final question for me. Any thoughts as you go into fiscal '18 just in terms of how you're thinking about capital allocation? You guys have kind of grown into the leverage that you've added a couple of years ago and was just kind of curious if you see yourself more weighted toward buybacks this year or continue on maybe with some opportunistic acquisition? Jeffrey Liaw : John, I think that's a decision and a process that we undertake on an ongoing basis sort of with among ourselves as well as with our Board of Directors as to the appropriate places to allocate capital. Over the long haul, you noted exactly how we do deploy capital, both through acquisitions as well as through share buyback to return capital to the shareholder. There are no imminent expectations of us taking potential action on any of those fronts. But certainly, over time, those will be the 2 paths. And we will -- I should -- also organic investments in our own business. As you well know, capital expenditures for the past couple of years have trended meaningfully above our historical rate. So it's really that first, reinvestment in the business, one, strategic tuck-in acquisitions and share buyback. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : One quick storm question just to try to get the scale. You said you expect 85,000 total assignments. How does that compare to what you think might be the total assignments that come out of Harvey? And then as you bring these vehicles in, could you sort of talk about the quality of the vehicle maybe compared to Sandy, and then obviously talk of more truck and SUV mix down there and it's mostly freshwater damage. When you ultimately auction these, how do you think they will stack up from a ASP versus prior catastrophic experience? A. Adair: Sure. So assuming that you try to base it on what you think your competitor process is and then you try to figure out how many vehicles are uninsured, meaning liability-only coverage, no cost, no collision coverage, so we would never see those vehicles. You're probably looking -- I know there was some numbers out there of 1 million units. You're probably looking at about 0.25 million units would be our guess that were damaged in the storm based on what we picked up, what our competitors are going to process and based on what we believe the market to be, the liability-only coverage vehicles. So Bret, I think that was your question, I understand, how big the actual event is, okay.  As far as the types of damage, Sandy was a saltwater damage. This is more fresh water. And Katrina vehicles sat in the water for up to 7 days, 10 days. I mean, it would be -- it took a long time to get the water off during Katrina. And this is much less than that, freshwater damage. And in many cases, a lot of the vehicles I've looked at, clearly, some of the vehicles went completely underwater, but a lot of the vehicles I looked at have only had light damage. So my guess is, that these will fare a little better than the vehicles that we sold in Sandy and significantly better than the vehicles we sold in Katrina. I mean, if you're going to try and grade flood vehicles these would be better flood vehicles than normal. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then follow-up question then, to skip to the international. I think you commented that Germany and Spain is more of an EU concept as opposed to specific countries. And you said your number of bidders, I think, was exceeding the U.S. number maybe per auction. How much of what you're doing in Germany is being sold in Germany versus traffic that you're seeing on those auctions from other markets in the EU? William Franklin : It's about 25% international, about 25% of the product going outside of Germany and about 75% is within Germany. Bret Jordan : Okay. And when it goes outside of Germany, does it go in the EU or are these still sort of further afield buyers, like you're seeing shipments from the U.S. to Asia? William Franklin : Typically, the EU. Typically, Eastern Europe actually, predominantly Eastern Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu, Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : This is Daniel Imbro on for Ben. I want to start on NPA. Sounds like a strategically beneficial relationship. Was this acquisition more one-off or does it signal you guys would be willing to look at more nonsalvage acquisitions in the future? Jeffrey Liaw : I think as you already know, nonsalvage is a meaningful part of Copart's business today. I think we've shared some rough rules of thumb in the past and said that 80-20 would be about the right ratio for insurance and the noninsurance-related. So this doesn't signal anything new. It's a continuation of our strategy in general. And it's also an important enhancement into our powersports capabilities in particular. You've heard us talk about CrashedToys and how important that is for us to differentiate ourselves within this portion of the marketplace. And the reason that it is of strategic value to us is in large part because the National Powersport team brings particular expertise in that regard. Daniel Imbro : And then maybe from a profitability perspective, how does that business compare to your like, say, salvaged business on a gross profit percentage? Jeffrey Liaw : It won't meaningfully change the profile of the company overall, both because of the size as well as the nature of the economics. It's much more similar than it is different. Daniel Imbro : Great.  Great. Great. And then shifting gears a little bit, last one for me. Thanks for the color earlier on the expansion plan. Do you have any sense how far into this investment cycle we are? Or maybe another way, how many more yards do you guys think you would need to deal with the projected industry growth as well as the excess capacity you're building out for CAT event? William Franklin : We think we need significant growth in our capacity. I mean, if you look at our average quarterly growth over the last 12 quarters, it's over 10%. If you look over the last 8 quarters, it's over 13% in a very stable used car pricing environment. So if you look at the future and you see off-lease vehicles that could approach 4.5 million units a year at the same time you're going to see new car SAAR numbers in the 15 million. I've seen projections as low as the 13 million level. There's been a real tight correlation between the percentage of off-lease vehicles to new car sales and the movement of used car pricing. And when that percentage exceeds 20%, we've seen a meaningful decline in used car pricing. So if that's the case, and we do expect used car pricing to decline, then just based on the math, we expect total loss frequency to continue to increase. Jeffrey Liaw : I can provide some broader color on that for you. We, including based on results over the past many years as well as the past few years, view this as a growth business fundamentally. And so the last time, I think, we shared a good concrete number was the fiscal '15 annual report [indiscernible]. We said we had plus or minus 8,000 acres systemwide. So if the business is growing 5% to 10% and you want to maintain capacity utilization at levels where you've been before, which generally speaking you could do, it does require a substantial investment year-to-year. So you shouldn't expect the investments to just fall off a cliff overnight, one day, so long as the underlying trend in our business is driving activity, accident rates, total loss ratios. For that matter, catastrophic event continue to yield favorable or increase the salvage result, you should expect additional land investments. That's been the story for Copart for decades. Certainly, for the past few quarters as well and for the future as well. William Franklin : And that gives rise to a couple other thoughts I'd like to share. One is, we have a fundamental change in our approach to our business. So in the past, there was far less volatility in the number of units that we process at a car -- at a yard. And now we're seeing wild swings, not only due to CAT event, but for other reasons. And so it was easier to operate closer to the edge, closer to 100%, 105% capacity when we knew that our yard capacity would peak the last week in January, the first week in February and then stay there for 6 weeks. Now we can't service our insurance customers with that model. So in non-CAT areas, we look at an 85% capacity threshold. In CAT areas, we're going to go 70% capacity threshold. So that requires us to expand even further than the growth in the market would indicate. And finally, as we've talked about, we are building our business more and more around our ability to address CAT situation. That's evidenced by our yard that we opened in Okeechobee. We actually purchased a site in Houston that's about 240 acres. We just purchased it so recently we're not able to use it in this storm, but would be available to us next year. So along with the growth in the market, along with our change in our business model, along with our focus on being able to service our customers in a CAT situation, our need for land will continue to grow for the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison, Baird. Craig Kennison : Jeff, I had a question in terms of the cost of the Harvey event, any guidance as to what kind of costs you're incurring in the current quarter? Jeffrey Liaw : Pardon me, in our first quarter or in our fourth quarter? Craig Kennison : The costs you're absorbing related to Harvey that is in the current quarter that we're in today. A. Adair: In Q1? Jeffrey Liaw : Q1? Substantial. Well, we can't really provide much more color than that. We are incurring a meaningful proportion of the costs. You've now heard Jay and Will kind of separately describe the mismatch in timing in that you'll see meaningful costs in Q1 and Q2. You will really start to see meaningful sales in Q2 and Q3. And as Jay noted, tripling [ in Q4 ] as well. So it will be a meaningful part of the conversation end of Q1. Craig Kennison : Okay. And then as it relates to NPA, can you talk about the international opportunity you have there? And then secondly, to what extent can you use VB2 and some of the technology that Copart brings to bear? Jeffrey Liaw : The international opportunity is real. I would say the domestic opportunity is probably still a higher priority given there are only -- they only have 5 locations today. We only have 5 locations in NPA : in San Diego, in Texas, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Atlanta. So we believe that geographic penetration is very relevant. We've done analysis to figure out for their consignment volume how much comes within sort of X miles of a geographic radius. And we think that having a broader footprint in the United States is of a real value to us first. Internationally, I think that's down the road and a real possibility as well. As for the technology question, they have run stand-alone company very capably and thoughtfully for many years. They've got a stable auction platform as well. As for future integration, I think that remains a discussion for future periods. Craig Kennison : And lastly, any update on total loss trends in the salvage market? William Franklin : As [ the fleet ] continue to grow, the most recent report was the first quarter of this calendar year by ISS and I think it was up 2%. Carpark is growing at less than 1% and -- but total loss frequency, which is more difficult to get industry information on, appears to be at -- remaining at an elevated level. So we don't see anything that in the near horizon that's going to change the dynamics that are driving the growth. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : This is Samik on behalf of Ryan. I wanted to start with a storm-related question. So the 85,000 assignments that you're sort of predicting related to Harvey, I just want to see -- and maybe you mentioned this already and I missed it, what were the total assignments during Hurricane Sandy that you received? Because I thought I went back and look and I believe you had called out $20 million of abnormal costs or extraordinary costs during the time of Hurricane Sandy. So just trying to ballpark what the current numbers would look like for this coming -- for this current quarter. Jeffrey Liaw : That's a fair question, Samik, and we appreciate it. The reason I even paused for a second is, there's always math to be done in terms of \"incremental units,\" right? You would have picked up steady-state units in a given market and how many do you actually pick up over that time. In a time period, how much is attributable to the natural disaster itself and how much would you have gotten otherwise? Directionally speaking, I think in our annual report, at the time, we had indicated that we picked up, plus or minus, 85,000 vehicles. So I think what you've heard from Jay is directionally this is just similar. The dust will settle and we'll be more precise about it. But in terms of the rough scale of the unit volume, I think it's -- probably think of it as directionally similar to Sandy. A. Adair: And I -- just a little bit to add. And that is, that the cost on this will be higher. The cost associated with Sandy, while high, will not -- I would argue not as high as what we're seeing in the Houston market. So we'll have more -- as Jeff said, we'll have more color on it when we disclose Q1. But just so you're aware, the actual rent per car is, is turning out to be higher than we paid in the past. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Okay. Got it. All right. And just a quick follow-up, can you sort of give us some color in terms of what your market share is in like Texas and Florida versus the national average because you just mentioned 85,000 assignments out of sort of 0.25 million vehicles being impacted, which is sort of north of [ 33 ]. So I'm just wondering if you have any difference versus the national average in terms of market share in those impacted regions? Jeffrey Liaw : We don't comment about market share globally, nationally or regionally. I'd look to the analysts for assistance on that. I think they broadly have a reasonable picture of the marketplace. A. Adair: I think our competitor may have actually disclosed the amount of units that they thought they were going to handle in their call. And you might be able to look at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Paige, Gabelli & Company. Matthew Paige : Talking about the storms again, while it doesn't sound like it's the case now, but is it possible for the market to become oversaturated with scrap cars if too many CAT events occur closely together? A. Adair: I mean, that's an easy answer, [ no ]. I mean, these fleet vehicles are not like typical salvage because they're not damaged, and they represent a small number. We're selling over 2 million cars a year, [ 1,000 additional in a ] well over a 4 million car market, it's a small number overall. Matthew Paige : Got it. Understood. And then lastly for me, historically speaking, you've been at the forefront of technological advances in this industry. I guess, is there any particular function that you're interested in either expanding or adding to your portfolio moving forward? William Franklin : Yes, we're always looking at technology to make us operationally more efficient. And I think that's a -- I think that's been our focus in the near term. And we're rolling out a number of different features that make our yard operations operate paperless and transfer them to a more seamlessly way that allows us to serve both our buyers and our sellers better. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino, Barrington. Gary Prestopino : Jay, you mentioned that the cost of -- relative to what you're doing in Houston are going to be more than they were for Superstorm Sandy. And I just wanted to get back to that. I mean, in Superstorm Sandy, you were dealing in a highly congested area where land was expensive. So what actually is driving the cost up in Houston beyond what you experienced in Sandy? A. Adair: Sure. It's primarily real estate. I mean, the personnel and selling costs are relatively the same. Relatively the same, meaning adjusting for inflation since the storm. Katrina was 12 years ago and Sandy was 5 years ago. But it's mainly leasing cost. We had property lined up and long story short, we were put in a position, had to pay a little more for the property than we had originally thought we were going to pay for it. So that caused us to -- it's going to cause us to have a higher lease or rent per car expense than we expected, and that we've had in prior storms. Gary Prestopino : Would your towing cost in Houston be more than they were in with Sandy? A. Adair: Not materially, no. I mean, again, adjusted for inflation, they may be a little higher, but other than that, towing, personnel cost and all other associated costs are roughly the same with prior storms, but costs will be higher in this event due to lease expense. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And refresh my memory, you guys expense the towing initially on these cars, right? You don't book it and then release it when you sell the cars, all expense upfront? Jeffrey Liaw : No, the towing, in particular, is the portion of the expense for ordinary course cars, Gary. And this catastrophic event leads to additional accounting questions on precisely how much to capitalize and how much not to. But for the typical car with Copart, that is the one portion of the cost that is notably capitalized and deferred into the period in which it's sold. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So you capitalize the costs is what you're saying? Jeffrey Liaw : Hang on one second there, Gary. Great, Gary, clarifying question. A clarifying point here as the guys were reminding me. Revenue recognition, by the way, is a topic that you've heard a lot of companies talk about. It continues to evolve. But today at Copart, the way we account for the tow cost and the associated revenue is to book those things when they occur. So we book the revenue and we book the tow cost in the period in which we pick up the car. And so it is a catastrophic event, historically, the way we have accounted for it is to book the extraordinary expenses in the period immediately. We do not [indiscernible]. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That's what I was trying to get at. Okay. Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. And we provide that color on the next call. Operator : We have no further questions in the queue, sir. A. Adair: All right. Thank you, Travis. Thank you, everyone, for attending our fourth quarter call. And we look forward to reporting on Q1 on the next call. Thanks so much. Bye.",

Baird John Healy - Northcoast Research Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens Matthew Paige - Gabelli & Company Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Chantel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter earnings release conference call for 2018. With me in the room today is Jeff Liaw, CFO; and Will Franklin, Executive Vice President for Copart. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff Liaw, who will give you some color commentary and then over to Will Franklin, and then we'll open it up for questions. So it's my pleasure to introduce Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Jay. I'll start with the Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses, impairment of long-lived assets, certain income tax benefits, foreign income tax credit limitations and payroll factors related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases described above. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. Now turning to the first quarter; we -- Copart enjoyed another record first quarter in unit sales, revenue, gross profit and operating income. As you can see in the press release, we grew global revenue by 21% year-over-year for the first quarter. The underlying factors here are slightly beneficial year-over-year currency effect of $1.7 million on foreign operations, primarily due to relative strength in the British pound after lapping the Brexit event in June of last year, 2016. Excluding the effect of Hurricane Harvey, revenue grew by 15.8%. A little color on this front; under current revenue recognition guidelines, we do recognize revenue for certain pre-auction services we provide, including, for example, towing and flood cleanup services. As a result, we booked revenue for some cars not yet sold through our auctions. We enjoyed global unit sales growth of 10%, with U.S. growth of 11% and international growth of 5%. U.S. unit growth was driven primarily by market growth, territory wins, new customer wins, as well as the effects of catastrophic events and acquisitions. If we exclude catastrophic events from both periods, last year and this year, for the first quarter, U.S. unit sales grew by 10.6% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, U.S. unit sales grew at 8.3%. Turning to inventory; this is again the non-GAAP inventory measure, these are literally the cars in Copart facilities. Global inventory grew by 17.5%. Excluding CAT inventory for both periods, inventory growth would have been approximately 7% for the period, with less than 1% of the inventory growth attributable to acquisitions. Our service revenue grew $67 million year-over-year or 21.8%. Our purchased car revenue growth of $6 million -- $6.1 million or 15.8%, continuing the trend you've seen in recent quarters as we've migrated business from principal to agency arrangements. Our gross profit grew from $145.3 million to $163.3 million with a decrease in gross margins from 42.0% to 38.9%, which is a mix of offsetting factors. I'll start first with the favorable gross margin and gross profit driver of an increase in average selling prices for our cars. In the U.S., we experienced an increased year-over-year of almost 14% in average selling prices, largely due to increased selling prices for our insurance carrier-sourced cars due to a combination of factors, which Will will expound upon further along in this call. But a few things of note; the first is that we are observing newer cars being totaled, we're also seeing less severely damaged cars being totaled. For our auctions, despite seeing substantial unit growth year-over-year, we're seeing heightened bidding activity in excess of unit growth, meaning we have more bidders and more bids per car that we are listing. We are also benefiting from what appears to be a strong used car price environment, the Manheim index is up almost 6% year-over-year with six consecutive record months. And lastly, we are experiencing a reasonably sound scrap environment, up 11% year-over-year. The unfavorable driver of gross margin rate and gross profit for the period, of course, is the catastrophic expenses we incurred in the period of approximately $36 million. In the catastrophic events, we incurred two types of costs, including first, unit-related expenses such as sub-haul expenses and flood cleanup services, as well as period expenses such as rents for temporary facilities, personnel and travel related expenses. In this period, we incurred substantial expenses on both fronts. Per our prior discussion of our revenue, because we incurred majority of our sub-haul and flood cleanup excesses in this period, our future mix of catastrophic costs will shift more towards ongoing period expenses, including rent, people and travel. The net effect for us in this quarter of Hurricane Harvey was an approximately $17 million pretax loss. Over the full lifetime of Hurricane Harvey, we expect to incur a net loss to serve our customers. Turning to general and administrative expenses; we were down from $35.2 million last year to $34 million this year, ex-D&A. This is largely the result of lapping $5.2 million in payroll taxes from a year ago in connection with certain executive stock options exercises. Excluding this change, G&A increased by $4 million, approximately half of which is attributable to acquisitions and the balanced organic. Our GAAP operating income grew from $104.8 million to $123.9 million or 18%. If we normalize simply for the payroll expenses incurred last year, operating income was up 13%. As noted previously, our net catastrophic losses this quarter of $17 million; so excluding this event and also normalized for payroll expenses, operating income grew by some 28% year-over-year. Our net interest expense for the quarter was down from $5.6 million to $5.4 million due largely to a lower funded debt balance. Last note on the P&L on GAAP net income, we -- non-GAAP net income, we grew from $66.3 million to $77.1 million, growth of 16%. This excludes the booked tax benefit of our early adoption of ASU 2016-09 regarding tax treatment of certain stock option exercises. This also excludes $3 million as a loss on the disposal of certain non-operating assets, a tidbit here worth noting; when we acquire real estate, we allocate purchased price based on market values to land, buildings and improvements. In this case, we demolished certain buildings acquired almost 10 years ago because we had a higher and better use of that capacity which is for storage capacity for our vehicles. After adjusting for the stock split, year-over-year non-GAAP share count is up slightly from $234.7 million to $236.8 million, with a majority of this increase attributable to the effect of a higher stock price. The bottom line is a 15% increase in non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share. One last note on cash flow, and I'll turn it over to Will. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $93.3 million compared to $74.3 million a year ago due to a combination of factors, including increased cash earnings. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $41.5 million of which approximately 70% is for land and development, continuing the theme you've heard us talk about in prior calls, our 2020 program to grow capacity to serve our customers. With that, I'll turn it to our EVP, Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. Let me add a few comments, provide some color on our performance for the quarter as well as some color on what's going on with the industry. Copart delivered another strong quarter. This quarter, we grew our worldwide revenue and EBIT by $73.2 million and $19.1 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Harvey, our revenue and EBIT growth would have been $54.7 million and $36.5 million, respectively. And the growth rate in revenue and EBIT would have been 15.8% and 34.8%, respectively. In North America, our revenue growth, excluding the impact of Harvey was $49.9 million or 17.3%. In North America, non-Harvey unit volume was up 9.6% and was driven by organic growth and market wins in the insurance car market, the continued growth in our non-insurance business and our recent NPA acquisition. We continue to experience growth in the overall salvage car market despite the introduction of accident avoidance technology and its propagation throughout the car park, accident frequency continues to grow. According to independent fiscal [ph] services, the average quarterly growth in the number of paid solution claims for the last 18 quarters has been 4.7%. And in the last quarter reported, the growth was 0.3%. However, even more impactful than the increase in claims frequency is the increase in the total loss frequency which over the last seven quarters has grown at an average rate of 6.7%. Total loss frequency is the percentage of time that a car involved in a plane is totaled rather than repaired or restored. It is important to note that the growth in total loss frequency has incurred in an environment of increasing used car values. We see nothing in the near future to suggest an abatement in the growth in either claim frequency or total loss frequency. In North America, our quarterly insurance volume has grown in absolute unit terms at an average rate of 12% since the beginning of our fiscal 2015. We also continue to see growth in volume from our non-insurance suppliers. These suppliers include franchise and independent dealers, finance companies who give us the repossession in off-lease vehicles, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and brokers. On a quarter-over basis, volume from franchise and independent dealers grew by 23%. These cars are typically rental drive cars yielding higher ASPs with higher profitability and bearing a shorter cycle time. Overall growth excluding NPA in our non-insurance volume was 13%. In North America and excluding the impact of Harvey, our revenue per car on a quarter-over basis was up approximately 7%. Revenue increased due primarily to higher ASPs, used car pricing was up almost 5.9% and we saw beneficial change in the mix of vehicles sold at auction as we saw meaningful decrease in the number of charity cars and a significant increase in dealer cars. And we added to our mix the motorcycles from NPA which carry a higher ASP and a higher revenue per transaction. We are also seeing what we believe to be a less severely damaged car being totaled by the insurance companies. Finally, we saw an increase in revenue from sellers as we adjusted our pricing to certain sellers to more accurately reflect the value of the land utilized in our operations. We're also seeing the benefit of our marketing efforts to our international buyers and the impact it's having on our ASPs. Total bids from international buyers were over 35% higher than the same quarter last year and included, for the first time bids from Albania, Turkmenistan and Gibraltar. In North America, the value of products sold to international buyers increased to 21.9% from 19.8% for the same quarter last year. Turning to the U.K.; we saw marginal decline in units sold, resulting in part from our decision to eliminate less profitable programs. Nevertheless, expressed in GVP [ph], revenue grew by 1.1% and gross margin grew by 6.8%, as we continue to focus on the more profitable markets. We continue to see meaningful progress in Germany; we hold biweekly auctions for three insurance suppliers and two major rental car companies. Auction buyer participation is exceeding our expectation as the number of participants and the number of unique bidders per auction are higher than those same metrics for the U.S. Returns achieved through our Copart auctions in Germany significantly exceed those achieved through the existing re-marketing convention in which vehicles are placed on listing board for a period of two days, and the high bidder is subject to a 21-day contingency period in which the seller may withdraw the offer. Key to our growth in Germany is expansion of our network facilities. In addition to the sole operational facility which is located near Hanover, we have purchased or in the process of developing two new facilities in Northern Germany, one near Berlin [ph] and the other near Leipzig. We expect to begin the phasing-in operations at these locations within six months. We continue our efforts to open at least three other facilities in Germany, one in the western and two in the southern areas of the country. We're also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil, where volume was up 21% and EBIT contribution was up 140%. Nevertheless, on an overall basis, for the quarter, our operations outside of North America and U.K. while profitable remained immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. At the end of the quarter, our North American revenue was up approximately 20%. Excluding CATs, North America inventory was up more than 8%. Inventory outside of North America remained relatively flat. On a consolidated basis and excluding the abnormal operating costs associated with Hurricane Harvey, our average cost to process each car remained relatively consistent with the same quarter last year. We remain focused on controlling our G&A expense, and we are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by limiting its growth. Total G&A expense for the quarter was $34 million and included $1.8 million of additional G&A expense associated with the NPA operations. Excluding the additional NPA cost, G&A remained very consistent with the prior three quarters despite increases in both unit volume and the number of yards. It should be noted that extreme weather events, as cited by CCC, are occurring more frequently and are impactful to our volumes and operations. In 2016, the insurance industry experienced 750 extreme weather events. In 2015, that number was 730. During the 10-year period ending in 2015, the average number of events per year was 590. CATs and our ability to address them on behalf of our insurance customers are becoming an increasingly important part of our service offering. Our goal to providing immediate landing capacity to our insurance customers during a CAT, along with the continuing organic growth in the insurance market and our growth in the non-insurance business is driving our need for more land. During the last fiscal year, we opened 12 new yards and we expanded 15 existing locations. In total, we added almost 700 acres of capacity. Our expansion activities continued into this quarter and will continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we opened two new yards, one in Exeter, Rhode Island and one in Andrews, Texas. In addition, we expanded seven existing locations and opened one subplot [ph]. In total, we added approximately 226 acres of new capacity. With the new yards and the new expansions already in the construction phase, including mega CAT yards in Houston, North Carolina, New Jersey and Alabama, we could add another 1,000 acres during the remainder of this fiscal year. That concludes my comments on the quarter. Chantel, will turn the call back over to you for the Q&A session. Jay Adair : Chantel? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities. Robert Labick : Wanted to start with NPA, the National Powersports. What did you learn since you've had it in the fold? How is it going versus your expectations? And are you looking at additional adjacent growth opportunities? Are there any on the radar now or how should we think about that part of the business? Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. So the National Powersport acquisition I think you know we completed in June this year, and it has performed according to our expectations. We acquired the business believing, as you may recall from our prior discussion, that it was both an excellent stand-alone investment as a company well positioned in attractive marketplace with room to grow ahead of it and that it was also very strategically relevant to us given our recent focus on the powersports arena with CrashedToys and otherwise that it would ultimately help us serve our existing customers as well. That thesis remains very much intact; the Company is performing well, the team is excited to be part of the Copart family as well, so no surprises there. And then as to your question about other, not particularly -- I think you know we wouldn't speculate on any forward-looking M&A activity. But no, it's not per se a part of the systemic program. Robert Labick : Got it. Okay, great. And then congratulations on the progress in Germany. You answered many of my questions there, so I'll just shift to, I think the other news on the call, which is really interesting was the positive pricing on U.S. insurance cars. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about how much business, perhaps temporary as a result of used car prices being up because of the hurricane? How much is the structural shift? And what other drivers behind that shift of newer cars being totaled? Jay Adair : I think that's what we're seeing is not a onetime event. I think we're seeing a trend, and I think what's happening is we're seeing the increase in repair costs driven by a number of different factors. And we talked about this very extensively. The complexities of the cars, the exotic metals. We're also seeing consolidation in the repair industry, where it's predicted by the year 2020, 45% of all repairs be handled by MSOs. All of these are leading to an increase in repair costs, which internally are leading to a higher salvage frequency in the newer and more complex cars. Operator : Our next question will come from Craig Kennison, Baird. Craig Kennison : Wanted to ask about Harvey, first of all. I think in the last call, you said you were assigned 85,000 vehicles. I'm wondering, how many of those have you actually sold? And how many remain to be sold? Jeff Liaw : So the sales of the units from this quarter of approximately 12,000 or thereabouts. And the pickup activity still some stragglers, by and large, completed the pickups in this quarter. And just to point out again what Jeff said previously. The majority of expenses associated with processing these cars, the recovery and the storage, the place in the event, it occurs at the very beginning of the process right up to the assignment. And that's why you see the loss generated in this quarter. So you see some choppiness in the impact of the storm on our financial results for the next couple of quarters. But on an overall basis, we expect to have a loss. Craig Kennison : Yes, that's very helpful as you frame it. And maybe following up on that, Will, of the $36 million of cost reported associated with Harvey, does that include all the cost to process the cars or just the abnormal cost above and beyond what it would normally take to process a vehicle? William Franklin : That's just -- that's in the abnormal costs and primarily is due to the extra storage, extra labor costs and primarily the extra towing costs. Craig Kennison : And then shifting gears, the incremental margin in the quarter looked to be fantastic. I mean, your EBIT margin on a core basis appear to be up almost 500 basis points based on our math. I mean, how sustainable is that trend? What do you -- what is really driving that incremental profitability? And again, how sustainable is it? Jeff Liaw : We're not providing forward-looking guidance, as you know, Craig. There's nothing particularly distorting the quarter, I'd say, meaning the size of the CAT, obviously, which we help normalize for you. So you're seeing the benefit, in some cases, of some operating leverage. Strong unit growth leveraging our existing facilities and infrastructure. You're seeing, of course, G&A that's not growing anywhere near the rate that our revenue and gross profit is. So I think it's largely operating leverage on the G&A level. And then, of course, the selling price phenomenon you heard Will and me both talk about. Operator : Our next question will come from John Healy, Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to follow-up on the comment you guys made about the cars that you're seeing come through the yards being a little bit younger. Is there any way to think about that by kind of bucketing the age of vehicles? I know a lot of industry data sometimes looks at cars less than 3 years old or 3 to 8 years old and maybe older than 8 years old. Is there a way to think about kind of what you're seeing today in terms of your mix and maybe that 0 to 3 or 3 to 8-year old car population? Jeff Liaw : John, I think we don't intend to provide any further data publicly, but the logic is what you just described. So we look at it on a histogram basis, how many cars are 0 to 1, 0 to 5, 6 to 10, etcetera, and that's what yielded the commentary you heard today, which is that we are seeing a newer mix of cars in the first quarter this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. William Franklin : I might add another comment that there's another metric that we look at, and that's the estimated repair value to the ACV of the car. And we're seeing what you hope -- we think is a trend of cars being towed at a lower repair-to-ACV ratio. John Healy : Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the costs associated with Harvey event. On the kind of processing side, how much of the processing costs do you think would stay in until those vehicles are absolutely sold? How much of that kind of what I would say variable expense line item should we see in 2Q and 3Q do you think? Jeff Liaw : John, I think not prepared to be more specific on that front, except to say that, as you heard from Will, a good chunk of the costs for us are the towing expense and then also the flood cleanup. Those expenses largely incurred in the first quarter. That said, there are ongoing period costs, processing costs, as you might call them, including the rent for temporary facilities, including personnel. So we still have a lot of extra folks who are on the ground there in person managing the volume we've got as well as the travel and corresponding expenses that comes from having extra personnel deployed there. So those expenses will continue in subsequent quarters. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : What are you seeing on the title transfer time [indiscernible] Harvey? Is that -- is the product moving pretty quickly? And it seems like you've got is it 70-odd thousand cars left to clear? Jay Adair : No, we don't have 70,000 left to clear. But yes, we have seen a slowdown. And it's just the capacity of the state to process these titles. We're doing everything that we can on our end. And initially, we saw times that were consistent with what we would expect to normal operations. But more recently, we've seen the slowdown. Bret Jordan : Okay, okay. I thought you said you had 85,000 assignments on the last quarter conference call, and you said you've done 12,000 on the first quarter. So are there fewer than 70,000 remaining? Jay Adair : No, we've got more. But what we're dealing with right now, Brett, is we've already sold more cars in November than we sold in the last quarter. So trying to do the math when we're selling at such a fast rate. The majority I say two things from listening to the questions. The majority of the vehicles will be sold in this Q. So in Q2, the quarter we're in now, we're going to unload a majority of those vehicles. We'll be selling the remainder in Q3 and Q4, but the majority of Q2. The second thing I would say is because we've incurred what was it, Jeff, $17 million of expense? Jeff Liaw : $36 million of expense in revenues to $17 million net loss. Jay Adair : $17 million net in the last quarter, it will be profitable going forward, meaning they're going to benefit Q2. They're going to benefit Q3 and benefit Q4. But overall, we will lose, as Will explained earlier. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And I think a couple times in your prepared remarks, you mentioned account wins. Is there anything meaningful shifting and on the insurance side? Jeff Liaw : Nothing that we would identify specifically. We're always competing for business in such a competitive market. But we're also always trying to prove our service offerings and our products, and I think we're doing a good job in doing that. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then you said 1,000 acres possible in the balance of fiscal '18. Is that -- would that get us to sort of where you need to from a real estate standpoint or is this -- are we looking to get '19 growing real estate beyond that level? Jeff Liaw : No. If the trends continue -- we're seeing 10% growth in the just the insurance salvage market, that means we'd have to have 700 or 800 acres a year to keep pace. And in addition to that, we've employed a new approach to CATs to where we want to be able to land bank large-CAT capacity in high-risk areas. And that also is adding to our need for land. So I don't see the need for land abating for the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu, Stephens Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu : Wanted to start on G&A. So G&A was actually down year-over-year. And Jeff, I think you called out that we were a big driver was lapping over a step-up in payroll taxes from auctions. Going forward, you guys still expect it to grow on a dollar basis but leverage as a percentage of sales? And is there a certain revenue growth that you need to get that leverage? Jeff Liaw : To answer your question, yes, we expect it to grow. And I don't think there's any way to avoid that with the increase of products and technology and volume and land capacity. But we also don't expect it to grow as fast as our revenue. So we think that's [ph] still leverageable. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Can you maybe talk about what's driving the improvement in that margin? Are there any big call-outs you guys are doing? Or is it a lot of smaller things that are driving these efficiencies? Jeff Liaw : For an earlier question, I think our margins are driven by unit volume leverage. So the benefits of selling additional units through fixed facility, so to speak. that will obviously grows over time as well. The selling prices of our vehicles have been strong. You heard commentary on that today as well. And then lastly, I think the point you raised at the outset of your question here, which is G&A, which grows but typically not at rates anywhere close to the kind of revenue growth rates we're experiencing today. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. And then moving over to Europe; I know you guys have commented that the German market is really representative of the EU. You guys talked about the progress in Germany, but are there any specific European countries you guys are looking to expand into in the near or intermediate term? Jay Adair : Well, we're currently in Spain, and we think we have the same opportunity in Spain. We have one existing facility in Madrid, and we're currently looking at expanding into the areas of Barcelona and Magala. So I think that would be the next area that we probably be focusing our efforts. Operator : Our next question will come from Matthew Paige, Gabelli. Matthew Paige : Just one question for me today. I know they make of a very small portion of the car park, but do you have any color as to how claim or totaling frequency on electric vehicles compares to their traditional counterparts? Jeff Liaw : I think your question -- your premise is the right one, which is that the sample size remains so small, but it's -- in most respects, it's too early to tell. The combination of factors here these electric cables are often made out of more complex substrates, so the panels are more difficult to repair. They also often come with additional safety technologies or cameras on the perimeter, which again, also further escalate repair costs and could or should lead to total loss rates being higher. But those are -- it's too early to render a definitive conclusion on that front. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Couple of questions here. Can you maybe just because a lot of these cars that you're getting in Hurricane Harvey are freshwater cars versus saltwater, I know you said you've only auctioned off a couple -- about 12,000 small amount relative to what you've been assigned. But can you give me -- give us some idea relative to other hurricanes where there been saltwater damage? Are you seeing a lift in price of the cars because they're freshwater damaged? Or that doesn't really matter at all? Jay Adair : We are, Gary. And I think it goes beyond the nature of the damage. I think that the interest companies and the repair shops are completely overwhelmed by the monstrous volume in those areas and I think we're getting better cars than you might in a different environment. So the ASPs on the Harvey cars are higher than in other CATs and in overall company averages. Gary Prestopino : Okay, that's helpful. And then did you guys call out what cycle express added in revenues this quarter or can you do that for us? Jeff Liaw : We didn't. We just provided the color that the U.S. unit sales would have been 8.3%, excluding NPA. Gary Prestopino : Okay, all right. So you're not calling that out, that's fine. And then lastly, you mentioned that you're seeing strong growth on the non-insurance vehicles, particularly on the franchise and independent dealer side. Couple of questions here. What is -- has there been any shift in the amount of cars that are non-insurance? I believe it's kind of hovered around 20%. Are you seeing a shift higher now as a percentage of total of... Jay Adair : Yes. Non-insurance cars is growing as a percentage, excluding Harvey, of course. And that's been driven primarily by cars from franchise and independent dealerships but there's other segments that have been growing as well. Gary Prestopino : I mean, has the shift been -- I mean, if it was 20%, has the shift been now to 22%, 23% or is that something you just don't call out? Jay Adair : Something we haven't called out. We've talked about the growth in that market itself, which was 13% last quarter. Gary Prestopino : Right, okay. And then in terms of these non-insurance vehicles, do they, on an overall basis, especially the ones that are trade-ins, are they lifting your average -- your cumulative average selling price? Or are you still looking at maybe the 10 to 12-year-old car that's going to get $2,000 at an auction? Getting younger vehicle... Jay Adair : Six quarters ago, where much of our lift in non-insurance cars came from charity. It was actually detrimental to our average ASPs. But that's no longer the case. So we've made some adjustment to our approach to charities, and we've reduced the number of cars coming from that market. At the same time, we've expanded significantly our efforts in the areas the franchise and dealerships. We have new programs in place. We have new resources focused on it. But probably more importantly, we're getting higher returns than we have been in the past on these types of cars. And that's all leading to more volume. Those cars have a higher ASP and create an uplift to our overall ASPs. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman, JP Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : This is Samik on for Brian Brinkman. I just want to get your outlook first on pricing. You had strong momentum when it comes to ASPs this quarter. But I just have go through the processing of the vehicles -- hurricanes in the coming quarters. Do you see it having sort of a more depressing or a bit of pressure on pricing going forward just given the volumes you'll be processing? Or do you think the mix is strong enough here to offset that? Jeff Liaw : The mix effect of the hurricane would more than offset the supply factors you just described. So the typical hurricane car sales for more than our standard insurance-sourced vehicle. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, got it. Then when I look at the cost headwinds you had of $36 million in the quarter, and when I compare that to the closest competitor, they had roughly $5 million of cost. And I was wondering if you had any cars. I know you've gone sort of -- you don't have visibility the exact nature of their cars, but is there any thoughts you have what's driving that big difference between you and your closest competitor in the abnormal cost rate to the hurricanes? Jeff Liaw : As you noted, we don't have, of course, have any internal visibility as to how they account for the catastrophic events. I look, of course, that our quarter doesn't end at precisely the same time that theirs does, so that may be a driver. We just know that $36 million is what it took for us to provide excellent service to our customers in connection with these catastrophic events. Hard for me to comment on theirs. Let me just one area, which I think we exceeded, I think, the expectations of our insurance. We actually obtained an extra 800 acres of storage capacity at a cost of about $15 million. And I think those types of efforts generate cost in excess of what otherwise would be expensive and situations. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Jay Adair : Thank you, Chantel. Thank you, everyone, for attending the first quarter call for Copart. Happy Thanksgiving, and we look forward to reporting on Q2 next year. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this conference has now concluded. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.",

Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Chantelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter earnings call for Copart. On the call today is Jeff Liaw, our CFO; and Will Franklin, our Executive Vice President. It's now my pleasure to turn it over to our CFO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. I'll start the call as always with a brief Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of income taxes and the deemed repatriation of foreign earning net of deferred tax changes, disposals of non-operating assets, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll factors related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued earlier today. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. Then moving to the second quarter, this was a record second quarter for Copart in unit sales revenue gross profit and operating income. We grew global revenue by 31.3% including a slightly beneficial year-over-year currency effect of $5.5 million primarily due to relative strength in the British pound. Excluding Hurricane Harvey our revenue grew at 18.5%. Copart grew global unit sales at 15.5% with U.S. unit growth of 18 and international unit growth of 1. U.S. unit growth by driven by catastrophic events as well as market growth and Will will provide more color on those fronts. Excluding catastrophic events, U.S. unit sales growth was 9.4% for the quarter year over year. Turning to inventory, our global inventory grew at 8% year over year at the end of the second quarter, excluding catastrophic inventory from both periods inventory growth would have been 8.1%, so virtually no difference. This is because if you exclude Hurricane Matthew and the Baton Rouge events from our inventory last year in turn Hurricane Harvey and Irma from this year we end up with inventory growth of 8.1%. Approximately 1% of this inventory growth is attributable to acquisitions and in terms of the U.S. and international split U.S. inventory grew at 7.8%, international growth is 9.5. For the quarter, Copart grew service revenue of $91.1 million or 29.6% year-over-year and purchase car revenue growth of 17.7 million or 44.7%. Gross profits grew from a 146.8 million to a 191.6 million with a slight decrease in gross margin rates from 42.0% to 41.7%, a mix of offsetting factors, but most significantly Harvey. Excluding merely the effects of the quarter\u2019s catastrophic events, our margins would instead have been 44.3% on a gross margin basis. Continuing these, we talked about last quarter we continue to observe improvements in United States average selling prices, year-over-year in this case for the quarter of 27.5% in the U.S. and 16.1% ex-Harvey. As we discussed on the last call, we are noting that newer cars are being totaled, less severely damaged cars are being rendered total loss as well and that in turn we are observing significantly increased biding activity, both from our registered bidders as well as more bidders per unit. Again, Will will describe more of the underlying drivers and underlying levers that we are pulling to generate that benefit. We also continue to observe a reasonably strong used car price environment. Manheim has finally broken its consecutive month streak of record highs, but used car prices remain substantially higher by their index than last year. And finally, we have noted a reasonable strong scrap environment as well, up 16% year-over-year. All balanced then, we generated a benefit of $8.3 million for the quarter of Hurricane Harvey, which represents a cumulative then $9 million loss through first six months of fiscal '18. We will also note that that $9 million loss from catastrophic events excludes significant capital expenditures made both in, anticipation of catastrophic events as well as in response to them. All told, Hurricane Harvey remains the most substantial resource mobilization for catastrophic event in Copart\u2019s history. Our G&A expenditures for the quarter were up from 32.4 million a year ago to 34.7 million this year excluding D&A. The difference is due almost exclusively to the acquisition of NPA a year ago. Our GAAP operating income growth, we grew operating income from $108.9 million to $150.9 million or 39% year-over-year. Our operating margin last year of 31.2% compares to this quarter of 32.9%. Again, our rates were burdened approximately 150 basis points from Hurricane Harvey. Net interest expense was approximately flat year-over-year with a lower debt balance offset slightly by a higher risk-free rate. I will now pause for a moment on income taxes which are unusually complex of course for the quarter by virtue of passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017. I will categorize the effects in two broad buckets, the first being change in federal income tax bridge. We will benefit from the reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% to an eventual 21%. However, for Copart\u2019s fiscal '18 because we straddle the pre-reform and post-reform periods, our federal tax rate for this fiscal year will be 26.9%. In fiscal '19 and beyond our U.S. federal tax rate instead will be 21%. This quarter of course includes the benefits of that change from 35% to 26.9%. It also includes the benefits of releasing of some of the accrual from Q1 of 2018, which had assumed at the 35% prior federal tax rate. If you wanted to estimate our effective rate for this year, the better math would be to take first six months of this year and to exclude the transition tax change, which I will now describe in greater detail. So companies like ours with foreign un-repatriated earnings, we calculate our transition tax due, which in our case is subject to sit to further refinement as well as additional guidance from IRS. Nevertheless in this quarter, we accrued approximately net $10 million charge for this transition tax, which is net of deferred tax changes as well. Our GAAP net income then increased from $66 million a year ago for the second quarter to $103.3 million this quarter. The results of operating profit growth as well as the various tax changes I just described a moment ago. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income grew from $67.4 million a year ago to $111.4 million this year, growth of 65%. You can see in the detailed reconciliation, the exclusion of the booked tax benefits of our early adoption ASU 2016-09 as well as various other factors described a moment ago. Our effective share count is increased slightly from $234.2 million to $238.7 million largely attributable to an increase in stock as well as stock option exercises. On a non-GAAP basis, our EPS has grown from $0.29 to $0.47. Last couple of comments on the balance sheet and cash flow and I'll turn it over to Will, our operating cash flow for the quarter of $93 million as compared to $81.3 million a year ago, a reflection of increase cash earnings as well as working capital movements. Finally, on capital expenditures, we invested $69.4 million this past quarter. Of which, approximately 80% again was for land in development a continuation of our capacity expansion efforts in general. With that, I'll turn it over to EVP, Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. And let me add few more comments and some more color on the quarter. Copart delivered another strong quarter. This quarter we grew our worldwide revenue and EBIT by $109.6 million and $42.1 million respectively. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Harvey, our revenue and EBIT growth would have be $64.8 million and $33.8 million respectively. The growth rate in revenue and EBIT excluding Harvey would have been 18.5% and 31% respectively. In North America, our revenue grew by $100.5 million or 34.6%. Excluding the impact of Harvey, this growth would have been $55.7 million or 19.2%. In North America, total volume was up year-over-year by 18.6%; excluding Harvey volume, it was up 8.2% and was driven by organic growth and market wins in the insurance market, the continued growth in the non-insurance market and our recent NPA acquisition. Volume from non-insurance sellers, which include franchise and independent dealers, franchise -- excuse me, finance companies, who have assigned us the repossessions in office vehicles, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and brokers grew by over 31%. Excluding volume from NPA which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, our non-insurance volume increased over 18%. Also with the non-insurance market, we are seeing a shift in mix as growth in volume from dealers was up nearly 27% and volume from charities and municipalities were down 4% and 26% respectively. As we strategically dedicate our limited land capacity to more profitable markets, dealer cars were typically run and drive cars that yield an average ASP and average gross margin significantly greater than those for insurance cars, while at the same time have a shorter cycle time. In total non-insurance cars represented 20.5 of all North American cars sold. In North America and excluding Harvey volume which yielded a higher value to salvage car, our service revenue per car on a quarter over quarter basis was up approximately 9.9%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs. The increase in ASPs were driven by a number of factors, the value of used cars as measured by the Mannheim index was up over 6%, the value of crushed car bodies as measured by the index has maintained by American Recycler were up about 16%. The beneficial mix of cars sold has previously discussed and the additional volume from NPA which yields a higher ASP. Finally, we continue to see increases in revenue from sellers as we adjust our pricing to certain sellers to more accurately reflect the value of the land utilized in our operations. We also believe our marketing efforts, international buyers is having a beneficial impact on ASPs. Despite the challenges caused by the stronger dollar, total bids from our international buyers were up over 42% over the same quarter last year. Measured by the business address of the buyer, total sales to international buyers was approximately 21%; however, based on the location of the IP address of the buyer sales to international buyers was approximately 32%. This does not capture the activity of buyers who have domestic physical addresses, bid locally then export the car. We believe it is not unreasonable to estimate as much as 35% of all our sales are for export. Another area of significant progress within Copart is that of data analytics and business intelligence. We have a team of data scientists utilizing new technologies, machine learning, and millions of data points we have systematically captured over the years to enhance and develop our products. We have a product called ProQuote, it's a tool used by our insurance partners to predict the proceeds that we generated at auction for any specific car. As you can imagine this is a very complex calculation including inputs like year, make, model, trend, auction passages of the car, nature and severity of the damage, proximity to a port of export, seed and scrap metal evaluation trends and many-many others. Next week we will release our fourth new version of this product in the last 12 months. By using gradient boosting we have improved the accuracy of that prediction by 34% thereby allowing insurance companies to make better repair versus salvage decisions. Due to the electronic nature of our auction platform we can capture all the search and bidding activity including product preferences and bidding tendencies. Utilizing that data we made when appropriate the extent our electronic auctions in anticipation of further activity. During the quarter this new capability generated millions in additional gross proceeds for our insurance partners. Finally we're using data and data technology to enhance our yard configuration and work flow to increase the capacity and efficiency of our operations. Turning to the UK, we generated another strong quarter. We saw marginal decline in units sold resulting in part from our decision to eliminate the low margin cars from our direct purchase program and to eliminate in total our municipality program. Nevertheless, expressed in GDP, revenue was flat and EBIT grew by almost 10% as we increased the yield per car. Germany continued to deliver impressive auction results with low volumes. We hold biweekly auctions for three insurance suppliers and two major rental car companies. Auction buyers' participation continues to exceed our expectations as the number of participants and the number of unique bidders per auction are higher than those same metrics in North America. Returns achieved through our Copart auctions in Germany significantly exceed those achieved through the existing re-marketing conventions. Key to growth in volume in Germany is the expansion of our network to facilities. In addition to the sole operational facility which is located near Hanover, we have purchased around the process of developing two new facilities, one near Berlin and the other near Leipzig. We expect to begin the phasing-in operations at these locations this calendar year. We continue our efforts to open at least three other new facilities in the country. We're also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil where revenue and EBIT were both up over 20%. As our Brazilian operations mature and continue to gain market share, we believe it to be a more meaningful contributor in the future to our financial performance. Nevertheless, on overall basis and for the quarter, our operations outside of North America and the UK while profitable remained immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. We are seeing rising diesel fuel, labor and health insurance costs. Nevertheless, on a consolidated basis and excluding a normal cost associated with Hurricane Harvey and the $2.6 million special bonus paid to our operation employees, which was tied to the recent change in corporate tax, our average cost of process of each car grew only marginally over the same quarter last year. We remain focused on controlling our G&A expense and we are pleased with our efforts to gain leverage by limiting its growth. Total G&A expense for the quarter was $34.7 million which included $1.8 million of additional G&A expense associated with the NPA operations. Excluding the additional NPA cost, G&A remained very consistent with the prior three quarters despite the increases in both unit volume and the number of yards. As a percentage of revenue, our G&A expense has remained below 9% of revenue as we strive to operate in a lean and efficient manner.  Our inventory in North America was up 8.6%. Excluding all CAT units from this quarter and the same quarter last year, North America inventory was up 8.7%. Inventory outside of North America was up 3.9%. At this point, we have a clear picture of the impact of Hurricane Harvey on our financial results. Overall, we expect to lose approximately $8.2 million on the event. As always, we conducted a comprehensive post event review and our performance to identify areas of improvement and to prepare for the next cat. We have identified several areas in which we can improve operational efficiency through better use of technology and data, most notably the recovery of the flood cars. We have also identified areas where through the expansion of our cat equipment fleet in mobile facilities, we can improve the experience, comfort and efficiency of our insurance companies' employees and their policyholders as we are currently procuring and outfitting equipment in those mobile facilities.  While cost associated with our response to Harvey were high, they were necessary provide the level of service expected by our insurance companies. Within days of the event, both before and after, we secured over 750 acres of temporary storage capacity at a cost of over $15 million. We've diverted all of our appropriate machinery and equipment of our construction company to the region even before the storm hit land to prepare and manage these facilities. We called on over 660 people who are seasoned members of our CAT team to temporarily relocate to the Huston area. To supplement the 58 loaders we initially dedicated to CAT, we procured on an expedited basis, 22 more loaders are at cost of $4 million. Our marketing team developed international marketing campaigns specifically for flood cars that resulted in 55% of all Harvey units during the first time flood buyers and an estimated 37% of the product going offshore, including a disproportionately high volume going to Latin America and the Middle East. Our IT team was on site day one establishing connectivity for communications and for our operations. Regarding land, while we know there will be another CAT at Huston, we also know the likelihood of gaining access of land used in this CAT is remote. In fact, we know that 450 acres of land we use will become a residential development. Accordingly, we have developed more permanent solution for Huston. We have expanded our existing facility. We have purchased and are currently developing a new operating facility of across more 240 acres, and we have a non-operational CAT only facility of 150 acres. This more permanent CAT land solution has been executed in Huston. It's just a continuation of our broader strategy that will help to cover the entire Gulf and Atlantic hurricane exposure areas. In addition to Huston, last year, we announced the acquisition of 162 acre non-operational CAT facility in Okeechobee, Florida to address CAT needs in Miami, Tampa and Orlando. And in fact this facility was utilized to address CAT volume from Hurricane Irma. In the current quarter, we purchased a 211 acre non-operational facility Theodore, Alabama, which will serve CAT needs from New Orleans, and can handle Florida. Now let me address our non-CAT lands needs. Over the last 15 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly volume growth rate has averaged 10.8%. We have previously discussed extensively the driver of that growth. Increased accident frequency and increased total loss frequency, while the growth rate in accident frequency is moderating, we see no such trend in total loss frequency. In the most recent report from CCC, total loss frequency is up 6.5%. Further, we believe there is a reasonable expectation that total loss frequency may accelerate due to the anticipated decline in used car pricing. Historical data suggest the used car price declines as off-lease volume increases as a percentage of new car sales. Accordingly, we are extensively-- excuse me, extremely active in our yard expansion program, while we did not announce the opening of any yards this quarter. Activity continues at an elevated pace. During the quarter, we closed 14 land transactions including new yards or yard expansion in Salt Lake City, Ogden Utah, Memphis, San Antonio, Atlanta, Tampa, Boston Minneapolis and Milwaukee, all of which either are or will soon be in development. Last year April, we acquired our own construction company to more efficiently and cost effectively developed our new yards. Currently, we have nine new years or yard expansions and development. Within three months, we expect 11 more yards or yard expansions to begin. That concludes my comments, I'll turn now turn the call back over to the moderator for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we would like open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities. Bob Labick : I wanted to start with Germany, making progress there, you mentioned last quarter that you had -- you were starting to build out two other yards. Can you just give us an update on that progress, how it\u2019s going? And is it, when you get those yards more insurance companies will come? Because I think you were three last time as well, what's -- give us maybe some milestones in Germany as to how that should play out this year please? Jay Adair : Sure, we have two that are on schedule, one that we should begin construction on with the next two weeks, the other in Berlin which will probably be in the next two months. And we have I think very viable targets in two other cities. We really don't expect to see an expansion of our volume until we get this network in place due to the cost to hold these cars, but we're more confident than ever of the success of our product offering in this region and we're progressing full speed ahead. Bob Labick : Okay great. And are there any emerging competitive threats? Or is the only threat to your expansion there really just status quo? And how does the rest of Europe look going forward. Jay Adair : No, there's really no one to offer what we do. The market in Europe is primarily with the insurance companies pay to the policy holders, the diminished value of their vehicle and then it\u2019s up to the policy holder to recover the balance of the value through selling that vehicle. So what we offer is completely different model, but one I think will be welcomed by the market there in Europe. Bob Labick : Okay great. And then last point just jumping, the non-insurance growth in the U.S. remains very strong and excluding NPA as well. Can you just talk about, you've mentioned a little bit about focusing more on dealer versus charity, any other drivers there? And what you've been doing differently to have such strong growth? Jeff Liaw : I think we're finding areas in which we can maximize the sale proceeds of these non-franchise dealer cars. We have developed internal teams that help with counter bidding and because the elevated returns that we're achieving, we're aggregating more volume from franchise, that's primarily independent dealers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu, Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask on the vehicle sales line item, up nearly 45% year over year and that's kind of a trend change from what we've seen over the last several quarters. I am wondering how much of those driven by the hurricane? What are some of the factors that driving that growth rate so substantially higher? Jeff Liaw : Sure, Ben. This is Jeff. And I will jump here and just a brief reminder before I get even into the substance. I think the purchased car math I think it's sometimes misleading because we\u2019ve recognized them as revenue for the full selling price of the car. They always look more meaningful at place in the P&L than they actually are to the operations of the business where they are 14% of revenues, but well less than 5% even though of actual units sold. So purchased cars include a variety of sourced cars including the Copart direct business, which you\u2019ve heard us talk about on prior calls as well. There are countries in which we operate that have a higher mix of purchased cars as well, including the UK for example as you already know, among many other drivers. So I treat the variability in this quarter as largely noise and more than anything else and with less of effect -- less of an effect on the bottom line that might first appear from the headline number. Ben Bienvenu : And then I want to pan out a little bit and think about the capacity expansion that you\u2019ve added to the business, obviously total loss rates have driven pretty steadily over the course of the last several years. Active rates going higher, but we\u2019ve had an absence what I characterize as normal winter. How do you feel about your ability to handle the sell throughput in light of more normal winter that we\u2019ve seen at least in calendar 1Q to-date? Where does your capacity stand to absorb what I think would be more normalized volume in that environment? Jay Adair : Well, we\u2019re addressing that on several different fronts. First and most obvious ones is we are expanding our land capacity. Secondly, we are developing new ways to handle the cars which allows us to draw more cars on the same facility, and that we\u2019re exploring in place that we can to reduce the cycle time to get the cars sold faster. In the past we\u2019ve announced a tremendous investment of land, I think we were between roughly 700 acres last year we\u2019ll be in that range this year. And we don\u2019t see the need for land abating in the next few years. Jeff Liaw : Ben, I think you just heard both sides from Will, which are both true, which is one. We are confident in our ability to provide excellent service with Copart standards to our customers including in weather scenarios that you described, but also that you've now seen multiple years of highly elevated capital expenditures, which is a reflection of our expectation that we need still more. As you know already, land and capacity, we always talk about it on the earnings call as a big sweeping concept. It\u2019s very much market-by-market individual city even regions of a given city basis. So, we study that very carefully and we invest accordingly on truly micro economy basis. Ben Bienvenu : And then last question from me, it's sort of housekeeping around tax rate. Jeff, thanks for the color provided in the release today. I want to make sure that I am thinking about this correctly. Given your targeted rate for the full year for the fiscal year 26.9%, I am inferring around the 25% tax rate for the back half. Is that the way that we should be thinking about go forward tax rate? Jeff Liaw : No, so first clarification is that 26.9% is strictly U.S. federal, so already the Copart pays the U.S. federal tax we pay state income tax as well and then we pay foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we do business, principally to-date the UK. So all of that historically has blended to a 34% to 36% rate for the past few years, so for Q2, 2018, and for all of fiscal '18 frankly we will pay U.S. federal tax rate and accrue at 26.9%, so Q2 reflects that, it also reflects a \"correction\" because Q1 was accrued at 35% initially. So for the balance of the year for U.S. federal tax rates only, we should expect to see an accrual of 26.9%. By the time it blend its way into our actual P&L number will be at a little bit. But that's the fiscal '18 implication is the input is the 26.9% U.S. federal rate. In 2019, fiscal '19 and beyond our U.S. federal tax rate will be 21. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit about the increase in the international buyer bids? And obviously you're saying maybe 35% of your volume is being exported. Is there anything going on I guess beyond a weaker dollar that is driving that? And I guess from an import export, is there anything politically going on? Are we hearing about import duties on metals, is there anything that could shift that trend going forward? Jay Adair : No, I think that the difference is the way we're measuring it. We can be more accurate and how we determine where the bid is actually coming on, instead of relying on their address that they provide us when they sign up. They're relying on their IP address where the bids, what the bid is received. And based on that, we're providing a more accurate number. But despite that, even however you measure it, our international activity is growing, and much of that based on our marketing efforts targeting our international buyers. We have buyers for the first time last quarter from a single CF Ireland. And every quarter seems like we have one or two new countries that are bidding. And so we expect that our international influence on our ASP is to continue to grow. Jeff Liaw : Bret, I'll add a little bit of color there too. You've heard the commentary we made about ASPs rising and the underlying progress there being newer cars on average as well as waste damaged cars on average. When the population of cars shifts in that direction, I think it naturally expands the available universe of buyers including foreign buyers. But the less damage to newer cars the more focus that might be interested including foreign buyers who can put those cars back on the road in their respective countries. So I think that's part of the story too. But for sure, as we've articulated the big headwind shift key might have in your head from the below 20% to 35% so that's the measurement difference that you described. And Bret more precisely addressed your question about trade heightened trade barriers if that eventually comes to past. I think the short answer is that all kinds of first and second order complications that I don't think anyone compare to client on fox at this point. Certainly, if you saw, if you saw increased barriers to products getting in the U.S. from outside the U.S., you could imagine that the value of the salvage car that's here domestically with a number of impacts parts and the re-buildable platform could do worth more. You could also see a scenario where you describe in which the international buyers who have helped to increase ASPs in U.S. that could be net harmful. So hard to say where that shakes out, I don't think any of these has a clear not to give it vision of where that might end up in terms of the trade implications themselves. Bret Jordan : A quick follow-up on you commented on adjusting pricing to certain sellers to reflect the land values. Could you give us a little bit more detail as to which certain sellers and how much of an adjustment? Jay Adair : No, really we can't -- while we're on the specifics, you can imagine that the sellers are bringing us more valuable cars would have preferential pricing in that consideration, and you can probably also understand the charity cars and cars are received from municipalities are very low on value. And despite that they're low on value, they consume the same amount of land and typically has cycle times that maybe even longer than insurance car. So, they're far less attractive to us on verall basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman, JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Just a follow-up on the earlier conversation about Germany. Can you elaborate on the, the early reaction from customers given how different your service is from the model that was prevalent before your arrival? And what that might mean for the ultimate growth potential in Germany which you commented on before? And then could you provide too, sort of an update on some of the other places you've recently expanded into you know in recent areas like India for example. Now what are you learning there about whether that's a market you want to continue to invest in and what the ultimate growth potential could be in that country? Jay Adair : So, I'll start with Germany. So, the feedback has been very positive. The policyholders obviously love the fact that they can collect a check and then walk away and buy a new car without having to touch the check and simply the diminished value of their car and then to sell the damaged car to aggregate enough cash to go buy a new replacement. Yes and it's more beneficial for the buyers too. In the car market, a buyer in Germany may bid on a car and then he has to wait 21 days to find out if the car will ultimately be awarded to him. In our convention, a buyer knows within days whether he has the car and he can better plan his business and his inventory management. Our challenge before us is just to build out the infrastructure to take advantage of this beneficial product offering that we provide and it's not a simple task. Obtaining land in Germany is every bit a lot more difficult than obtaining land in areas like Miami and Los Angeles in the United States, and it\u2019s taken us some time but we're well on our way. We've got, like you said we got one in operations, we have two that are beginning construction, only have two other sites that we feel very comfortable we should close on the next months, that\u2019s in Germany. And every country is different, and so you asked about India. The prospects in India are not as bright as they are in what we've seen in Germany, and we\u2019ll make the correct decisions in addressing the potential and best allocation of our national resources going forward. Ryan Brinkman : And then just lastly for me, how should we think about management's priorities for the use of the incremental cash flows provided by the lower tax rate? I see the one-time bonuses to the employees, but relative to your prior plan. Do you think you'll use the excess cash flows to accelerate organic growth and would that be domestic or international or potentially to repurchase more shares than you otherwise would have or some other purpose? Jay Adair : Let me just add before I turn it over to Jeff. Let me add, it was more than just a one-time bonus. We actually had seen increases for a number of job classifications in our operational side of our business. Jeff Liaw : So in response to your question, I think we invest to grow our business organically to provide outstanding service to our customer and you can see it reflected over a very long period of time Copart\u2019s generally very conservative financial practices because we want to be relatively unconstrained when it come to serving our customers well and to servicing their needs. We also expect to continue to invest internationally. We talked further about Germany today. Western Europe has been big strategic non-U.S. priority for us that likely will consume a substantial amount of capital as well. As we\u2019ve always said, the ultimate residual is returns. Of course we historically have pursued share buybacks. I don\u2019t think the tax reform per se changes the timing of how we approach that. It\u2019s as you can tell historically very lumpy by nature but that\u2019s ultimately the lever that we will use, so no immediate triggers but ultimately that is the result of incremental cash generating. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Matthew Paige, Gabelli. Matthew Paige : I just wanted to quickly follow up on Hurricane Harvey. I think in the past you\u2019ve noted that you expected about 85,000 vehicles. Is that still a target number? And could you just give an update on how many parties sold through? Jay Adair : So hurricane and we think of for us what Hurricane Harvey and Irma being contemporaneous and Harvey being much larger of course. We have sold approximately 85,000 units to-date and through the first two quarters of fiscal \u201818 and we have approximately 7,500 units or so remaining. Matthew Paige : And then lastly from me maybe thinking bigger picture, you made acquisitions -- are there adjacent in-markets especially in auction space that you think your technology would work in? Jay Adair : It\u2019s a fair question, nothing specifically. So we know what the job one is which is to service our customers exceedingly well and job two is to expand internationally in the markets we talked about. We will always explore specific adjacencies. We want to be thoughtful about it. As you heard us describe on prior calls, the NPA acquisition made sense for us both because we liked it as an investment and financial rebalance because we thought it was a strategic benefit to our core business. That will likely always be the baseline test, any meaningful expected to be on that will have to meet a very high hurdle. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Just want to touch on the dealer cars. Good strength there on the growth on units, but first of all, with your program with the dealers. Can a dealer put their car on your system through a mobile means and sell it that way rather have to take it to a site or do they stop to take it to one of your facilities to sell it? Jay Adair : No, they have to bring it in. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Is there any plan to do something like that where the dealer would not have to bring it in and he could just do it through a mobile phone, upload everything? Jay Adair : Not at this point. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And in terms of the transactional base, are the buyers mostly independent dealers, the sellers or mostly franchise dealers? Is that how these vehicles are flowing from buyer to seller? Jay Adair : Yes, the sellers are mostly independent, yes, mostly independent. We have two franchises, they're mostly independent. And it's going everywhere. So it would be hard for me to single out one particular pocket of buyers that is significantly more important than others. A lot of these cars are going offshore. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then lastly Jeff, I just want to make sure I'm clear on this, because I'm not. In terms of what we start looking as the tax rates for the back half of the year and next year. When you talk about the U.S. tax rate, but is there any way you could probably just give us what your all in blended tax rate is going to be the back half for the year and for fiscal '19? Jeff Liaw : No, unfortunately, Gary, I think, the U.S. federal tax rate historically has been a very good starting point for estimating our overall rate. But coincidently our overall rate similar because we have net offsetting benefits of relatively lower rates in the UK. But again offset and lifted by U.S. state tax rates in turn. The point I was trying to make was in Q2 of '18, you have the noise of not that the lower rates year-over-year. You also have noise of the $7.6 we are effectively releasing from the Q1, right. Q3 and Q4 will just have a fairly clean 26.9% U.S. federal tax rate. We haven't historically provided any guidance beyond that, but that's then starting point for Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Out next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : I want to focus first I guess the dealers. What exactly is to writing that? Is it more like your efforts trying to get more of these dealers to sell out of value trade in to your sales other than scrap yards? Or trying to understand where the higher supply of these cars actually coming from? Jay Adair : Yes, mostly it's -- we're meeting their expectations in terms of returns where we're getting higher returns and therefore that's driving higher volumes. And we've had a number of programs in place that are helping us in that respect. But we seen a returns increased significantly over the last 4 to 6 quarters on the dealer cars. Chris Bottiglieri : Are there any other like supplementary market factors that are driving like repossessions or anything like that that mostly in your efforts? Jay Adair : Mostly, it's our own efforts. We've developed some programs and some expertises, and some internal processes that are allowing us to yield a higher return. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. And then related, vaguely, you might be calling out a market share win in the prepared comments. Is there any big account? Or was it kind a just broad based or just general comments you're making? And it was just new to the quarter just kind a more commentary on that? Jay Adair : I'm not sure any essential shift this quarter. Chris Bottiglieri : No essentials, okay. All right, And then just finally, when you think of these CATs, pretty small loss. Sounds like i.e. something comparable maybe small gain in those. But when you think about the CAT frequency unfortunately similarly picking up be kind a more recurring event and then. Is it largely an entry of the duopoly of high barriers to entry? And you both made these massive permanent land investments. How you start thinking about these CATs going forward? Do you think there's any ability to price these more effectively to be compensated for pretty strenuous efforts? And is there a point where you can make in Miami as a part of recurring ordinary event? Jay Adair : In the past we have not, we have not adjusted OME special pricing for CATs, and right now I can\u2019t say there's any discussion that's been entertained about doing so. Jeff Liaw : And there's going also I just wanted to jump in on the premise if your question too, we've felt pretty meaningful financial effect across the first six months of the year, a $9 million net operating profit loss, and we don't expect to make that up in any means or degree. I'll also add for the prepared commentary that, that in fact doesn't even count to very meaningful capital expenditures we've made in anticipation of these catastrophic events and in response to them. So these are major financial burdens for us, no question on balance, as Will articulate that simply what it takes to provide Copart service to our customers. As to your question about pricing, I think we view it as part of the cost of doing business to provide exceptional service to our customers. So, we historically have not, as Will noted, -- have not adjusted pricing accordingly for those moments in time. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Jeff Liaw : All right, thank you Chantelle and thank you everyone. As you can see from the results of the quartet, we're quite happy with how things look with the CATs primarily behind us, I just want to point out our people have done a fabulous job. We've been out in the field speaking to those folks and I know they're proud to work for Copart, and we\u2019re proud of them. So we appreciate all the hard work and the effort and look forward to reporting on Q3 on the next call. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen at this time this conference is now concluded. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.",

Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Gary Prestopino - Barrington Craig Kennison - Baird Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Liaw, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I will start with the Safe Harbor in a moment. I am joined today by Executive Vice President, Will Franklin, who will also provide additional commentary on the business. First, the Safe Harbor, during today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of foreign currency related gains and losses, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related fees, certain income tax benefits, foreign income tax credit limitations and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We have provided the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of these risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that maybe made from time-to-time on our behalf. Now, I will transition to a review of Copart\u2019s third quarter. We are pleased to report all-time highs for Copart\u2019s in unit sales, revenue, gross profits and operating income. We experienced global revenue growth of 27.9%, including a beneficial year-over-year currency effect of $8.6 million primarily due to relative strength in the British pound. Excluding Hurricane Harvey which had a modest effect on the quarter, we experienced revenue growth of 27%. Global unit sales grew at 12% versus the third quarter of last year with U.S. unit growth of 12.7% and international unit growth of 8.5%. Our growth in the U.S. has been driven by market growth, customer wins and acquisitions. Inventory worldwide grew at 8% year-over-year, less than 1% of the inventory at the end of the quarter, were catastrophic vehicles related to weather events and approximately 1% of the inventory growth is attributable to acquisitions, which we will comment on later in the call. Service revenue grew $78.4 million versus last year or 23.6% and purchase car revenue grew $25.9 million or 62.4% in that case due to acquisitions and growth in certain European markets. Our gross profit grew from $172.5 million a year ago to $219.1 million this year with a slight decrease in gross margins from 46.1% to 45.8% driven by a slightly higher vehicle sales mix and importantly Hurricane Harvey expenditures of $7.4 million for the quarter. I will pause here to talk about average selling prices, which as you know are a driver of our business. We experienced improvement in ASPs year-over-year of approximately 17% in the U.S., 16% ex-catastrophic cars. Continuing the themes you have heard us talk about on the last few calls, the underlying drivers of the sales price improvements have included are auction performance and member recruitment, but additionally also newer cars being totaled, less severely damaged cars, more bidding activity, a reasonably healthy used car price environment, and a solid scrap environment as well. Will will additionally comment on this matter further in our call. I noted a moment ago that our gross margin was affected by excess catastrophic expenses of $7.4 million in the quarter. After taking into account revenue from those same catastrophic events, Hurricane Harvey represented a net effect of $3.9 million operating loss for the quarter and a $12.8 million loss through the first 9 months of fiscal 2018. Turning our attention to general and administrative expenses, they were up from $32.5 million a year ago to $39.1 million this year ex-depreciation and amortization with almost half of the increase due to acquisitions. As we have noted consistently, our general and administrative expenditures will grow over time with inflation and with increasing complexity in the business. We continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the top line growth rates we have experienced. Our GAAP operating income grew from $136.8 million a year ago to $174.6 million this year or 27.7% change. Excluding that catastrophic loss of $3.9 million I noted a moment ago, our operating income growth would have been 30.5%. We have shown slight operating margin expansion despite the modest shift towards vehicle sales revenue. Our net interest expense for the quarter was down from $5.5 million a year ago to $4.1 million this year due largely to a lower debt balance offset slightly by higher interest rates \u2013 higher risk-free interest rates. Our third quarter income taxes reflect the benefit of course of a lower year-over-year effective tax rates by virtue of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The income taxes for the 9-month period reflects the complexities of the one-time transition tax accrual of approximately $10 million on repatriated foreign earnings, which will be paid over the next 8 years and is subject to further guidance and fine-tuning from the IRS. As we have noted on the last call, we will experience a reduction in our U.S. federal tax rate this year from 35% last year to 26.9% in fiscal \u201818 due to our straddling the calendar year with our fiscal year. Our fiscal \u201819 tax rate then will be lower still to account for the full year benefit of a 21% federal tax rate versus the 26.9% federal tax rate we will experience here in fiscal \u201818. Our GAAP net income increased from $90.5 million to $127.3 million or 40.6% growth year-over-year due largely to revenue growth as well as the benefits of tax rate changes. On a non-GAAP basis in the schedule we provided to you, we reflected growth in net income from $86.4 million to $125 million growth of 44.7%. This in both cases excludes the book tax benefits of our early adoption of ASU 2016-09 regarding the tax treatment for stock option exercises. Of $3.1 million in the third quarter of \u201818 and $4.0 million in the third quarter of \u201817 it also excludes currency-related gains on cash balances of $0.3 million in the third quarter of \u201818 and $0.2 million of losses in the third quarter of \u201817. Our effective share count has increased slightly from 235.4 million to 239.9 million largely attributable to increases in our share price. Our non-GAAP EPS increased substantially from $0.37 a year ago to $0.52 this year. A few notes on cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $190.8 million compared to $192.2 million a year ago due to substantially increased cash earnings in the current year offset by significant a cash tax benefit in the third quarter of \u201817. Our CapEx was $68.8 million consistent with prior quarters, of which over 90% is for land and development continuing our land and facilities expansion program. We do expect that investment profile to remain elevated in the quarters and years to come. One last comment and I will turn it over to Will. This week, we received a jury verdict in our favor of a net $16 million in the finding of professional negligence and fraud against Sparta Consulting now known as KPIT, a systems implementation farm we had business dealings with ending in 2013. In accordance with GAAP, this verdict is not yet reflected in our financial statements. With that, I will turn it over to Will Franklin, Executive Vice President. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. Let me provide some operational narrative around Copart performance for the quarter. Some of my comments may seem familiar. However, they remain appropriate as we have not seen a meaningful change in the market dynamics for the direction of our efforts. In the U.S., our tremendous growth in revenue was primarily driven by increased volume, which on a year-over-year basis was 12.7%. Excluding Harvey, it was 11.9% and was driven once again by organic growth and wins within the insurance market and continued growth in most of our non-insurance segments and acquisitions. Total volume from non-insurance sellers, which include franchise and independent dealers, finance companies who give us the repossessions in off-lease vehicles, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and brokers, grew by almost 38%. Within the non-insurance market, we are seeing a shift in mix as growth in volume from dealers and financial institutions was up almost 83%, while volume from municipalities and other low margin sellers declined as we continue to dedicate our limited land capacity to the more profitable segments. Volume from dealers and financial institutions are typically run and drive vehicles that yield an average ASP and an average gross margin significantly greater in insurance cars, while at the same time having a shorter cycle time. In total, non-insurance cars represented almost 21% of total car volume in the U.S. We believe growth in these non-insurance markets is attributable to the introduction of new programs, services and brands targeting each segments\u2019 specific needs as well as our ability to deliver outstanding auction results. In the U.S., our service revenue per car on a quarter-over-quarter basis is up approximately 9%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs. As Jeff has said and I will illustrate a little further the increase in ASPs were driven by a number of factors. The value of used cars as measured by Manheim Index was up almost 6%, the value of crushed car bodies as measured by indexes maintained by American Recycler were up over 13%. The beneficial mix of cars sold has previously discussed and increased bidding activity as both the number of unique auction participants and the number of bids per car are up significantly year-over-year. Further, we are seeing a trend from the insurance companies in which they are totaling cars that are less severely damaged. As the high returns we are generating for those types of cars and the increase in repair costs makes such a shift warranted. We are seeing a significant benefit from our international buyers as total bidding activity from this group is up over 46% year-over-year. The percentage of the value of cars sold to the international buyers based on the buyers\u2019 business address increased over 10% and stands at 22.3%. However, we know this percentage significantly understates the number of cars being exported as many exporters have domestic addresses. Based on the IP address, we estimate 30% to 35% of all cars sold in the U.S. are ultimately exported. During this quarter, Jordan became our fourth largest export market following Mexico, UAE and Nigeria. Canada continues its remarkable growth. Year-over-year volume grew by over 45%. As our Canadian leadership team matures, our infrastructure expands and we grow our share of the Canadian market. Due to this growth, we are actively searching for land in Moncton, Halifax and Toronto and we will soon be announcing a significant expansion of our yard in Edmonton. Turning to the UK, we are also generating another strong quarter. We saw a marginal growth in the units sold resulting in part from our decision to eliminate the low margin cars from our direct purchase program and to eliminate in total cars sold from certain municipalities. Nevertheless, expressed in GDP, revenue grew almost 10% as these strategic moves resulted in significantly higher yields per car. Volumes in Germany continue to grow. Volumes for March and April were more than double the run-rate for the previous 4 months. We have now entered into arrangements on a limited basis to market cars before insurance companies and 3 rental car companies. We hold biweekly auctions at our Hanover yard and in April we had our first auction at our new Leipzig yard. The Leipzig auction will continue to be held on a monthly basis. We are also very pleased with our German auction results. Auction buyer participation continues to exceed our expectations as the number of participants and the number of unique bidders per auction, are actually higher than those same metrics for North America. Returns achieved through our German Copart auctions significantly exceed those achieved through the existing remarketing conventions currently available to the German insurance industry. Key to growth in volume in Germany is the expansion of our network of facilities. In addition to our operational facility near Hanover, which was opened in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 and our new facility in Leipzig which while not officially opened is in a state of development that allows us to hold auctions. We have 5 other locations in Germany targeted for acquisition and development, including Germany on which we expect to break ground within the next two quarters. In March, we announced the acquisition of AVK, a salvage operation in Finland. AVK has four yards and a robust base of buyers, including buyers in Russia and the Baltic States. It was an opportunistic acquisition and it bids in well with our goal of expanding our footprint throughout all of Europe. We are also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil, were expressed in reals, revenue grew by almost 16%. As our Brazilian operations mature and we continue to gain market share, we expect it become a more meaningful contributor to our overall financial performance. Turning to our operating cost, we are seeing rising diesel fuel, labor and health insurance costs. These increases have impacted our average cost to process each car. On a consolidated basis and excluding abnormal cost, with Hurricane Harvey, our average cost to process each car grew marginally over the same quarter last year. Our inventory in North America was up 7.3%. Inventory outside of North America was up 13.6% and consolidated inventory was up 8%. As we have previously discussed extensively, the drivers for the growth in North America total loss market. We will continue \u2013 we see the continued trends in both accident frequency, total loss frequency and growth in car park. We expect to see continued growth in car park and accident frequency. Car park growth has been driven by new car sales, which have remained surprisingly robust with the SAR hovering around $17 million and more importantly by the decline in used car scrappage, there is number of registered cars over 10 years old continues to grow. We also expect continued growth in total loss frequency as we believe car complexity in terms of materials, technology and manufacturing tranches will accelerate the growth in repair cost, while at the same time, our scale, technology and member recruitment efforts both domestically and internationally will continue the current trend of increasing auction returns. Last quarter, our North America volume, excluding cats grew by over 10%. Over the last 17 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly volume growth has averaged 10.9%. Accordingly, we continue to be extremely active in our yard expansion programs. While we did not announce the opening of any new yards in North America this quarter, we did announce the expansion of 4 existing facilities. Additionally during the quarter, we closed 7 new land transactions, including 3 lease buyouts. We now own over 80% of our land. In total, we imposed on 22 land transactions in the last two quarters. We currently have 18 land development projects under construction, which when completed will deliver over 658 person capacity and includes a non-operational cat yard of over 100 acres in North Carolina. That concludes my brief remarks. Now, I will turn the call over to Kathy for the Q&A session. Kathy? Operator : Our first question comes from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. Bob Labick : It\u2019s a great quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Bob Labick : Couple of questions. One to start with cycle times, volumes remain very strong inventory growth is as strong as well but volumes continue to exceed that. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers behind that if you are seeing changes in cycle times, and if so, how you are achieving that or how you are getting the throughput that you are getting? Jeff Liaw : Not sure I understand your question, Bob. Do you mind elaborate and give me? Bob Labick : Sure. Inventories update and volumes in the subsequent quarter are up 12 and typically maybe it would have been I know it\u2019s never the same every quarter, but they usually will line up over a number of quarters. We have been seeing trends of multiple quarters with the volumes exceeding the inventory, which could imply increased cycle times or I guess decreased cycle times on the lot. And so I was just trying to see if you could talk a little bit about the flow-through of cars and perhaps it\u2019s related to the shift to non-insurance that Will talked about on the run and drive cars or any explanation or helpful color behind that would be great? Jeff Liaw : Sure. I\u2019d say, broadly speaking, Bob there hasn\u2019t been any systemic shift in cycle time in terms of what it takes for us to process a car through the Copart system. I think as you note that Will did provide the additional color today that the growth in our non-insurance business, it ebbs and flows relative to the insurance business in the past quarter plus the growth has substantially outpaced our insurance growth. Therefore, the cycle times on those cars are certainly shorter and that has helped to drive some of the outperformance of unit sales, but no, not an underlying systematic shift in the business. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just a little more color regarding that shift to non-insurance, is it a quarterly ebb and flow, is it a longer term shift we could expect to see in the future or how are you thinking about the shift to non-insurance and then the shift within non-insurance? Jeff Liaw : So, when I said \u2013 and I misspoke and so when I say ebb and flow I certainly don\u2019t mean the growth in the business, the growth has been consistent. I just mean that we have had calls in the past few years, for example, in which the insurance growth outpaced the non-insurance group. The non-insurance business has grown consistently. We think it\u2019s a reflection in part of our excellent auction results, our member recruitment, which is a virtuous cycle. So, the dealers and the like are achieving excellent results and therefore are more inclined still to consign cars through Copart. As for the shift among non-insurance, we tend to talk about it as one chunk of business. As Will noted, the business is very different. There are dealer cars certainly financial institutions as well and charity volumes as well recognizing we have scarce resources. We of course wanted to deliver, first and foremost, excellent results and excellent service to our insurance carriers, but also to our non-insurance providers. We have to prioritize accordingly within that segment. That\u2019s why you heard Will described growth in the dealer segment, for example, outpacing growth in our charities volumes. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, great and thank you for the color on Germany. It sounds like things are going really well. So I won\u2019t ask questions on that, but I will ask \u2013 you mentioned Brazil, it was exciting topic a couple of years ago and kind of got superseded so to speak by Europe. Can you just give us a little update on the market in Brazil and how that is progressing and maturing? Jeff Liaw : Sure. I will provide some comments and Will can jump in as well. I think the Brazilian investment at the outset we made is a long-term strategic play for Copart. We were temporarily affected of course by Brazilian macroeconomic and social issues that caused, for example, the currency to create relative to the dollar. In and of itself, the Brazilian business has performed quite well. And we, as you heard today, we believe our growth prospects there remain quite promising. So, the business is doing well. Absent the currency and macro issues about that that economy has faced over the past few years, I would say the trajectory has been very strong for us. Bob Labick : Okay, great. And then last one, I will jump back in. The G&A, you noted, Jim, from the acquisition and other growth, is there kind of a quarterly run-rate? Is this the right run rate or that we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis? Jeff Liaw : As you know, Bob, we don\u2019t provide any forward guidance. I think we have been consistent in saying that always taking a multiple quarter view on things like G&A and it is the right analytical approach. So, I wouldn\u2019t take one low quarter or one high quarter and necessarily extrapolate forever off of that basis alone. So the acquisitions that you heard us describe were NPA and the Finland business, AVK, which we acquired as well. NPA, I think you know heard almost a year ago. AVK is smaller in comparison. I would take a multiple quarter view as opposed to extrapolating solely from the third quarter, the second quarter, or the first quarter alone. Bob Labick : Great. Thanks so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Hi, good morning guys. Nice quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Ben Bienvenu : I wanted to ask about the cash generation of the business. It is significant you have shown at least episodically a willingness to acquire. I know Europe is kind of the next frontier of growth for you guys. To what extent are there incremental acquisition opportunities like AVK versus just building that out organically and how do you envision deploying cash and prioritizing your cash flows deployment over the next several years? Jeff Liaw : Sure. Thanks, Ben. We always remain open of course to strategic investments that help to enhance our core business and/or themselves financially attractive. So we of course wouldn\u2019t rule anything out in that regard. That said, the major European markets that we are pursuing in earnest is Germany most prominently among them don\u2019t have like-for-like Copart auction model businesses in them. So, we are developing the business for the first time in those countries as opposed to acquiring existing enterprises. So if they happen, they won\u2019t be substantial acquisitions in the core markets in which we are participating today. Ben Bienvenu : Understood. And then just a clarifier follow-up on the whole car non-insurance business is that flowing both through the service and vehicle sales revenue and I have one quick clarifier on the vehicle sales revenue as well? Jeff Liaw : In short, yes both, but not disproportionately one way or the other. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. And then on the vehicle sales revenue, I think last quarter you had said that\u2019s predominantly being driven by ASP growth. Is that still the case today? And as you think about the growth within that business, do you expect to devote a similar amount of your own capital to sustaining volume growth there and if so why or why not? Jeff Liaw : You are talking specifically about our purchased car revenue, Ben? Ben Bienvenu : That\u2019s right, exactly. Jeff Liaw : No, so the ASPs would have a modest effect there, meaning for the same volume in this quarter versus a year ago, yes, selling prices are higher and so that has caused some of the lift. I think there is a tendency to overweight the vehicle sales revenue, because it is a much bigger portion of the revenue, of course, than it is of our actual contribution, because in effect, the gross merchandise value, the GMV, is in the revenue number as opposed to the rest of our business. So, it\u2019s still small on balance. We don\u2019t view it as contributing or consuming a meaningful portion of Copart\u2019s capital base, I think its more noise than substance frankly in the P&L. Ben Bienvenu : Understood. Thanks a lot, Jeff. Best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : My question, just relative to the non-insurance business, how high do you think that your non-insurance mix could get over the next few years and what might mean for your profitability or margin? And then maybe just more generally, how would you sort of subdivide the opportunity between those kind of nontraditional salvage cars sold by non-insurers versus more whole car type of cars sold by dealers, etcetera, more similar to like Adesa and Manheim today? Jeff Liaw : Hey, Ryan. Thanks for the question. We are not prepared to comment on the forward market size or revenue size for Copart. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the growth potential for us remains substantial for those cars as we have demonstrated in this quarter and in recent quarters as well. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. And then just lastly, go ahead, please, yes. Will Franklin : Yes. We are not looking to change our model to go to live auction or to change the operational structure in our facilities. We are reaching out and trying to enhance and add volume that this flow within our model and if we can do so by introducing new brands or back office programs then we are very attracted to those opportunities. Ryan Brinkman : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly for me, I appreciate the color and the materially higher volume in Germany. I am curious if your experience there so far suggest that other continental European markets might be attractive for you to expand into with physical locations. Have you done any work on that potential opportunity and then when IAA as an independent company, do you think that they might represent more competition for you in international markets anything to think about there? Will Franklin : Yes. All of Europe is attractive market to us. Our focus right now is Germany. And if we are successful in Germany, we think that the rest of Europe will follow suit just by virtue of the fact that many insurance companies are pan-European and understanding the effort it takes to expand internationally, which is tremendous and it\u2019s just not a matter of learning the losses, developing the systems and buying and developing the facilities, which require not only time, but a lot of capital. It would take years for anyone to enter the market and compete against us at this point. Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it\u2019s worth noting here that Copart extended internationally or overseas more than a decade ago into the United Kingdom and the capital, the management bandwidth, the expertise, the technology it takes to pursue opportunities like that is substantial. So not commenting per se on what any competitors might do. We recognize the investment is substantial and that we control our own destiny. So, we intend to invest thoughtfully and aggressively to expand those markets and believe that it\u2019s largely in our control. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino of Barrington. Gary Prestopino : Good morning. Jeff Liaw : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : I wanted to touch on these non-insurance cars. Could you \u2013 non-insurance was about 21% of your volume this quarter. Do you have the number of what it was last year at this time on a percentage basis? Jeff Liaw : No, but we can get that for you. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then with this mix shift to dealer cars was up you said the units were up about 83%, are they starting to become more of a contributor to your non-insurance cars? I mean, relative to the charity cars or whatever how has that mix evolved over the last on a year-over-year basis, is it more than 50% dealer cars now? Jeff Liaw : In our non-insurance business, no, it\u2019s not. And let me give that, we were 16.1% in North America third quarter of last year for non-insurance. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So that\u2019s still pretty good. Jeff Liaw : Yes. And most of the growth, like we have said, has been with the higher end cars from dealers and financial institutions and these are really nice cars. They bring a high ASP. And we wouldn\u2019t be getting these cars if we weren\u2019t develop \u2013 returning a nice return to these suppliers. They can remarket these cars any place and they are selling to us. So, we are very happy with the returns that we are providing. We are very happy with some of these programs that we have put in place to help reduce friction at any point in the process for both the buyers and the sellers with respect to buying these cars. And we don\u2019t \u2013 while we don\u2019t make any predictions, we think the dynamics we are currently experiencing should continue. Gary Prestopino : Well, that\u2019s what I guess I am just trying to get at here to get an understanding and this is great that you are doing this, but whereas maybe a year or two ago, most of your account base may have been independent dealers with this product. It sounds like it\u2019s moving more towards franchise and maybe towards commercial consignors. Is that a correct assessment? Jeff Liaw : No, we really don\u2019t do much with franchise dealerships. It\u2019s just an expansion of our independent leadership program. Gary Prestopino : Okay, so alright, alright. Okay. So you are just getting \u2013 because of what you are doing and you are doing it well, you are just getting a more higher quality car from the independent dealers? Jeff Liaw : Yes, both in volume and in quality of their cars. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Jeff Liaw : You\u2019re welcome, Gary. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning and thanks for taking my question as well. This is on the German market again I think in the U.S., you have said that approximately 35% of your bidders are coming from outside the United States. I am wondering what that metric looks like in Germany and really to what extent you are able to leverage an existing buyer base that you have cultivated while those bidders were looking at U.S. cars maybe several years ago, but now can look at German cars today? Will Franklin : I don\u2019t think there has been an extensive utilization of U.S. buyers on the German market. I think they developed their own market, their own buyer base. I can tell you that in terms of the number or the volume of cars that are going outside of Germany is very, very high, approaching 80%, mostly the Eastern Europe and Poland. Craig Kennison : I guess that was my question. It was my understanding that many of those Eastern European buyers were one-time bidders at U.S. auctions and maybe you have been able to leverage that customer base to buy cars that are located in Germany? Will Franklin : No, we really haven\u2019t seen that. We did have a technical one and that remarketed cars under the old convention or I guess the existing convention for establishing residual values on salvage cars and many of those buyers are transitioning to the Copart platform, but we really haven\u2019t seen many of the U.S. buyers transitioning. Jeff Liaw : And Craig, further to that point as for the international activity on U.S. cars, that continues to rise year-over-year in terms of the number of bidders and the number of bids, the number of cars that go internationally, that trend for U.S. supplied cars continues to shift internationally. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then as it relates to your Finnish acquisition, to what extent does it bring new insurance customers or a new buyer base that you could leverage beyond what you are doing in Finland, but even with respect to other aspirations in Europe? Will Franklin : Well, actually, the acquisition was from an insurance consortium that owned this salvage enterprise. So, we feel very comfortable that we will retain that business. Frankly, there aren\u2019t many other options. One of the things that was attractive about it was the fact of enhancing our buyer base in Germany and other European locations. Craig Kennison : Great. Thanks and congratulations. Will Franklin : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So if we hit back on the I guess non-salvage vehicles for a second. Could you tell us like who are the primary buyers of these vehicles are that you are sourcing from the dealers from the same coast, is an off-lease vehicle is pretty, typically where you sold to an independent dealer? So I guess my question is, are you finding that you are actually, I guess, one selling to like other dealers now that are transacting in their platform? And then two, are you running these like non-salvage vehicles on your existing auctions that would be the same ones that run the salvage vehicles or are you running like actual separate auctions for these vehicles? Will Franklin : Currently, we are running them on our existing auction platform under the Copart brand. And I would tell you that the buyers are primarily dealers and exporters. So, if you recall the comments I made earlier, our international buyers besides Mexico which you would expect as this proximity are the UAE, Nigeria and now Jordan, people buying these cars, taking them to those locations and then redistributing throughout the region in those areas. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it, okay. And then it sounds like online \u2013 this drive online platform that you have. Can you talk a little bit about this? I would think that\u2019s a whole car initiative that sounds maybe similar to other trade driver ACV does, but maybe just provide some context for that? Will Franklin : Sure. It\u2019s a new brand that we have got it to our portfolio. We have CrashedToys and NPA and Copart and it\u2019s a brand targeted at the whole car buyer providing them information and assurances that don\u2019t normally exist on the Copart auction. For example, we are providing condition report and in certain situation, we will provide a vehicle grade based on the Manheim metrics. We are just being with the very initial phases of rolling this out. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it, okay. And maybe unrelated or related, so I am trying to figure out, your purchase vehicle mix really spiked this quarter. Would you say this is all coming from international growth or could some of this be tied to some of your initiatives on the whole car side of the U.S.? Jeff Liaw : Per the other commentary, I think there is a lot of noise, because it\u2019s just not that substantial portion of our business overall. The international business is one factor. I don\u2019t think the non-insurance business per se affects this mix one way or the other. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. Okay. I am going to be a little greedy here. Just one quick question on the currencies, it\u2019s getting more important now. Can you just maybe give us a refresher on how do we think about the impacts of kind of a weakening dollar right now across your business like to what extent that like the sensitivity is for international buyers? And then two, is the UK business, does that \u2013 is that just translational accounting impacts or something else to tape out there? And I will hop off. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Sure. So in the near-term, we are generally speaking sure with the dollar. A stronger dollar makes our cars more expensive for international buyers. I am talking first about our U.S. auctions. So a weaker dollar enhances the purchasing power of international buyers and we would therefore see lists in our selling prices accordingly. So for the purposes of U.S. auctions, we are short at the dollar. When it comes to the UK earnings, as you note, there is first the effects of converting or translating. Those are our front words in GAAP territory, but nonetheless, the point is that our British pound earnings are worth more in U.S. dollars when the dollar is weaker and not when it\u2019s stronger. Then, of course, within the UK itself, there is that similar effect that the stronger the pound, the less that non-UK buyers can afford to pay for cars and the opposite is true as well, that the weaker the pound is relative to the currencies of the buyers for UK cars, the higher the selling prices would be for those cars in the UK. But if you had to put just a five-word explanation, you would conclude that we, generally speaking, favor a weaker U.S. dollar. Chris Bottiglieri : Impressive explanation. Thank you. Thanks for the help. Operator : And the final question comes from Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, thanks for the question. I guess I will not ask a non-salvage question here. My first one is just on just like UK clarification question and I am sorry if I missed this, but did you give what the UK profitability improved year-over-year, I know that\u2019s an initiative that you have been working on? So, just a clarification there would be great. Jeff Liaw : No, we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t really provide that metric. Stephanie Benjamin : Okay. And then just moving onto the U.S. service revenue per car and higher ASPs, obviously, the used car index and crushed body index we can all monitor, but I was wondering if you comment just on the increased bidding activity you are seeing, so what could possibly be driving this? Is this a function of a changing dynamic or we are lapping lower activity last year? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Sure. I\u2019d start first we are certainly lapping a soft quarter last year or a soft quarter even in terms of bidding activity. We think the increased bidding, number of bidders and bidding activity is a reflection in part of our own investments in marketing in member recruitment here in the U.S. and internationally. So we have invested meaningful resources in expanding that buyer base over time and that is of course reflected in the bidding activity as well. To a lesser extent perhaps, but also relevant is that currency matter we just talked about that the dollar is weaker again year-over-year relative to some relevant currencies and that has enhanced the buying power of non-U.S. buyers within our U.S. auctions. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : We have no further questions in queue. Jeff Liaw : Terrific. Well, thanks for joining us for the third quarter fiscal \u201818 earnings call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this conference and thank you for your participation. Have a great rest of your day.",

And welcome to the Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Just as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Sir, please go ahead. Jay Adair : Thank you, Katy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Q4 and year-end call for Copart. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, who will give you an update on finance and then Will Franklin, who will give you an update on the operations in the business, and then we will open it up for questions. With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, CFO. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. I'll start with the Safe Harbor. During today\u2019s call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings net of deferred tax changes, disposals of non-operating assets, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related fees and integration charges, reserves for legacy sales tax liabilities, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Web site under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued this morning. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. Now, turning our attention to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We achieved a record fourth quarter and unit sales revenue, gross profits and operating income. We're quite pleased by what we believe is strong underlying operational and financial performance, but it was of course a complex quarter given certain non-recurring, non-cash charges, which I'll elaborate on further during this call, as well as a slight mix shift to purchase cars and year-over-year changes in our tax rate. Starting with the topline, our revenue grew globally at 18.7% year-over-year with a modest contribution from beneficial year-over-year currency effects of approximately $1.5 million. We experienced global service revenue growth of 16.3%, which is largely the best reflection of underlying growth in the business. Purchase car growth of 37.7% driven by NPA Copart Direct Germany among others. Actual Copart owned inventory at the end of the quarter was $16.7 million, which as you know, is still small in the context of the overall business. As you know, if you have followed Copart for some time, viewing purchased car revenue on a nominal basis overstates its relative contribution to the business if we reflected only the net margin in our financials or if we were to gross up our service revenue generally for the average selling prices of cars, purchased car revenues would appear much smaller in comparison. We experienced global unit sales growth of 10.2% with U.S. unit growth of 9.8% and international growth of 12.2%. Will, will provide additional color on the growth drivers, but we did experience growth in both insurance and non-insurance volume. Our global inventory grew by 3.8%, slightly more than that excluding catastrophic inventory from both last year and this year. Our gross profit grew from $167.5 million to $188.4 million in the quarter, or 12.5% growth. That said, the fourth quarter of 2018 was burdened by a one-time non-recurring depreciation charge of $10.5 million due to assets newly placed into service as well as changes in the useful lives of fixed assets. The fourth quarter of \u201818 was also burdened by $1.9 million of write-downs of assets and certain separation costs in connection with our acquisition of the business in Finland. The gross margin rates decreased from last year, 44.2% to 41.9% or a decline of 230 basis points. That said, the non-recurring depreciation charge represents 230 basis points of that contraction by itself. Furthermore, the slight mix-shift to purchased cars represents another 70 basis points of thereabouts. The Finland write-down is an additional 40 basis points. The punch line being that in the quarter in which our gross margin rate declined year-over-year by 230 basis points, those factors alone represented 340 basis points or more than the total decline. We grew ASPs in the quarter year-over-year by 11.9% in the U.S. despite lapping a strong ASP growth quarter a year ago in fourth quarter of 2017 of 7% net. Will, will elaborate again, but this is continuing the phenomenon we talked about previously of newer cars being totaled less severely damaged cars being totaled, increased bidding activity, strong used car price environment, and a solid scrap price environment as well. Turning our attention to general and administrative expenditures, I\u2019ll start with the line item excluding stock compensation and depreciation. G&A ex those factors increased from $29.8 million a year ago to $42.8 million this year. Of that $13 million increase, $5.6 million is a non-recurring payroll expense in connection with certain executive stock comp exercises, which we have normalized in the non-GAAP EPS presentation you see in the press release, an additional $1.4 million of non-cash reserves in connection with certain sales tax liabilities. Those together are $7 million of $13 million increase in true one-time issues. Furthermore, approximately $2.9 million of our G&A growth is due to the acquisitions of NPA and the business in Finland. The balance then represents actual growth in general and administrative expenses for the quarter. As we have said routinely on our calls and interactions with our investors and others, our general and administrative expenditures will grow over time with inflation and with increases in complexity of our business, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the top line growth rate that we have experienced. Finally, two other points on G&A and other portions of the income statement; G&A depreciation increased by $1.6 million year-over-year, of which materially all is in connection with the acquisitions as described previously at NPA and AVK. Our GAAP operating income grew from $110.8 million to $134.8 million, or 21.7%. If you include the one-time matters that I described previously, the depreciation and amortization charge of $10.5 million, the $1.9 million write-down in connection with the Finnish acquisition, the sales tax liability, the payroll liability as well as an additional $1.1 million impairment of an intangible asset in connection with historical acquisition. Those factors together represented $20 million of decreased operating income in comparison to what it otherwise would have been. Our operating margin for the quarter was likewise depressed by 450 basis points attributable to those factors. Our net interest expense was down year-over-year from $5.5 million to $4 million, given the lower debt balance. I'll turn our attention to income taxes, in the fourth quarter as you know, there are additional complexities as tax reform comes into clearer focus with both a change to our recurring tax rate as well as one-time effects on deemed repatriation and deferred taxes and the like. Our Q4 effective rate of 17.3% benefited from certain non-recurring tax offsets, including the exercise of stock options, which again you see reflected in the adjusted EPS schedule. Our full year normalized rate for fiscal '18 would have been approximately 28%, excluding those one-time factors. That said, as you know, our U.S. federal cash tax rate for fiscal '19 will be 5.9% lower than what we experienced in fiscal '18 due to the full year benefit of tax reform. Because our fiscal year straddles the calendar year, we received a portion of the benefit in fiscal '18 with the full benefits in fiscal '19. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter increased from $70.3 million to $109.7 million, or 56% year-over-year increase. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income increased from $82.4 to $102.6 million, or growth of 24.5%. In the non-GAAP net income reconciliation schedule, you will see there the $2.9 million in deferred tax adjustments, the impairment of the long-lived assets, the targets we incurred in connection with the acquisition of our Finland business, as well as the legacy state tax liability. Not included in that reconciliation is the depreciation and amortization charge I've described a moment ago. The effective share count, the last comment before we get to EPS, has increased from $237.6 million a year ago to $244.4 million or 3% increase, with the majority of this increase attributable to our increase in share price due to the treasury method of accounting for stock options. Our non-GAAP EPS spend has increased from $0.35 to $0.42. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157.9 million and CapEx of $106.4 million in the quarter. It has a slight deviation from the past few quarters, 40% of these expenditures were for yard and transportation equipment. Tax reform created a one-time benefit for us of acquiring equipments and placing it into service in fiscal '18 of approximately an incremental 6% that we would not receive had we made those purchases in fiscal '19 and beyond, which caused us to accelerate the limited set of purchases into fiscal '18. The balance of our CapEx, as usual, was attributable largely to capacity expansions and big buy outs. And the last brief commentary I'll provide is on Germany before turning it to Will for additional explanation. As you know already, we've been running options at our two existing Copart Germany locations. In comparison to conventional remarketing methods in Germany, Copart Germany's options are already achieving substantially better returns at auction. As we penetrated German market, these superior returns will ultimately accrue to the benefits of German insurance carriers, policy holders, our buyer base and Copart itself. If you consider strategic drivers of our success in the markets in which we are more mature, we have world class capabilities in developing a robust buyer base, real estate for vehicle storage, physical logistics and transport and access to vehicles. On each of those four fronts, we have substantial initiatives underway that we'll discuss with you in greater detail on the next call. With that, I'll turn it over to Will Franklin. Will Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. First, let me provide some updates on hurricane Florence. As we have stated previously, our goal is to be in the constant state of readiness for these cats. That requires us to have permanent cat storage capacity. Relative to Florence, in the region, we have recently added a 90-acre facility near Raleigh and a 96-acre facility located in Spartanburg, South Carolina. In addition, we have available new facilities near Charleston, Winston-Salem, Atlanta and Fredericksburg, which are near completion, yet currently available to store cars. To supplement these new facilities and our 11 existing facilities in the cat region, days before the storm hit, we secured 17 temporary storage locations. We also mobilized almost 100 loaders, hundreds of tow trucks, our dedicated cat teams and we staged in the region our six mobile command centers. In total, we estimate that we have spent nearly $1.7 million in preparation for Florence, prior to the landing of the storm. Our response to hurricane Florence demonstrates our unmatched cat capabilities and our commitment and ability to execute during these events. In a cat, we don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting for the storm to clear and then assess our needs. We have to be on the ground days, even weeks beforehand, preparing for the worst outcome. Florence was a category four hurricane, the same as Harvey, while out in the Atlantic. It landed as one and quickly dissipated into a tropical storm. While it's too early in the claims cycle to know with certainty, we believe volumes generated in Florence will require only a limited use of our cat resources. Now, let me provide some commentary on our fourth quarter's operational results. In the U.S., our volume grew by 9.8% for the quarter and 12.9% for the year. When adjusted for cat activity, the year-over growth was 10.7%. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance markets, continued growth in the non-insurance markets and our NPA acquisition. Volume from noninsurance sellers, which includes franchise independent dealers, finance companies, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and wholesalers, grew by 27.6%. In total, non-insurance cars comprised 23.5% of total U.S. volumes compared to 20.2% for the same quarter last year. The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 26%, bank and financial institutions 23%, rental car companies 29%, wholesalers which almost doubled at 99% and industrial equipment, which more than doubled at 122%. In the U.S., our service revenue per car was up almost 6%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs, which grew by 11.9%. The increase in ASPs was driven by a number of factors; a 4.8% increase in the value of used cars as measured by Manheim index; an 18% increase in the value of crushed car bodies; the beneficial mix of crushed cars sold as non-insurance cars and power sport vehicles are generally run-in drive vehicles that yield a higher selling price; and the increase in our marketing activity. We are also seeing a behavioral change in the industry as insurance companies are totaling cars with less damage. We continue to expand our marketing activities and to enhance our auction platform. We have two objectives; first is to increase the number of bidders that participate in our online auction; and second is to increase the bidding activity of those who do. We are executing well on both. The number of unique bidders is up over 30% and the increase in number of bids received per lot is up almost 9%. Our marketing activity seeks to identify and encourage buyers wherever they are in the world to search our Web site to join our auctions. Despite the headwinds caused by the stronger dollar, buying activity from international buyers increased. Total sales to buyers with international business addresses, was 23.8%. When we include all the export activity, including buyers with domestic addresses who only export based on license our international markets represented 34.2% of U.S. units sold. Our international buyers and exporters also influence auctions by pushing bids higher by being the second high bidders. When we include this metric, our international buyers and exporters impact over 50% of all U.S. items sold. Additionally, our work on auction dynamics include continues as we improve the effectiveness on our online auction platform, which we believe to be the best in the world. Due to the electronic nature of our auction platform, we can capture all search and bidding activity, including individual product preferences and bidding tendencies. Utilizing that data, we may, when appropriate extend the auction for certain units in anticipation of further bidding activity, or employ other measures to elicit additional bids. We're also addressing the change in bidder behavior as they move towards mobile searching and bidding by improving our mobile experience. This quarter, 40% of all web traffic and 24% of winning bids were on mobile, up 80% and 20% respectively. In Canada, our volume grew by 29% for the quarter and 46% for the year due to market wins, as well as organic growth within the market as the Canadian salvage market, like the U.S. market, has seen growth in total loss frequency. In addition to the growth in volume, we've seen a meaningful growth in revenue per car as Canadian ASPs, like U.S. ASPs, have risen in Canada over 14%. To accommodate the increase in volume in Canada, last year, we expanded our yard in Calgary by 14-acres and we expect to announce 14-acre expansion of our Edmonton yard in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019. Turning to the UK, we delivered another strong quarter as EBIT and GBP. And after eliminating the impact of one-time payroll tax expense associated with an option exercise was up 10.8%. The growth was driven by an 8.1% increase in volume, and an increase in revenue per car also tied to higher ASPs. UK ASPs were also beneficially impacted by a change in mix as dealer car volume grew by 18.7%, and represented 10.2% of total volume compared to 9.2% in the same quarter last year. We are also seeing meaningful progress in Brazil where volume was up almost 9% quarter-over and 10% year-over. This growth was achieved in a very challenging market. Brazilian new car sales in 2017 were down 40% from 2013. The car park is aging and auto policy count has been declining. Nevertheless, we have grown volume by gaining market share due we believe to our ability to deliver exceptional operational and marketing results. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our revenues and EBITDA grew by almost 11% and 30% respectively, after adjusting for a beneficial one-time adjustment. We believe Copart Brazil will become an increasingly more meaningful contributor to our overall financial performance. We're seeing rising diesel fuel, labor and health insurance product costs across the board. Nevertheless, on a consolidated basis and excluding the costs associated with the exit of dismantling activity in Finland, our average cost to process each car grew only marginally over the same quarter last year, as we leverage our fixed cost model. Our inventory was up in North America, the UK and worldwide by 3%, 5.5% and 3.8% respectively. This quarter, North America sales grew by 10.2%. Over the last 16 quarters, our year-over-year quarterly volume growth has averaged 11.3%. We have previously discussed extensively the drivers for the growth in the North America total loss market. While the growth rate and accident frequency is moderating, we see no such trends in total loss frequency. We expect to see continued growth in both car park and total loss frequency. Accordingly, we remain extremely active in our yard expansion program to accommodate the growth produced by both market wins and organic growth and the insurance market, our continued expansion in non-insurance markets and our need for additional cat capacity. We did not announce the opening of any new yards this quarter. However, in addition to the yards in Leipzig, Germany, Spartanburg, South Carolina, Chiba, Brazil and our new NPA site in Madison, Wisconsin, which we have all opened after the close of the last quarter, we currently have 28 other land development projects currently under construction, representing over 1,500-acres of new capacity, 26 of those in the U.S., one each in Canada and Germany. That concludes my remarks. Katy, now we'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A. Operator : Thank you sir [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : I wanted to just take a step back on G&A. You gave us a lot of detail there, and I'll certainly go back through the transcript and stuff. But just I know you won't guide to numbers specifically. Could you talk a little bit about the profile as a percent of sales? Has anything materially changed? Whereas you know there'd be negative operating leverage going forward. Do you still expect to get operating leverage on that line? And how should we think about G&A going forward given the significant volatility over the last few quarters? Jeff Liaw : In short, yes. We do expect to achieve, as we have very consistently in history, our operating leverage on G&A. This quarter, as you know, we -- on the non-stock comp, non-G&A line item, the $13 million increase included $7 million itself just on the payroll taxes and the legacy sales tax liabilities. So those are true non-occurring, not in the baseline so to speak. Then there was about $3 million that we picked up from the acquisitions of our businesses in Finland and in NPA. And the balance is the actual growth in G&A for the quarter. So yes, we do expect to achieve leverage, so there will be some inflation as we add complexity in the business as we expand into Germany and the rest of Western Europe initiators of that sort. There can be modest increases, but still on balance, we will achieve better growth in operating income than we do in gross profit and revenue. Bob Labick : And then, I think Will touched on this in the end and on last call. You have something like 11% or close CAGR in volume over the last four years in the U.S. car volume. Have you kept up with that in land? I know you've reported lots of land acquisitions, but you haven't given us a sense of how much you picked up. And so, I guess the question is have you kept up with the volume with land, and if not, what have you done to maintain the efficiencies in the yards as utilization rate seemingly creeps up? Will Franklin : We have kept up, Bob. I can't say this, though that whatever excess capacity we had three years ago is dissipated. But our procurement, our acquisition, and our development activity is one of our primary focuses here as across the world. We employ, I think, a very aggressive and when I say aggressive, I mean high assumption in terms of growth rate when we plan our expansion and our capacity needs. So, I think we're developing to that number. So, when you look at those elevated growth rates, we're anticipating an additional permanent CAT capacity that we're pursuing, it's a big job. But to answer your question, we think we've got it covered. I'd like to say we've got 28 projects in construction. I think you'll see a number of those being announced in the next two quarters, and if you are looking at the targets that we're pursuing and I would say contracts that we have entered into, there\u2019s about another 45 of those. So, I think we're well situated to accommodate the growth in the market as well as any CAT needs. Bob Labick : And last one from me, just on Germany. Can you give us some updates in terms of the number of either insurance companies or rental car companies that are participating in those auctions, and other milestones we should look for there as you build that? I think you mentioned there's another yard to come there as well. Jay Adair : We've changed some of our approach and strategy in the German market, and we're going to give you an update on that in the next quarter. So where we've got two locations today, we're going to be opening a significant number of locations in this quarter. I don\u2019t like to talk about what we're going to do. I would like to talk about what we've done. So in the next Q, we'll be reporting on how many new locations we've opened, and we're clearly looking at the market as we\u2019ve got to have the logistics and facilities in place to service the insurance industry. With that said, we are handling some insurance volume in that market, but primarily the majority of the volume that we're handling right now is noninsurance, and that allows us to build their salvage vehicles. They\u2019re just not procured directly from the insurance. They\u2019re procured directly from owners of vehicles. These are owner retentions where the insurance company has had the insured retain the vehicle and we\u2019ve reached out to the insurers and acquired the vehicle from them to flip it through auction. And in that environment, what we're doing is, we\u2019re creating a marketplace where today we\u2019re the largest auction house in the country that you can come. I\u2019ll give you a great example, today we had 150 cars on auction in Hanover. All those vehicles, if you bid, you own them. And that is the only auction environment I know of in Germany where you have 100% chance to getting the car if you bid on it. Everything else is, in the country, is contingent auction environment where you may not end up getting the vehicle, so we\u2019re selling -- you can go online, I can tell you we\u2019re selling over 400 cars a month right now, but you can go online, look at the auctions, I\u2019d encourage everyone to do that. And then let's wait until next quarter when we report on a much bigger update on our strategy and our approach in that market. But I'll finish by saying it\u2019s taking up a significant amount of my time now. I'm spending a fair amount of my own time on Germany, and we are very committed to the market and succeeding before the end of the calendar year in terms of large locations and large volume. Jeff Liaw : And Bob, just to elaborate briefly on that point. So the sourcing car is from some policyholders directly, bars the function of the way the German insurance markets and its indemnification provisions have evolved over the years. However, then sales to Copart Germany that\u2019s what lead me to the statement that we clearly are achieving better returns. So our conviction that the Copart\u2019s model is the right one for the German insurance market long-term remains as true as ever, and the evolution Jay described is merely how we achieve that outcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Stephanie Benjamin : I just wanted to go back and follow-up on the G&A, or I am sorry, overall operating income and the one-time expenses. And happy to do this offline if that\u2019s easier. But I think you mentioned that there\u2019s about $20 million in non-recurring in the quarter. Of that, what was broken out in the non-GAAP adjustment schedule in the press release? I just want to make sure I'm getting it correct based on that. Jeff Liaw : In the non-GAAP schedule, you have everything but the $10.5 million of depreciation and amortization that burdened gross profit for the quarter. Otherwise, in the non-GAAP reconciliation, you see on a post tax basis, the pretax numbers that I just walked through. Stephanie Benjamin : So really -- and you said the operating income had $20 million of one time that we would not expect to occur, going forward\u2026 Jeff Liaw : Correct. Stephanie Benjamin : My next question is actually is just on Brazil. I think that very positive there, and almost seems like -- and I think the comment that it\u2019s going to be a more meaningful contributor. Is there something that has materially changed just in the last couple of months in that market, either on your end or from just the market standpoint to cause this to be a larger contributor? Or just more color there would be really helpful? Thanks. Will Franklin : There\u2019s a change, it just wasn\u2019t recent. It\u2019s take -- we entered the market in, I think 2012 and it takes a while to build out not only your team but your processes, and to gain the kind of reputation that you need to grow the business, kind of reputation, the kind of brand that we have here in the United States. And in Brazil, we're starting to gain that brand recognition, especially with the insurance companies. And you saw that we have expanded north in Betim. Recently, we added a new yard south in Curitiba. And we think there's opportunity to grow, simply because we operate better than everyone we think and we provide the highest returns through our re-marketing efforts. And we just think it's the byproduct of that will be growth in our volume and our presence in the market. Stephanie Benjamin : And will you be able to provide the percent, or the percent contribution Brazil had in the quarter? Or by top -- or should I wait until the 10-K? Or how should we go around that? Will Franklin : We haven't sized in that respect and we probably won't until it becomes a material number with respect to the total. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Jeff, I think you mentioned a small issue but a change in lives of the fixed assets and some change in assumption there. Can you shed more light on that decision? Jeff Liaw : Yes. So in short, I was commenting in total on the $10.5 million non-recurring depreciation charge that burdened yard expenses and shows up in gross profit. And the two drivers there are, one, assets newly placed in service with a substantial depreciation charge associated with that, as well as change in certain useful lives, and this is based on a change in management estimates. We have a number of facilities with different useful lives and we harmonize them, so to speak, and adjusted them accordingly. So that charge is not one you would see on an ongoing basis for the quarter. Craig Kennison : And I guess I'm just trying to understand what drove that decision to change the length of the lives. Jeff Liaw : I think as you know in the past few years alone, we have significantly increased our own experience in acquiring land and developing it, including with our own in-house team in Bright Excavation. So I think our -- the information we have available to us, our understanding even of our land has improved significantly even over the past two years. So when reviewing historical fixed asset ledgers, we bring that heightened awareness to bear and that caused us to revise certain of those numbers accordingly. Craig Kennison : And then as we think about Germany and maybe the acceleration in activity there through the end of the year. Should we anticipate costs running ahead of revenues for a period of time here? Jeff Liaw : Craig, I think from the perspective of the overall P&L, I think the effect would not be that pronounced of what you just described. So there certainly will be moments when we invest when we have costs that are ahead of the contribution. There'll be moments when the opposite is true when we see the flow through the contribution in connection with costs that we've previously invested. I don't think that on balance you would see -- from your perspective, a meaningful drag on the P&L. Craig Kennison : And then with respect to CapEx. Could you just lay out your plan for CapEx spending in fiscal '19, and maybe give us some of the bigger buckets where you expect to allocate capital? Jeff Liaw : CapEx in fiscal '19 will continue to be dominated by capacity expansions. So it will be land developments and acquisitions. In some cases the weak buyout. So I think the rough number over the past say eight quarters would be 85% or so of our CapEx has been for those. And as for capacity, in general, you know that our capital expenditures have been up over the past few years. We largely expect that to continue into fiscal '19. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : I wanted to ask about revenue per unit. It's been really strong for some time here. Obviously, ASP growth has contributed to that. But you guys have also talked about some of the things that you've been doing around being dynamic in the auctions. So I'd be curious to, to the extent that you can, delineate between how much of the ARPU increase is from external factors, a reflection of the market? And how much of that is because of decisions you guys are making? Jeff Liaw : Ben, I would like to be fair, those variables would be really hard to isolate, because they both happen concurrently with literally every auction we run. So we can't isolate either the market effects or what we do as opposed to what we do we can to some extent. But what I would tell you is that both have been meaningful that as we've look at the market for used car prices, they are very strong but they're certainly not up 12% year-over-year either. So there is some function of the marketplace being strong, but also some meaningful function of our innovations, our member recruitments, our auction management. Ben Bienvenu : And then my second question is just around a follow up on capital allocation. Cash continues to build on the balance sheet. And I know you don\u2019t make a practice of talking about your future plans for buyback. But I'd just be curious we haven't heard an update around the M&A landscape in sometime. I'd be just curious to hear little bit more about how you think M&A fits in your future prioritization of use of cash flow? Jeff Liaw : It\u2019s a fair question, Ben. M&A certainly has been a part of Copart's journey over the past few decades. It has driven growth in the business. And in some cases, I think that will continue to be true, going forward. That said, I think as you know in our core markets in which we are strongest, the U.S. and UK and so forth, there are more limited opportunities to acquire company. Beyond that, we do revisit this topic from time-to-time we always have as our hurdle that; one, we have to like the acquisition in isolation that it has to make financial sense as to generate the kinds of returns on capital that Copart is going to expect; and secondly, that it has to dovetail well with our strategic initiatives broadly, whether that\u2019s international expansion in Brazil, Europe and the likes, or expanses into additional future spaces. So that rubric that calculus hasn\u2019t changed at all. We won't largely comment on this kind of activity until after the fact, as you know, for all these reasons. But M&A will be a part of Copart's future as well. Ben Bienvenu : And just a quick follow-on to that. A lot of the acquisitions you guys have made historically have been either geographically or capacity focused. When we think about building out future capabilities, are those all elements of your business that you can build organically? Or are you looking at targets from time-to-time that potentially bring capabilities to bear fruit for Copart as well? Jeff Liaw : The latter. So 2Q illustrations, National Powersport Auctions, an acquisition we completed in June of last year clearly an extension into the non-salvage power sports arena. So the addition or capabilities via acquisitions that was not organic per se. And even in Germany, our first foray into Germany was in connection with the acquisition of WOM, which is one of the listing services you heard us describe on prior conference calls as well. So from time-to-time, we will extend beyond what I would characterize as Copart\u2019s traditional salvage auction business in our M&A activity. But for the reasons we just described, those of course have higher hurdles still if it deviates from what we know and have done day-to-day forever, we have to be that much more sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : As we maybe accelerate the business in Germany, I think in the early comments, you discussed your purchased vehicle volumes were up partially as a result of Germany. Do we think the purchase mix is going to accelerate from here, and I guess as we think about the gross margin impact going forward? Jeff Liaw : And Bret I think to be -- I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think to be fair, we don\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t manage the business that way. I understand that as the purchased car volumes were to increase that would depress our nominal margin rate, but that's a particularly sophisticated way to run the business where we want to maximize contribution and profit. And so we wouldn\u2019t think in those terms except when we end up on quarterly calls like this one\u2026 Bret Jordan : Well, I was just wondering whether we should think about that going forward as you try to project your nominal margin rate. Is Germany\u2019s acceleration going to be meaningful from here? Jeff Liaw : On Germany specifically, let me comment more generally. On Germany specifically, I think you heard Jay and I both say, we\u2019ll have a whole lot more to say on the next call than on this one. But more generally, when Copart has grown into new spaces, we have often expanded, first, through the purchased car model until we have achieved liquidity and proven it in the various counterparties in the market, we\u2019re often better off buying the cars ourselves, selling them at auctions, generating a profit and improving to all the market participants that we do so. Overtime, that very naturally evolves the consignment model as was true, for example, in the UK, most notably. Or you may remember from back in the day, we were heavily tilted to the purchase model when compared to the consignment. The opposite is true today as we\u2019ve achieved that liquidity. So when we are growing in new spaces, NPA is another example. NPA has a five -- historically had a five store footprint, so to speak, in the United States. They had tremendous credibility among dealers in and around those locations. As they expand beyond those geographies, initially will they buy a few more bikes to prove their model? Yes. And the same will be true in Germany and could be true in other international markets as well. So it will have an effect. But as per that two lengthy paragraphs about purchased cars, I wouldn\u2019t overweight that in the overall analysis. But yes, I think purchased cars could or will outgrow consignment sales for the near future. Bret Jordan : And then a follow-up question. So Will\u2019s commentary around Florence, sounds like an incremental $1.7 million spent to prep and I think volumes may be light coming out of that storm. Is that about the magnitude of the loss? Was there -- or the impact of the cap that may come from Florence? Or are they incremental expenses that have -- that will come along the way? And I guess there will be some volume to offset that expense. So it\u2019d be maybe less than that $1.7 million. Will Franklin : It\u2019s really too early to tell. When all the water subsides and the claims start coming in, the assignments come in then we\u2019ll have a better picture of that. The $1.7 million that I quoted was just what we spent to prepare for the storm. So there\u2019ll be other expenses to follow-on throughout the course of next weeks and months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : You said your U.S. inventory was up 3% year-over-year. Were you comping against the impact of catastrophic events last year? Jeff Liaw : Not largely, Hurricane Harvey hit it August of last year. So July 31, '17 had some catastrophic events, hailstorms and the likes, but not the meaty ones you might have in mind. Gary Prestopino : So it's more of a seasonal impact and it just ebbs and flows, but this is a seasonally slow time for accidents. Is that more a way we should read that? Jeff Liaw : The seasonality, I don't think would factor into a year-over-year number, but I think this even should be set the same year-over-year. Gary Prestopino : And then your tax rate you said was I think somewhere around 28% for the year. And then you said something about a 5.3% decrease for next year. Is that 5% decrease off of that 28%? Jeff Liaw : Yes, fair question. And I would perhaps let me clear it. The fiscal '18 normalized tax rate includes big lumpy stuff, like the stock option exercises, would have been approximately 28% blended for the company. 28% includes the 26.9% U.S. federal and that includes state income tax through some foreign taxes and the like. The point about fiscal '19 is that for the U.S. portion of our income, which historically is in the 80% to 85% range of the total income for the company that on that specifically our U.S. federal rate will decline from 26.9% in fiscal '18 to 21% in fiscal '19. So that will in and of itself somewhat meaningfully lower our tax rate in fiscal '19. Gary Prestopino : And then could you just -- I was trying to write this down. Could you just give me your unit growth in the U.S. and international, and then on a combined basis in the quarter? Jeff Liaw : 9.8% U.S. 12.2% international, global 10.2%. Gary Prestopino : And then lastly on your ASPs, you said the U.S. we're up about 11.9%. I couldn't write this down again. How much of that change was due to scrap? Jeff Liaw : It's tough to quantify. We can tell you how much scrap was up. The scrap year-over-year, it remains a pretty healthy environment, was up 18%. I think sometimes the perception is a little overwhelmed on the importance of scrap in our business. So if you consider the typical car that Copart sells, a passenger sedan has a ton and half of total content, the crushed car body just the usual number is just $200 per ton. So it's $300 of scrap content in a car for a car that sells for thousands. But even if the scrap is up 18%, you're talking about $40 or $50 change to the underlying value of a car that sells for thousands of dollars. So the expected matters in particular on our lowest end vehicles, I suspect it had virtually no effect on the cars that will be rebuilt and brought back on to the road. In some theoretical form, you could imagine that 10 years from now when that car is done that scrap value [indiscernible] back. But I think the scrap matters, it\u2019s a contributor, but I don't think it's nearly -- it's not that meaningful a portion of that ASP. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : I wanted the thought on the dealer first kind of descriptive details, I am not sure I got them all. But I think you were up 90% last quarter year-over-year, and maybe I'm misinterpreting that metric. But can you give the comparable metric, what it was this quarter? And collectively you've given these different sub-segments, the rental cars and whatnot. If you're aggregate what you're doing in the whole car space and how that's growing, maybe just provide some context to what that also had done last quarter? Will Franklin : I'm not sure the numerical questions that you had. I can talk about the segments in general. I mean, we're finding that -- we're tracking more and more buyers for these types of cars, which allows us to just the chicken egg, provide higher returns, which allows us to approach those who have these types of cars and ask them to test our re-marketing and our auction platform. And through that process, they found it to be fruitful in terms of increasing their returns, and in turn has grown that market. We've also developed specific programs for different buyers. So we have a different program for equipment sellers, or we have a different program for wholesalers, or we may have a separate program for financial companies. And so we're becoming more astute in identifying their specific needs and addressing those through our processes and our technology. Chris Bottiglieri : Let me rephrase it differently. Did your growth in dealer cars accelerate or decelerate, and what you've done last quarter it makes the simple question? Will Franklin : I think it accelerated. Chris Bottiglieri : Accelerated, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just like holistically as you think about the strategy, given that you're growing pretty aggressively. But I would think your capabilities and service are lower and than -- your platform effect is a little bit lower right now. Can you talk about how your product is differentiated relative to the incumbents and what's driving that growth? And how we think about sustainability of how much longer you can compound this growth and dealer consignment? Will Franklin : We think there is a long runway ahead of us in terms of growth and dealer consignment. I think we're in the first or second inning of this game. And I think we're refining our processes. We're adding more resources to the pursuit of this volume. And we think that the sellers who are trying and utilizing our platform are very happy with the results. So I think there's a robust opportunity ahead of us with respect to dealer cars. Operator : Thank you, sir. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I'd now like to turn it back over for closing remarks. Jay Adair : Well, thanks Katy. Thank you everyone for attending the call. And we look forward to reporting on Q1 in November. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Chantelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter conference call for Copart fiscal 2019. It's my pleasure this morning to turn it over to Jeff, who will go through the financials. We'll then come back to Will, who will give you an update on U.S. and international. And then, I will give you an update on what is happening in Germany, since there are a lot of changes going on there, and pass back to Jeff as well. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Jay. I'll start today's call with a safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of disposals of nonoperating assets, foreign-currency-related gains and losses and certain income tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP bases described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. Turning our attention first to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We achieved a record first quarter in unit sales revenue, gross profit and operating income. The period presents a somewhat noisy comparison in comparison to the first quarter of last year given the events of Hurricane Harvey last year and Florence and Michael this year. We'll provide metrics during this call with and without those events to provide you a cleaner comparison. Starting at the top line. Our global revenue grew 10.1% year-over-year. Excluding those three hurricanes I just mentioned, revenue would have been 15.1% instead. We were burdened by an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect on revenue of 0.3 million on foreign operations primarily due to the strength - relative strength of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the pound and the Brazilian real. Our global service revenue grew 5.5%. Again, excluding those three hurricanes, global service revenue would have grown at 11% instead. Purchased car growth was 48%, split approximately equally between U.S. and internationally in terms of the absolute growth. The growth in the U.S. was driven by a mix of things, including NPA and Copart Direct. Internationally, our growth was driven by the U.K. and also by Germany. As you know from following Copart, our actual Copart owned inventory is still relatively modest, with $19.7 million at quarter end, small in the context of our overall business since purchased car revenue reflects the gross value while our service revenue reflects only the net. Our global unit sales grew 4.1% year-over-year, with U.S. unit growth of 2.4% and international unit growth of 14.3%. Excluding those three hurricanes, our global unit sales growth would have been 5.6%, with U.S. growth of 4.2% and the international growth, of course, unchanged. Our nominal global inventory decreased year-over-year 1.5%, but excluding those three hurricanes, our global inventory was up 10% year-over-year in comparing the October ending balance versus the October ending balance of a year ago. Turning to our gross profit. Gross profit grew from $163.3 million a year ago to $195.9 million this year or 20% growth. As you may recall, the first quarter '18 was burdened by Hurricane Harvey, which represented a net drag on the quarter of $17.2 million at the gross profit line. The first quarter of '19 is likewise burdened by expenses related to Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which collectively represented $4 million of gross profit loss in the quarter. We have not treated this event as an \"extraordinary event\". We believe the storm readiness and responses in essential service that we provide for our customers, and although catastrophic events tend to be unprofitable for Copart, and in the case of major storms [indiscernible] substantially. So we believe our commitment to exceptional service in these events distinguishes Copart from the competition. Excluding these three events, our gross profit in both periods would have yielded a gross profit growth of 11%, a meaningful leverage on our unit growth of 5.6%. Our gross margin rate increased from 39% to 42.5% for an increase of 350 basis points. That, of course, includes the burden of Hurricane Harvey a year ago as well as Florence and Michael this year. Excluding all three of those events, gross margin rate would have declined slightly approximately 180 basis points, with a strong majority of that decline attributable to the mix shift in purchased cars. On ASPs, I'll provide just a quick headline with Will to provide much more color thereafter. Our ASPs grew 13.1% in the U.S. despite lapping a strong ASP growth quarter a year ago in the first quarter of '18 of also 13% or thereabouts. Turning to our general and administrative expenses. Stock compensation and depreciation grew from $29.5 million a year ago to $34.8 million. U.S. growth in this respect of $3.8 million largely related to costs associated with supporting our growth initiatives, as well as certain litigation costs, and the $1.5 million increase internationally is largely related to the expansion of our European business. As we have repeatedly said, our general and administrative expenses will grow over time with inflation and complexity, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage over time given the strong top line growth. Our GAAP operating income grew from $123.9 million to $151.4 million or growth of 22%. Excluding the hurricanes, operating income would have grown at approximately 10% year-over-year. Our net interest expense was down due to a lower net debt balance. Our first quarter income tax rate of 23.3% is a reflection of the lower U.S. federal tax rate you heard us talk about on prior calls. We are now at a 21% U.S. federal tax rate for the full fiscal year '19. Our GAAP net income increased from $77.5 million a year ago to $114.1 million this year or growth of 47% year-over-year. As I'm sure you recall, we experienced a somewhat complex quarter in the fourth quarter. The first quarter is relatively straightforward in comparison with very limited non-GAAP adjustments to net income. And therefore, the net income of $77.1 million a year ago in comparison to $113.6 million this year is similar with growth of 47% year-over-year. One last topic, turning our attention to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. I'll pause here to talk about revenue recognition 606 or the rev 606 new accounting standard. This is the first quarter in which we've implemented those new revenue recognition principles, which reflects largely a reversion to how Copart previously accounted for its revenue prior to the implementation of rev 605 in fiscal 2011. So under the new accounting standard, to oversimplify, we will largely recognize revenue in connection with a particular vehicle at the time of its auction, including, for example, services we provide with respect to inbound towing and title processing. The onetime cumulative adjustment to retained earnings is a reduction of $23 million. Certain revenue and corresponding costs that had been recognized in Q4 and previously under the prior accounting standards are now recognized in Q1 and beyond, while revenue and corresponding costs that previously would have been recognized in Q1 are instead deferred to Q2 and beyond. The long and short of it is the net effect on our P&L in Q1 was not material in terms of either revenue or our profit metrics. The new revenue recognition standards also affect our balance sheet in non-cash ways. For example, because we will not recognize revenue as earned until the time of auction as a general matter, certain of our accounts receivables that we would previously have booked in Q1 will now instead be booked in Q2. So on our balance sheet, you'll see the AR balance would nominally reflect a decrease of $16 million, but the change in cash from the cash flow statement on accounts receivable of $29.3 million is a more accurate reflection of like-for-like AR growth year-over-year. The same logic applies to vehicle pooling costs. We will now defer more of our costs into Q2 and have \"deferred\" costs from Q4 that we've now recognized in Q1 in subsequent periods. As a result, VPC growth on our balance sheet of $39 million significantly outpaces like-for-like VPC growth of $13.6 million as reflected in our cash flow statement. On cash flow itself, we generated operating cash flow for the quarter of $107.7 million, with CapEx of $62 million at change. A little over half call it 55% of our CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts, with the balance attributable to yard equipment, IT and others. And with that, I'll turn it over to Will for more color on the business. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. And I'll provide a few comments about our operational performance for the quarter, where we once again delivered a very strong quarter. In the U.S., our volume grew by 4.3% when adjusted for all CAT activity, which includes Hurricane Harvey last year and Hurricanes Florence and Michael this year. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance market and a continued expansion into the noninsurance markets. Organic growth in the salvage market continues to be driven by, we believe, an increase in total loss frequency as high repair costs are leading to a higher percentage of accidents resulting in an economic total loss. We continue to aggressively develop our noninsurance business, which include franchise and independent dealers, finance companies and leasing companies, fleets, charities, municipalities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 29%, finance companies, 11%, wholesalers, 54%, rental car companies, 30%; and fleet and industrial equipment, up 77%. The only segments in which we experienced declines were charities and municipalities as we intentionally restricted our sales and marketing activities in these low profit segments. We have successfully grown our noninsurance volume as we developed better systems integration and [de-fleet] [ph] bank and dealership operating systems, developed a more focused internal programs targeting the specific operational needs of individual segments and as we continue to increase the returns that we're delivering to our noninsurance sellers. In total, our U.S. noninsurance volume grew by 14% and 44% over the same quarter last year and same quarter two years ago. However, excluding charities and municipalities, our noninsurance volume grew by 30% and 116% for the same quarters. In total, noninsurance business represented approximately 25% of our total U.S. volume. In the U.S., our service revenue per car, excluding the impact of Harvey, on a quarter basis was up almost 6%. The increase in revenue per car was due primarily to higher ASPs, which grew by 12.7% as more than half of our total revenue per car is tied to the ultimate selling price of vehicle. The increase in ASPs were driven by a number of factors, a 4.5% increase in the value of used cars as measured by the Manheim Index, which, in October, reached the 140-mark for your first time, a 15.2% increase in the value of crushed car bodies; beneficial mix of cars sold as noninsurance cars and powersports vehicles are generally running dry [ph] and near the higher selling price, the increase of our digital marketing activity, and the continuing trend of insurance companies totaling newer, more valuable and less severely damaged vehicles. We continue to expand our marketing activities and to enhance our auction platform. On a quarter over basis, the number of unique bidders was up almost 25% and the increase in the number of bids received per lot was up almost 6%. Our outreach to international buyers continues. Our U.S. website is now translated into 7 languages. These languages are native to 135 countries. We now sell cars from our U.S. yards to 147 countries. Despite the headwinds caused by the stronger dollar, buying activity from international buyers on a quarter over basis increased. Total sales to international buyers was over 23%. When we include all export activity, including buyers with domestic addresses who only export, our international market represents over 34% of all units sold. We believe these activities contributed to the record U.S. ASPs and auction return percentages. Now turning to our international operations. Our revenue grew from $68 million to $90.2 million or 32.5%. International service revenues grew from $42.7 million to $51.2 million or 19.9% while purchased car revenue grew from $25.3 million to $38.9 million or 53.9%. EBIT grew from $17.9 million to $21.1 million or 18% as purchased car revenue inherently yields a lower margin per vehicle. Volume grew by 14.3%, driven primarily by growth in the U.K., Germany and Brazil. Jeff and Jay will provide far more detailed comments on our progress in Germany later in the call. Globally, we are seeing rising diesel fuel prices, labor and health insurance costs. Nevertheless, when adjusting for the abnormal costs associated with Hurricane Harvey last year and Hurricanes Florence and Michael this year, our average cost to process each car grew by only 2.7% in the U.S. and 3.5% worldwide over the same quarter last year. In total, the incremental costs this quarter associated with Hurricanes Florence and Michael was approximately $4.3 million. To provide the CAT support our insurance customers come to expect, we must make financial commitments early in the CAT process. Accordingly, before the storm hits, we obtain and we stage equipment and people. We obtain additional land capacity and we arrange for additional sub-haul capacity. We do this on a scale appropriate for the worst possible scenario. For Hurricanes Florence and Michael, we relocated 180 people, 75 loaders. We arranged for an additional 500 trucks for sub-haul capacity, and we committed to 17 new temporary property leases. We'd like to acknowledge the outstanding work of our CAT teams and reinforce Copart's continued commitment to supporting our insurance customers during all CAT activity. Our CAT-adjusted inventory was up in the U.S., internationally and worldwide by 10.4%, 14.1% and 10.9%, respectively. The growth in U.S. inventories suggests a continuation of our double-digit quarterly volume growth expectations. Accordingly, we remain extremely active in our yard expansion program to accommodate the growth and in support of our effort to provide permanent CAT capacity at CAT regions. During the last quarter, we entered into 21 land purchase and lease contracts. We closed on 11 contracts. In North America, we are currently engaged at 26 land development projects, representing over 1,200 acres of capacity. That concludes my brief comments. Now I will turn the call back over to our CEO, Jay Adair, for further comments. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Will. Good morning again, everyone. Before we discuss Germany, I'd like to give you an overview of the U.K. We knew 15 years ago that we need to be a global business to win. We entered the U.K. in June of 2007 with an acquisition of a small company that had 3 locations called Century Salvage. Shortly after that, we purchased Universal Salvage, giving us 9 locations across the U.K. Today, we have 15 locations that allow us to pick up quickly and economically across the U.K. To win, we knew we needed a network of locations. We grew the business organically by winning new business, by opening additional yards and through some future acquisitions. For those of you that have followed us over the years, you know that we used to have this principle on the vast majority of the insurance cars that we sold in the U.K. At the beginning, we didn't have the track record in the U.K. that we obviously had in the U.S., so we were happy to buy cars and make money in the process. Over time, we simply showed to carriers favorable spreads that we were generating on our trades. And in doing that, they shifted to a consignment model instead of selling their vehicles to us. We do this because it is better to be on the side of our customers as a partner rather than as a vendor purchasing vehicles. Now Copart U.K. is the #1 place to go buy a salvaged vehicle in the U.K., selling well over 300,000 units a year and generating the highest returns in the market. To deliver on the Copart promise, in Germany, we need a network of yards, a marketplace, people and the technology to deliver on that promise. And I'm happy to say that we're there today in Germany. Because Will is focused on running the U.S., Jeff has been able to spend a lot of time working on Germany to get us to this point. So I'd like to turn it over to Jeff now to give you an update on the German operations, and I'd like to thank all of those that were involved in the last 6 months in Germany on making the success that we've seen happen for Copart. Jeff? Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Jay. On the topic of Germany, you've heard piecemeal from us, of course, over the years. And as promised on the first quarter call, we want to take this opportunity to describe the opportunity and our status in greater detail. I'll start first with a description of the German industry more broadly. The German insurance market, auto insurance market, operates very differently from the U.K. and the U.S. with respect to total loss claims. In the U.S., for example, when you as a covered policyholder total your car, the insurance company effectively buys the car from you, and what happens thereafter is invisible. As you know, the insurance company then consigns the car through Copart and keeps the proceeds of the auction. In Germany, by contrast, nearly every car in an accident, even a mangled one, is owner retained. So when an accident occurs, the insurance company estimates how much value the policyholder has lost by comparing the pre-accident value, or PAV, of the car with the post-accident residual value of the vehicle and pays the policyholder that loss of value. As the insurance company assess that post-accident value, the carrier registers the car on multiple listing services, in effect, miniature auctions on which buyers bid for vehicles. The insurance company generally then chooses the highest bid from across all of these listing services to be the \"residual value\" from which the indemnity payment is calculated and then paid to the policyholder. The policyholder then has a 21-day option period to sell the vehicle to the listing service auction \"winner\" at the residual value just established. But there's a catch : these listing services are a really tough experience for the buyers themselves. First, buyers are obligated to honor their bids for a full 21 days after bidding, tying up their capital. Second, the buyers have the obligation to buy the car, but the owner of the vehicle does not have an obligation to sell it to them, creating a fairly severe adverse selection problem. And thirdly, perhaps most importantly, they will ultimately close on fewer than 1 in 10 vehicles on which they are the \"winning bidder\" on a listing service. That makes it impossible to plan for the -- to plan their own dismantling and rebuilding business, and of course, further complicates tying up capital on cars you largely won't win. So the punchline is that buyers are constrained by their capital on how many vehicles they can bid on and, given adverse selection, will bid depressed values for cars. So who ultimately loses in this inefficient process? Insurance carriers are establishing their indemnity payments or their financial losses on claims based on what is an artificially depressed residual value. The cost is paid by them and ultimately by German policyholders, who have to cover excess lost costs with their premiums. We'll then turn our attention to Copart Germany's evolution. In 2012, recognizing that we needed to understand the market firsthand, we acquired Wreck Online Marketplace, one of the leading listing services in Germany. Then in 2016, we opened our first auction location in Germany in Bad Fallingbostel near Hanover. In our last earnings call, we talked about evolving our strategy in Germany as well. That evolution in short is as follows : we intend to pursue insurance company consignments in parallel with our efforts to purchased cars on our listing service. In the past, when we've entered new markets, as Jay just described, in the U.K., for example, in 2007; and in mature [ph] business in the U.S., we have sometimes established our presence by buying cars first. We intend to move very quickly to build the infrastructure that advantages Copart in a more mature market. That includes the land that enables us to store cars efficiently -- I'll talk more about land in a moment; trucks in a geographic footprint enables us to tow cars economically; and vehicle auction volume that attracts buyers and sellers alike. In 2018, so far, we have announced our next 6 locations. That physical footprint is critical because it enables fast pickup across the entire country and essential capability in a competitive marketplace for cars. It enables cost-efficient pickups. As you've heard us described in the U.S. in the past, every yard reduces towing costs and improves pickup times because every yard is closer to some of the cars than our current network would be. And lastly, it's worth knowing the -- worth noting the importance of buyer convenience. Because the majority of the cars that we sell through Copart Germany auctions are purchased by foreign buyers outside of Germany, having yards enables them -- enables our buyers to accumulate vehicles and pick them up more efficiently in larger batches. Regarding our progress beyond land, we are purchasing and selling vehicles in Germany at a meaningful positive spread at our Copart auction locations. Every car we buy and sell adds to our knowledge base and improves our ability to buy and sell the next subsequent car. Our intention is to run biweekly auctions at each of the sites we have announced with more to come. We're hiring staff for our yards as well as drivers for our trucking network. We use a combination of owned trucks and third-party sub-haulers to build out our logistics network. We've deployed our next-generation IT system, which we call [Cobalt] in Germany as well. Ultimately, we believe that the strategy we're pursuing in Germany is broadly applicable, with some local refinements to the other large economies in Western Europe. We started with the buyer in Germany and let's finish there as well. For the first time in Germany, the Copart Germany model will deliver an actual certain auction process, a buyer who bids on a car and provides the highest bid on the vehicle will ultimately own the car. We, for the buyer's benefit, now have the logistics benefit of multiple locations at which a buyer can store cars until they efficiently pick them up. As a general practice over the past 25 years or so, we tend to tell you what we've done after the fact as opposed to promising it in advance. We'll continue to honor that approach in general, but we recognize that Germany and Western Europe are substantial enough opportunities to warrant a more substantial check in, as we have provided today. We look forward to growing our business in Germany for many years to come. We're energized by the progress and momentum in Germany thus far and are excited by the size of the opportunities ahead of us. With that, we'll turn it back to the moderator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Kennison, Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the terrific summary on Germany. I had a question on the consumer experience in Germany. How does a German consumer find out about Copart or your listing service? And is there anything you need to do to promote the service in ways that you don't have to promote it in the U.S.? Jeffrey Liaw : The consumer, Craig, I would argue, is a participant today in the total loss process, as you heard us just describe. The insurance carrier provides them with the indemnification payment for their loss then hands them the details of an offer provided by a third party. It's then the consumer's responsibility to orchestrate that subsequent sale of the car to that winning bidder from the listing service. So if anything, in Germany today, the consumer is arguably too involved in that process. You can imagine you're trying to orchestrate the sale of a one-off vehicle from your home or from a repair shop to an individual you have never known in the past and will never see again in the future, may in fact even be picking up a car from a foreign country, is a complicated endeavor. I don't think that Copart's branding among consumers is essential in Germany. I think building our network and building our credibility with insurance companies and certainly with buyers, which I think you know we already have tremendous credibility with the international buyer base, that's much more important than winning the hearts and minds of consumers individually. Craig Kennison : So if you think of all of the totaled cars in Germany, to what extent are you getting a listing opportunity on those cars? What's your market share of listing opportunities, if you will, in Germany? Jeffrey Liaw : That's frankly hard to quantify, Craig, in part because for every car that it does experience a severe accident, like the carriers, generally speaking, will list the car on multiple services, WOM or Wreck Online Marketplace, the business I described a few moments ago, is certainly one of the handful of clear market leaders. So our market share position I described is strong without being able to quantify it. Craig Kennison : And then, the final question on Germany here. Just obviously, you are purchasing a higher percentage of cars there to more or less kickstart liquidity. Can you give us a feel for the economics of that? And how quickly you can turn a car? So if you invest a few thousand dollars in a car, how quickly does that car turn over? Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw : It turns over reasonably quickly. There the titling process is certainly not more complicated than it is in the U.S., for example, so the turnover isn't a challenge per se. The economics -- I think the punchline is that we have been able to buy the cars on these listing services subject to the same adverse selection problems I just described for the marketplace broadly, then turn and sell them to Copart Germany and earn positive profits in the process of doing so. I think the sample size at this point is probably not large enough to provide a deeper -- a very detailed unit economic P&L picture. The punchline is we are able to make money. It's evidence then that the current listing service model is inefficient and costing carriers and policyholders more than it should. Craig Kennison : Thanks for the detailed overview. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Bob Labick, CJS Securities. Lee Jagoda : Lee Jagoda for Bob. Good morning. So just following up on Germany. I think that you guys have about 11 yards in Germany today. What do you think the - what do you think you need to be fully built out in Germany? And how long do you think that, that process could take before we see multiple insurers actually buy in? Jayson Adair : Will you let me? Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. Jayson Adair : Okay. Well, we've announced to date eight locations, correct? Jeffrey Liaw : Seven. Jayson Adair : Seven, okay. We've announced 7 locations, and we will end up announcing 12 by the time we're done. I would argue, we've got enough of a network now, we can handle cars. So we've got more than enough capacity. We can pick vehicles up quickly, and we're not picking them up economically yet, but we'll be there very soon. I'd say within 90 days, we'll have the economic right, that we'll be happy with what it's costing to get a vehicle picked up. The next step is the marketplace. So by acquiring all these vehicles, as Jeff said, we're getting a strong feel for what they're worth, so we can be even more competitive, buying more vehicles and making a spread on those vehicles. So that will improve, but what's more important than really buying vehicles and making a spread is that we're creating a marketplace where our customers, when they come to Copart, they're guaranteed to get that car. This isn't about going on a platform, and 1 out of 100 times I submit a bid, I end up getting the car because most of the time I'm outbid, I don't know it. And then when I am a high bidder, the insured decides not to sell it to me because they flip it through the dealer to somebody else through adverse selection. So this is a sure thing, guaranteeing that when I bid on Copart, I will get the car. All of our auctions, or I should say, the majority of the cars that we're selling at auction are not on reserve, so there are no reserve auctions. So if you bid, you own it. So that has been our focus. Our focus has not been on getting insurance companies to come on board yet because it's about building the network, it's about building the logistics, it's about having the marketplace where buyers are coming every single day and finding product and buying that product. And by doing all that, through our people and our technology, we'll then go to the insurance companies and show them our spreads, very similar to what I said in my opening comments that we're going to show them the spreads we're making and say, why aren't you just processing it this way instead of doing it through the platforms? Additionally, as Jeff said, and this is one of the biggest parts for me, it's not only that we think there's money being left on the table [joining an] [ph] efficient marketplace, and that's why they list -- literally, there are major insurers that list on all three of the major platforms because they'll get different bids through the platforms. So that piece is important. But to me, what's more important is that you're -- in Germany, you are telling the insured that your vehicle is worth \u20ac30,000 prior to the accident, and it's now worth \u20ac10,000 after the accident. And you're giving them a check with \u20ac20,000 and telling them to dispose of the vehicle through a buyer that they have no idea what the process is. So not only do they have the option of selling to that buyer, but then they've got someone that is at the shop or maybe the vehicle is at their home, and they've got a adjustor that's talking to them and they're an appraiser and they're working all these to figure out who should I sell the vehicle to in the end and have to deal with that. So it clearly is our belief that if they're given a check for \u20ac30,000 and the vehicle is picked up and disposed of, and they never have to deal with it, it's a far superior customer experience from the insurance company's perspective and from the insured's perspective. Lee Jagoda : All right. That makes all the sense in the world. Just so I'm clear, though, how many, if any, insurance companies are currently participating on your platform today? And as outsiders, what are the next milestones we should be looking for? Jayson Adair : Yes. We have a few, let's say, three, maybe four customers that are really starting to utilize the website now to sell vehicles, but it's not in any way material yet. They're more wanting to try to recover bad vehicles, some hail-damaged vehicles, et cetera, to dispose of those vehicles. And there's a transformation that has to take place where they're not just dealing with inventory that they're stuck with in the sense of recovering [bad] [ph], hail damaged, but that they actually say that this is the process going forward. And again, I can't -- I really can't state it enough, Jeff and I and the rest of the team have been making a number of trips to Germany in the last 6 months, and I can't tell you how confident I am that we're going to see insurers that will switch their process. It's just -- the numbers don't lie. When you look at the returns we're getting on vehicles and you see the amount of times that the insured sells the vehicle somewhere other than the platform, those two combined plus the experience for the customer, I think you're going to see in the next six months some customers switching their process and converting to Copart and the Copart model. Lee Jagoda : That sounds great. Thank you very much for the color. Jayson Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin, Suntrust. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. I just kind of want to go back and again on Germany and kind of thinking through here, obviously you know, there's a lot that \u2013 lot that's been done in the last year from building infrastructure, the IT system and just what I'm assuming there a whole lot of investments in the initiative. So just kind of if we think going forward, should we be expecting significantly more investments or this is kind of the run rate and -- to kind of look at it at this point going forward? Or just kind of trying to get a gauge on where we are from just an investment standpoint? And then lastly, I just kind of wanted to follow up on the last question and just thinking about if you have received any pushback for insurance companies or any reasons so far, or maybe they're not just getting it, why they wouldn't immediately switch just considering the returns you can show them, that would be great? Thanks again. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. I think as you know, we tend not to grant any forward-looking guidance on any aspect of our P&L, revenue costs or otherwise. But in short, I think you can tell from this description today that we have made real strides in Germany but still have meaningful growth aspirations from here as well. So certainly, our hope is that we are investing much more capital because that's a reflection then of ongoing growth in the business. I don't think we're prepared to quantify that or any point there. As to your second question about any resistance from insurance carriers, I don't think there is a lack of willingness or interest. I think the point is that our model, like the one in Germany, has evolved for a reason. And there are tax and regulatory and commercial practices that have been long-standing in Germany. This is a rather different model, I think, very clearly superior, but it certainly will take time to prove to them. As Jay was describing, unit price for car purchase [indiscernible] but the economics are overwhelming. And so there's no resistance per se. I'd say strong interest, strong curiosity in our model. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro, Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up a quick one on Germany. I think you guys mentioned, there are three major platforms in the German market. But given the higher returns that you're generating with your model, does any of the incumbent players have the ability or desire to change strategy as you guys are succeeding in that market? Jeffrey Liaw : We haven't seen any indication that they are, that they have the desire. And I think we have a fairly strong belief that they wouldn't have the ability regardless. So recall that a majority of the buyers at Copart Germany today are international, so that's on the back of Copart's global reputation, on the back of Copart's already established international buyer base. If somebody tried to replicate that from scratch solely for the purposes of having a more active listing service in Germany, I think that would be a tall order. So no, there's no indication that they have endeavored to do so and [indiscernible]. Daniel Imbro : Okay. And then staying over there in Europe. With Brexit in the U.K. right now, can you maybe talk through how you guys think different outcomes could play out in your business? Or for one, what percentage of the U.K. business is exported to Continental Europe and how potential Brexit outcome could change or disrupt your U.K operations? Jeffrey Liaw : I think we - you saw from the disruption a couple of years ago and a year ago, currency fluctuations, that certainly affects our business, as you know, in multiple ways. And so when the pound is weaker, the earnings reflect our P&L at a much lower U.S. dollar rate. That said, I think Brexit clearly remains very much TBD as the portion of cars that are sold outside of the U.K. are disposed of [indiscernible]. So there are cars in the U.K. that go to other places within Europe and probably beyond Europe as well. We expect trade to continue of those cars. Under precisely what tariffs and under what regime will ultimately emerge, I think, remains to be seen. Daniel Imbro : Okay. Great. And then one last one, moving back to the U.S. business. We seem to have seen U.S. salvage industry growth slowing a little bit. And part of that is noise from the CAT events but even so shaking out sort of the mid-single-digit range. What are you guys seeing in the industry today? And has your volume outlook that you've previously indicated of kind of high single digit industry growth, has that changed at all? Thanks. William Franklin : Not really. It may have moderated slightly. But given the difficulty in getting land, we really haven't reduced our efforts in expansion in any meaningful manner. And these trends, we try not to react for quarterly changes in trends. We think that in the long run that we're going to see increases in total loss frequency just because of all the dynamics that you all heard about, pre and post-repair expansions of scans and -- or complex cars and younger cars, all that intuitively leads us to the conclusion that total loss frequency will continue to fall. Daniel Imbro : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri, Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking the questions. First one, so the global inventory ex CAT was up 10% or ex hurricanes, let me call it that way, and volume was up 4%. I guess, how many points of that inventory growth was from international? And then like what else would you attribute the accelerate from? William Franklin : We kind of gave that. I mean, international is up 14% and U.S. is up 10.4%, so there was growth internationally. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. And why such strong growth in inventory growth in the U.S. then looking forward? What do you say that's driving that? William Franklin : Well, we don't predict. We've been looking backwards and say that our average volume growth rate over the last 17 quarters has been 10%. And then, there will be natural fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We really don't see influences change significantly that have driven that thus far, so we think it's going to be in that range. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. But I'm trying to understand the European market a little bit better both on the supply side and the demand side. At this point, if you're not sourcing from the insurers, is it super majority of your purchases coming from listing services? And then what were mix like of your own wreck listing service versus the third party ones? Jeffrey Liaw : Well, I mean, - a handful of customers who are consigning cars to us, but still, the strong majority of the cars sold in Copart Germany today are cars purchased on our listing service. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then demand side, can you talk about the customer mix, how that might differ from what you see in the U.S.? And give us a sense of - I don't think there's a very big salvaged part industry in Europe yet today. So can you maybe talk about how the buyers are different and kind of how you see it evolving, if you do, just to remain in this market? Jeffrey Liaw : I think the buyers are ultimately somewhat similar because they are from outside of Germany. So some of the countries that are meaningful buyers, even of Copart U.S. cars today have become the buyers of Copart Germany vehicles as well. They are no doubt dismantling a portion of the cars for parts and are no doubt rebuilding a good number of them as they put back on the road as well. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Thanks for the help. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Morning, everyone. Will, you cited various categories of growth in the noninsurance side. I thought it was dealers were up 29%. Could you give me the other segments and the growth that we saw there? William Franklin : Sure. Our finance companies, which includes banks and leasing companies, was up 11%. Wholesalers, up 4%. Rental car companies was up 30%. And fleet and industrial equipment companies were up 77%. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. And then you had 25% of your total U.S. volume in this quarter was noninsurance. What was the percentage last year? Do you have that handy? William Franklin : I do. It was a little over 22%. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then, Jeff, with these noninsurance cars, I would assume that they get sold a hell of a lot faster than the salvaged vehicles. You don't have to put a title and settle with an insurance company on that. Does that - as these grow as a percentage of your U.S. cars sold, does that kind of somewhat distort your inventory growth in a sense of that these cars are flushing out a lot quicker versus the salvage cars? Jeffrey Liaw : It can. So each segment that we talked about has its own profile, its own characteristics. So while you might make a sense about a quicker cycle time overall, some segments are actually a slower cycle time. But in general, you're right. It has a - as a group, a quicker cycle time, and therefore, increases the velocity of our yards, improves the utility of our land. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then just so I make sure I'm understanding Germany. Germany, if an owner retained, you're actually still going to the owner and buying the car, correct? You're not -- the insurance company is not retaining the car in what you've built? Jayson Adair : Correct. Gary Prestopino : Okay. All right. Do you - and I know, Jay, you mentioned that you're obviously -- you're going to try and do the same strategy that you used in the U.K. to move from a principal agency over time, but are there any U.K. insurers that are writing in Germany right now that could maybe be take the lead in this and kind of start budging the German insurance companies towards going to this contingent basis? Jayson Adair : Yes. Gary, we're just in the process right now of preparing the data to share it. So our approach has been very simple. We felt without a marketplace and without a network, we couldn't offer an insurer the vehicle and unit our service and then have to tow it 6 hours north at the Hanover. So we've got the network now. We've got results of the auctions that we can share. And it's really about sharing our data in the next 90 days. And one of the most compelling parts of this to me is, yes, we're making a spread, you can see that, and that's great. But one of the most compelling parts is the fact that the -- when they're a high bidder on one of the platforms, when a buyer is a high bidder on one of the platforms, and that high bidder that's given to the insured, that the majority of the time, the insured doesn't sell it to them. But there's a whole secondary auction that's taking place. That's the problem. And the platform price is the number that the insurance company uses. So that's the number that they're saying, okay, your car is worth 10 grand. It was 30 before the accident. Here's a check for 20, and this buyer will buy it off you. And then the majority of the time, the insured does not sell it to that buyer. Instead, they go out into the secondary market through people that work at the BMW dealership that's doing the repair, through other sources. They're going out because we came out to them. And it's not too hard in Germany, we figured that out. It's not too hard in Germany to figure out where a damaged -- obviously, in the U.S., I give the example. It's not too hard to figure out where a damaged Ferrari is in Dallas. There is not that many dealerships. When you get into Germany, it's not that hard to figure out where a damaged BMW or a Mercedes is in Munich, and so you can make phone calls and talk to them, or you even have a route where you just walk into the dealerships and you look at the salvaged and they put you in touch with the insurance and you're buying that product off of them for more than the platform bid. So this is really about showing the insurance guy it's not only a better service for the insured, but it's about showing them that there's this whole secondary auction, it's an inefficient marketplace. And the biggest frustration, we talked to our buyers, why do they love Copart so much, the biggest frustration is they bid on the platforms and the majority of the time, they don't get the car. They bid on Copart, 100% of the time, they get the car. And that allows a buyer to know exactly what they're going to repair. If they need parts, they've got the parts. If they're going to do a rebuild, they've got the vehicle for rebuild. And then, they can store it at Copart for the next two weeks while they build to run and send a truck out to pick 9 cars up and haul them back to Poland. So that really -- the benefits there are really obvious, and it's just about us in the next 90 days articulating that now to customers. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you very much. Jayson Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from James Albertine, Consumer Edge. James Albertine : Thank you so much and good morning to everybody. Great details on Germany. A lot of questions, obviously, already, and I know you don't give guidance. So I wanted to ask sort of a real-world-looking question here a little bit. Are you - can you tell us, rather, if you're on plan or if you're slightly ahead of plan with respect to your -- what you'd budgeted for growth in Germany? And the reason I ask, given the radical change you're bringing to the market and the tax and regulatory setup. I want to understand what the impetus may have been, whether it's consolidation of buyers or sellers or what have you, that may have accelerated the investment there in Germany, and if we could think about the rest of Europe potentially being a little bit faster as that market consolidates over time? Jayson Adair : Okay. Well, I think the big change is that we have spent the last two years trying to understand the marketplace with a single location, and it's a learning process. The first part I'd say, you've got to learn how the market works, and there is been a lot of us trying to figure out, okay, why it's the insured - why is our buyer on our platform the high bidder and they don't get the car? And then, you eventually realize as you reach out and make phone calls and talk to people, you find out and you kind of decipher how the marketplace works. And that's how we've now come to the conclusion that there's a secondary auction that takes place and a bunch of other facts that we know about the marketplace. And I would say that it's a big investment in time and it's a big investment in dollars, and we want to make sure that we knew that our model in our minds would work. And we came to that conclusion this year, and that's why we opened up so many locations to build the network of facilities, where we can pick cars up quickly, store them, liquidate them at auction and replicate that process over and over and over. So it was really about being prudent in our approach upfront and learning, and we've spent the last two years doing that. And now we're in a very quick pace to accelerate the market in terms of units going through auction and accelerate the market in terms of getting clients to convert now to the Copart model. And this is simple math, right? They're going to convert, and the insurer is going to be happier that they don't have to deal with a buyer coming at 8 :00 at night to pick the vehicle up, and so that's a win. They're going to see Net Promoter Score increases from a customer service standpoint, and they're going to see more money in their pocket because they're not losing the vehicle in the secondary auction. So this should benefit the insured and benefit the insurance company. And our research so far proves that to be the case. Did you want to add to that? Jeffrey Liaw : No. James Albertine : Maybe as a quick follow-up, Jay, if I may. Given the progress you made, the learnings and the breakthrough you've had or it seems that you're having in Germany, does that lower the degree of difficulty to go laterally kind of across Europe? Or will you have to effectively start over in a similar way as you did in Germany if you were to shift into other markets? And then, if I can ask one, Jeff. You talked about the economics. You said it's profitable with your ROIC over time. I would guess this is a very compelling opportunity economically. But from a modeling perspective, and there's no guidance here, but I wanted to get a sense. This must be coming on as sort of dilutive to your corporate EBITDA margin near term, I would imagine. Is that a fair assessment while you're maturing in that market? Jeffrey Liaw : So let me tackle those questions individually. First is your question as to the rest of Western Europe. It's certainly the case that we're building the muscle memory now to understand how to roll out in a market with some of the nuances and its own refinements. Certainly, our ability to succeed in Germany will inform our approaches in other countries. So there's -- there will be additional work to be done, so it's not simply replicating the next morning and staying in France or otherwise. But I think we have -- we will have enhanced our capabilities and enhance our reputation, and the friction should be lower for the next iterations of this approach. As for the profitability of the model, I'd first note that given the principal nature of it, I suppose, if you want to literally talk about the math on a -- because they're principal cars, they are clearly dilutive to the margin rates both on the gross line and the operating profit line. As for how the balance of it will evolve over time, I think we just have to be patient and see in future quarters. We're not in a position to provide a forecast. James Albertine : Understood and appreciate it. And best of luck. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Bret Jordan, Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Jeffrey Liaw : Good morning. Bret Jordan : My star one was broken. A quick - I might have missed this. Did you size the German market, how many cars total there annually? Jeffrey Liaw : We haven't. We characterize it as substantially larger than the U.K. market. For example, just by comparison, I think if you look at the metrics, whether it's population, GDP per capita, GDP, et cetera, I think we believe it's meaningfully larger than the U.K. And we view the Western European market collectively as being similar or larger than the U.S. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And then a question on the noninsurance U.S. vehicle. Do a higher percentage of those go to export in the sense that there's less concern around a condition report, whether it's essentially a whole car, is your export shifting as that mix shifts? William Franklin : Certainly, some are appropriate for the export market, but I would say that the -- without knowing exactly -- without looking it up, I wouldn't think it'd be too materially different than our normal export percentages. So 35% is probably an appropriate expectation. Jeffrey Liaw : Right. Directionally, probably a little bit higher because -- simply because the scrap cars are sold in the States. So a local car that's going to be melted down pretty much right away will be sold within a pretty narrow radius location of the yard. And so simply by virtue of dealer cars generally not being melted down, there's probably a higher mix that go in export, but I don't think the difference would be dramatic. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Jayson Adair : All right. Thanks, Chantelle. Thank you, everyone, for attending the first quarter call for Copart, and we look forward to reporting on next year, and wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this conference has now concluded. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter call for Copart. On the call with me today is Jeff Liaw, CFO and Will Franklin, Executive Vice President. I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw for opening comments and then Will Franklin will give us an update on operations and then we'll be happy to answer any questions that we have at that time. All right thanks so much. Jeff? Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Jay. I'll start with the Safe Harbor. During today\u2019s call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effects of disposals of non-operating assets, foreign-currency-related gains and losses, the impact of income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings, net of deferred tax changes and certain income tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday afternoon. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. Now I'll turn our attention to the second quarter of our fiscal 2019. We're pleased with our operating results. I'll start also with a reminder that the first six months of fiscal 2018 were distorted by Hurricane Harvey over those first two quarters of fiscal 2018 we incurred losses of nearly 10 million on an operating basis. Q2 in isolation, would reflect a gain because the first quarter of 2018 disproportionally captured storm related costs while the second quarter we disproportionally captured storm related revenue. I will make it a point over the course of this call to communicate our key metrics with and without the effects of Hurricane Harvey. We achieved a record second quarter in revenue, gross profits and operating income, starting with our nominal global revenue growth of 5.6% with an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect of $4.9 million from foreign operations primarily due to the relative strength of the dollar in comparison to the pounds and the Brazilian Real. Excluding the effect of Hurricane Harvey our revenue growth was 17% even. Our global service revenue growth was 3.7% year-over-year and again excluding Hurricane Harvey was 13.7%. We typically suggest looking to service revenue and service revenue growth as the more accurate indicator of underlying business activity. Our purchased car growth of 19.1% year-over-year driven largely by our international businesses split approximately equally between the UK and Germany. A quick reminder that our Copart owned inventory remains relatively small at $28.3 million at quarter end which is small in the context of course of the overall business. Turning to unit sales our nominal global units declined slightly at 0.6% year-over-year with a slight U.S. unit decline of 3.7% and international unit growth of 18.7%. Again excluding Hurricane Harvey, our global unit sales grew at 7.7%, U.S. units grew 5.7% and excluding Harvey and charities volumes for [indiscernible] U.S. number our volumes grew 7.5% year-over-year. Our U.S. unit growth was driven by both our insurance and non-insurance segments which Will will describe in greater detail in a few minutes. Then turning to inventory, our nominal global inventory grew at 6.6% year-over-year, excluding the effect of Hurricane Harvey our inventory grew 7.7%. For the quarter, our gross profits grew 8.7% year-over-year excluding Harvey, that same number would be 13.6% year-over-year growth. Our gross margin rate increased from 41.7% a year ago to 42.9% this year, so approximately 120 basis points lift. Excluding the effect of Harvey our gross margin compressed slightly approximately 1% which is explained almost entirely by the slight mixed shift through purchased car revenue. Our average selling prices for vehicles at Copart auctions in the United States excluding Hurricane Harvey, grew 15.4% year-over-year. That compares to 16.1% growth a year ago, so 15.4% this year and $16.1 a year ago for the same quarter. Will again will provide more context on this phenomenon, a reflection both of the type of cars that are consigned, the Copart as well as the expansion and marketing efforts that we pursue with our Copart member base.  Turning to our general and administrative expenditures, excluding stock compensating and depreciation were up from $29.7 million a year ago to $33.2 million this year were down $1.6 million sequentially versus the first quarter of 2019. Repeating a mantra that you've heard before in general, G&A expenditures will vary from quarter to quarter and will grow over time with inflation and complexity [ph] we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage given the topline growth we experienced. Our GAAP operating income growth was $9.1% for the quarter, excluding Hurricane Harvey, that same operating income would have grown at 15.5%. Our net interest expense as you can see is down slightly year-over-year given our lower average net debt balance. Our other income of $4.8 million is largely a gain on sale of assets specifically in our replaced data center, you also see that adjusted out in our non-GAAP reconciliation. Our second quarter income tax rate was 20.4% a reflection of the lower U.S. federal tax rate and we discussed in our prior calls, as well as one time benefits from stock option exercises which will again reflect in the non-GAAP presentation. Our GAAP net income increased from $103.3 million a year ago to $131.4 million this year for the second quarter an crease of 27.2% year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income grew 11.5% year-over-year excluding the effects of Hurricane Harvey and including an assumption for tax rates that same growth rate would be 18% plus or minus for non-GAAP net income year-over-year. The non-GAAP schedule we've already talked about the major adjustments on that page for the second quarter for this year, which include, both the disposal of non-operating assets as well as the excess tax deduction for stock option exercises. I'll just quickly remind folks that the major adjustment for last year of the second quarter was the $10 million adjusted of the one-time transition tax charge, that\u2019s a reflection of the tax reform spent in that quarter. I'll turn our attention briefly to Germany, before coming back then to the balance sheet and cash flow. We encourage folks for further background to review the transcript of our first quarter earnings call where we described in much greater detail the nature of the market and our efforts there and it represented a one-time deep dive so to speak into the business. But as a quick substantive update we now have 12 locations up and running in physical footprint across the country. At Copart Germany we are now running daily auctions across those locations with a strong majority of our volumes sold to buyers outside of Germany. We think that reflects the power of the Copart brand name, our buyer network and technology platform and it frankly is a strong testament to the inefficiency of the current market model for total losses in Germany. Our unit sales in Copart Germany are approximately eight times the same volume for a year ago for the second quarter. We also continue to demonstrate our ability to purchase cars through Wreck Online, the listing service that we own and to show them that a positive margin at Copart Germany auctions. As you know, we also continue our dialogue in parallel with insurance carriers in Germany and believe that a Copart model akin to what we have in the U.S. and in the UK is ultimately the right answer for that market as well for a host of reasons including both total loss and claims costs for carriers as well as the claims experience for policy holders. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $107.5 million with gross CapEx of $74.4 million. About 60% of the CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buy outs with the balance attributable to maintenance and other activities. We also purchased 7.6 million shares of Copart stock in the open market at a weighted average price just below $48. The total outlays are approximately $365 million. We founded these purchases with cash on hand and revolver draw of $93 million as provided at the end of the quarter. We still have available liquidity of more than $750 million. With that, I'll turn the call over to EVP, Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. Let me provide a few more comments about our operational performance for the second quarter. Copart once again delivered another strong quarter. Our U.S. volume when adjusted to the Harvey activity in the same quarter last year grew by 5.7%. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth and market wins within the insurance market and our continued expansion into noninsurance markets. Organic growth in the salvage market is driven we believe by an increase in total loss frequency. As high repair cost at our elevated auction returns are leading to a higher percentage of claims resulting in an economic total loss. The growth in our auction returns has significantly outpaced the growth in used car values. Using January 2017 as a baseline the Manheim Used Car Index has growth 8.4%. Using the same baseline, ASPs were generating at our U.S. auctions for only insurance cars has grown by 35%. While the rest of the industry is quickly moving toward the digital remarketing convention we have been completely digital since 2003 when reintroduced our BB2 platform. We have continually improved our awesome platform, now BB3. Over the last 16 years is commonly recognized as the standard in the industry. The addition of CO BB3 [ph] and our elevated marketing focus on international buyers have left to a significant growth in bidding activity from those buyers. Our full U.S. website is now translated into seven languages. In addition, we have elements of our website that accommodate languages native to 135 countries and currently we sell from the U.S. into 147 countries. In the quarter, 38.4% of all U.S. units sold were to international buyers and 46.9% of the value of the units sold were to international buyers. In total, over 70% of all the vehicles sold on a U.S. website received at least one bid from an international buyer. Our marketing efforts have two goals, to bring more buyers to our auctions and to get those who attends to place more bids. We have been successful in both efforts. The number of unique bidders was up 13% and the number of bids received per lot sold was up 8%. Breaking down the growth in unique bidder further, we saw an 11% increase in domestic bidders and 22% increase in the international unique bidders. Growth in ASPs [ph] has been the primary driver and 6.4% increase in the U.S. per car. Also contributing to that growth are the additional services we are providing to both, the buyers and the sellers. The non-insurance markets continued to be a focus of growth in our U.S. strategy. These markets include franchise independent dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. Excluding the charity and municipality markets in the U.S. our noninsurance volume grew by almost 20% and by more than 100% over the same quarter last year, same quarter two years ago, respectively. The growth in volumes was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 14%. Finance companies 24%, wholesalers 24%, rental car companies 62% and fleets and industrial equivalent were up 41%. We have successfully grown our non-insurance volume as we develop better systems integration and deflates banks and dealerships as we have developed sales and operational programs targeting individual segments. And as we continue to increase the auction returns that we're delivering to our non-insurance sellers. Turning to the UK, we delivered another very strong quarter as we saw growth and volume of 11.8%. In local currency, revenue and EBIT grew by 21.7% and 23% respectively. The growth in volume came from increases in both the insurance business driven once again by market wins and organic growth and growth in our non-insurance business as we grew out UK volume. We also continue to see meaningful growth in both Brazil and Canada. As the value we offer in terms of technology, processes, land and people, has allowed us to expand our market share in those countries. In Canada we increased our volume in our local currency revenue by 8.4% and 21.5% respectively. In Brazil our growth was even more remarkable, increasing our volume and our local currency revenue by 22% and 36.5% respectively. Jeff has already provided commentary on Germany. With that, we note that our operations outside of the Americas, the UK and Germany for the quarter remain immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. Globally we are seeing raising labor, health insurance and sample cost all of which have led to an increase in our average cost to process each car. Our inventory was up in the U.S. internationally and worldwide by 5.9, 11.1, and 6.6 respectively. When adjusted for Harvey, the growth in the U.S. internationally and worldwide with 7.2, 11.1, and 7.7 respectively. The year-over-year growth in our U.S. inventory over the prior eight quarters, has averaged over 9% and we expect this trend to continue. To accommodate this growth and to provide standalone capacity along the Gulf of Mexico and the East Coast we have engaged in a massive capacity expansion. In the last three weeks alone we have announced New York and Harleyville, South Carolina serving the Charleston area, [indiscernible] California serving the North Bay and Sacramento areas and Mocksville, North Califormia serving the Charlotte area. Until these three are exited over 114 anchors of capacity. So far this fiscal year, we have announced 14 new facilities, 4 in the U.S., one each in Brazil and Canada, and 8 in Germany. Currently in the U.S. we have 17 expansion projects in the construction phase and 29 projects in the engineering phase. These 46 projects alone represent thousands of acres of capacity and will consume several hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. That concludes my comments. Todd, I'll turn the call back over to your for the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. Bob Labick : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Jeffrey Liaw : Hi Bob, good morning. Bob Labick : Hi, a couple real quick questions on Germany and then one on the noninsurance group which is very impressive that you just talked about. Starting with Germany, obviously over the last, I guess six to 12 months you've really accelerated your pace of rollout in your road share, can you talk about what has surprised you the most over the last 6 to 12 months during this kind of acceleration phase? William Franklin : I think the biggest surprise is just how well the team performed in terms of opening up so many yards so quickly. When we got there this summer and started looking at changing our strategy in terms of what would make us the more successful, we realized we needed a network and that's what worked for us in the U.S., the UK and other markets, Brazil, Canada. As we have a stronger network we have a better an easier ability to pick up cars quickly and provide our services and really just the team's performance and ability to do that is probably the most surprising thing. Second I would say is just the amount of buyers that we've been able to bring in. Once we started to hold auctions and we're auctioning well over 500 cars a week now, once we started that process and had regular auctions available to the members, the marketing teams has just done a really great job on getting our brand out there and cultivating buyers for our auction. So it's been very positive. We talked about it in the past. And like Jeff's comments which are let us succeed and performed and then we'll report on those results, but we're very happy with what we see in Germany. Bob Labick : Okay, great and I know you want to succeed and perform first, but I just wanted one more question and then I'll move off it. I know you talked about potentially over the next severe quarters flipping your insurance company to the U.S. style, do you still believe that's possible or likely and if that doesn\u2019t happen over the next couple of quarters what would be the reason that it wouldn\u2019t happen? William Franklin : Well, I do think it's going to happen. The reason that will happen is associated with friction that you have today with the process. So you are acquiring the insured to hold the vehicle and then have some buyer come to their house and pick the vehicle up and there is an insurance company the IMET in Germany, yes it isn\u2019t concerned with customer service and net promoters scores and giving the best possible brand experience that they can give. And obviously when we send uniformed driver in and pick the vehicle up, bring it to our location, then auction it. The end buyers picking up at our location, you don\u2019t have that touch with the buyer and the insurer and that could be a negative. There could be a number of scenarios that I could outline for you where the buyer ends up playing double conversations with the insured about the salvage, and clearly there has not the insurance company that wants that. Second reason is returns. We are able to buy cars. As Jeff has mentioned on previous cars we're able to buy cars basically through the platforms and then bring them over to the yards and auction them off and get a higher return. And that is just very, very simple. You are allowing buyers from around the country and the world to bid on product that they know they are going to get. There is no contingency, there is no question if they bid they are going to own it, whereas when they bid on the platforms there is less than 10% chance of knowing you're going to get the vehicle. If they are a high bidder they may not get the vehicle because insurer may sell it somewhere else trough a body shop or through some other, through the dealership rather than to the buyer. So you're taking away that element of unknown and making it a sure guarantee that you're going to get the vehicle. And then you have the logistical component. And we said this before it should not be underestimated. When a buyer has to, when a buyer bids on something and has to pick it up and go to three different locations, three different insurance homes and pick that vehicle up within a certain amount of timeframe that as a degree of difficulty, when a buyer can bid on three different Copart locations and buy a half a dozen or a dozen vehicles, so they can get a lot more product. And then they can take three weeks to pick it up as opposed to having to get it out within four days. That's just better experience for the buyer as well. So I guess, I don't have any doubt at this point that we're going to see continued traction in that market. Bob Labick : Great, that was very helpful color. Thank you. And then just one last quick one, obviously you just discussed very impressive growth of non-insurance from dealers finance, wholesalers, rental cars, et cetera, who are the primary buyers of these, are these the new unique bidder is coming online or just talk a little bit about the buyer base there, how may be different than your core or if it is exactly the same? Jayson Adair : No, Bob I think the profile of our buyer base changes constantly based on the product that we're offering and you're seeing buyers that have an appetite for these different types of cars and even heavy equipment that we're offering and that's that just demonstrates the efficiency of our auction platform. We easily get those buyers, those buyers easily get us and are able to view these cars. Jeffrey Liaw : Bob I'll just add to that, but I think both are true. So we expand as the nature of the cars that we offer evolves our buyer base expands further as well, but it's also true that the existing buyer base is thirsty for the kind of cars that are offered by the dealer and consigners. Otherwise by the way they wouldn't consign through us, as much as we'd like to say we're fantastic four independent dealers and so forth. They vote with their feet and they vote as a reflection of the auction prices they achieve at Cobalt auctions. So I think it's a testament to the power of that buyer network that they're doing quite well and bringing more cars to go cart over time. I think that also has a virtuous slight cycle effect as well because then those newer or less damaged or non damaged cars then bring further buyers into the network as well. So I think it's a marketplace that continues to expand on both sides, buyers and sellers. Bob Labick : Great. Thanks very much. Jayson Adair : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Thank you for taking my questions. Well, I wanted to start with you on the non-insurance business continue to see great growth there. Can you just provide examples of systems integration tools that you're using to drive your non-insurance volumes with dealer's, fleet operators or rental companies? Jayson Adair : I mean each species segments tend to migrated to a different platform for their system operations. For example, the finance companies use a system called Auto IMS. The dealers use a dealer track or dealer socket. Number of those other systems, the buyers seem to come to us Auction access and it's extremely important for us to write the integrations that are needed to reduce any friction that is caused by operating two different systems, our systems and their the resistance our system and theirs. And we have a sniff gate initiative along the lines of creating those integrations and that's just part of, it is not just the systems it's the processes. For example, heavy equipment, transportation piece of heavy equipment could cost 4, $5,000 as opposed to well under a $100 for an insurance company. The tiling process for charities where you got to pick up the title when you pick up car is completely different the tiling processes for dealerships. Dealers are much more concerned and in need of after auction services like counter bidding. And I can go on and on. Finance companies have rules that surround repossessions even voluntary repossessions with which we have to provide special documentation and compliance. And so it just not a matter of being integrated into their software systems as it is being able to change our process to accommodate their specific needs. Craig Kennison : That helps, and then to what extent is the growth fueled by new customers trying your services versus customers that you've already landed that are dramatically increasing the use of your service? Jayson Adair : It's both. We're seeing organic growth. We're seeing people, customers that we've had for years that we're contacting again. We're like I said eliminate the friction, whether it's systematic or process, encouraging them to send us cards and the returns that they're receiving have driven more and more volume. It is not one of the big things. It's a combination of a lot more things that we're doing internally. Craig Kennison : Got it. And then I also wanted to ask about the total loss rate trend in the U.S. and in Europe. Where do you think that loss rate is headed in 2019 and beyond. And then when you look at Europe, do you have any data to frame where the total loss rate is headed in 2019 and beyond and where that may be headed. William Franklin : Right, I'll comment on the first part of your question. That's total loss rate, I think this is as you know the one way tailwind behind the business for the last 40 years, so that there are cars that went through accidents are ever prone to be in totaled than repaired. I think that's an unassailable macro factor that's really hard to read on a micro basis, so trying to forecast that quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year is tough. We do think the overwhelming forces at work here will drive it upwards over time, there is no particular ceiling that we have in mind. So I don't have a good point in time forecast for Q4, 2009. As for Europe, I think the data we haven't seen a comprehensive data source that's quite as exhaustive as CCC here in the U.S. so don't have a comparable number to share with you. The UK as you know is very different from Germany for example even at how they practice or how they handle total losses. But no we don't have any point estimates as precisely as the major sources we have here in the US. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. William Franklin : Thanks Craig. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey good morning guys. On the purchased car trend in Germany is it possible to get the agency volumes up without flipping the insurance companies in the sense that, if the individual is still selling the car once you have enough option traffic will they send you the car on consignment as opposed to you having to buy it? William Franklin : Right now we're acquiring cars so that we can hold auctions, so we're doing that through the platform. We do have some non-insurance volume coming in now as well. So we're starting to process the vehicles for companies that service the insurance industry as well as rental car companies. But currently the strategy is to illustrate the benefits to the large insurers and then have them switch over to our model. Bret Jordan : Okay great. And then on Will's comments around the real estate pipeline, could you put maybe some timeframe around those thousands of acres, is that going to be a very large near-term acquisition of real estate or is that 46 projects over a period of years? Jayson Adair : I think years is too long. I think within 24 months, the vast majority of all those 47 projects should be delivered. Bret Jordan : Okay great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey good morning everyone. Hey Will, when you talked about the non-insurance did you give the percentage breakdown of what percentage of vehicles were non-insurance this quarter versus last year or can you give that? Hello? Jayson Adair : Yes, so do you have any other question [indiscernible]? Gary Prestopino : Oh certainly I do. In terms of the gross margin on the purchase vehicles it was - sequentially it was down a couple hundred basis points. Is that just an impact of more growth in Germany or is that currency or what? Jayson Adair : It is a reflection in parts of growth in Germany. It is largely not currency because currency would affect both sides of that ledger area right across \u2013 partially Germany, it is partially also that purchased car mix can affect this as well. So as the prices for example can rise for certain purchased cars, we've talked about this before, but the more a car bought and sold for more - dollars spread grows shrink not expect on a $10,000 car to make double the profit that you would on a $5,000 purchased car for what it's worth. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then lastly, I wanted to ask about the vehicle pooling costs they were - year-over-year they were up pretty dramatically, what would account for that? Jeffrey Liaw : That's largely the effect of the accounting change Gary. So it - to make a long story short, anyway check this [indiscernible] I think quite a pretty robust discussion there of how the accounting now forces us what revenue, we use to pull more revenue forward, now we push more to the back which hangs more of it on the balance sheet which is - and the corresponding costs which is why BPC is up so dramatically. Gary Prestopino : Yes, okay, that would explain it. And then lastly Jeff, I got on the call late, I actually got booked into the wrong call. Could you give me some of those unit volume numbers that you generally address at the beginning of the call or unit volume changes or whatever? Jeffrey Liaw : Yes I'll give you the big one, so unit sales, nominal unit sales declined 0.6%, U.S. unit declined 3.7%, international growth of 18.7%, excluding Hurricane Harvey, global unit sales growth of 7.7%, U.S. unit growth of 5.7 ex Harvey and ex charities we said in the U.S. with 7.5%. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Jayson Adair : Gary, I got that number for you on the percentage of non-insurance vehicles sold last quarter, the U.S. is 22.9% and the same for last year was 20.8%. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Jayson Adair : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just hoping you could disaggregate the increase in average selling prices. I would think some of its mix, or it may be just look at what the ASPs have done to sort of the insurance segment? Jayson Adair : You're right. Of course some of it is mix and we don\u2019t - we haven\u2019t separated the impact of the change in mix versus the increase in ASPs solely for insurance companies. So I'm not sure we could provide that to you on the call. Jayson Adair : I think Will will provide the stats on Manheim on a two-year basis and U.S. insurance only being up 35%/ Jeffrey Liaw : Right, but not the impact it has on revenue. Jayson Adair : So, right not the impact on revenue. But the point is that ASPs are up and up significantly year-over-year including for the insurance segment in isolation. So it's not just mix shift, it is also significant increases in insurance ASPs in the United States. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That's what I am trying to arrive at. So when you think about what's driving this, is there any metrics you can cite in terms of like the total loss rates, are you saying that total loss rates are increasing and more of younger vehicles than for older vehicles or anything you can demonstrate, you used to demonstrate that like there's a younger vehicle being totaled today than maybe historically? Jayson Adair : I think the themes you've heard us talk about on the last few calls all still hold true, which is that we are seeing on average slightly newer cars being totaled. So if we look at the model year of the car we sell. We are selling more newer cars today than we were a year ago and that's been true for a while. We are also selling less damaged cars, so the cars are totally more easily. We have certain metrics to the insurance companies do rather they provide them to us regarding repair estimates. So how much is the repair estimate relative to the intact value of the car. And we are seeing by that particular barometer, less damage cars entering our system over time. On the flip side of this is all the bidding phenomenon that Will described. So I think we are seeing newer and less damaged cars on the supply side and on the demand side you are seeing more international buyers, more buyers. By the way domestic and international, but also more diversified and global buyer base for our cars. So it's both of those things working in concert that has driven selling prices up. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. And then just lastly Well just last year there I mean the total loss rates are pretty amazing and it sounds like still looking for that 79% volume growth. Do you have any data on accident frequency or what are you seeing there? Are accidents still down year-over-year and do you think some of this collision avoidance technology is yet impacting actual frequency. I think it's still too far off. Jayson Adair : We probably don't have any better data than you do. So we follow third party sources like the fast track data and so forth. And what I would say first is that for the vast majority this company's history. Accident frequency has declined slightly, steadily but very slightly over time and it's been dwarfed by of course total loss frequency on the other side of the equation. So that has driven organic unit volumes up very meaningfully over time. I do think that the rapid increases in accident frequency we saw from 2011, 2012, 2016 have tapered so accident frequency may be declining somewhat maybe flat. But it's not rising at the rate that it had previously. Total loss frequency as far as we can tell continues its upward trend. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Imbro of Stephens Inc [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One on store in Germany, I think you mentioned Jeff you guys are at twelve locations as a footprint. Is that a sufficient network to service the country today? And then how is the salvage industry in that market growing. Obviously you guys are growing rapidly taking share but is the market also growing high single digits similar to the U.S. Jayson Adair : So, as for the footprints. I think the this is this is sufficient for us to participate actively in Germany. There's no doubt in my mind that over time, as we kind of trade the market grow our platform we will invest dramatically more still in landing capacity there. So the 12 is a good spread geographically across the country. But in terms of sufficiency of capacity we are still in the very early innings of our participation in Germany. Your second question again was there? Unidentified Analyst : Just on industry growth in Germany, is it similar to the US and kind of that high single digit range? Jayson Adair : That's a tricky question to answer. So even your point about our taking shares is a very nuanced concept in the sense that we are taking share from what is a very different traditional salvage model through the listing service et cetera which I'm sure you heard and can review again from the first quarter call but in a nutshell I don't think the underlying characteristics should be different from the U.S. and the UK in the sense that the cars are relatively old across the system. So Germany is a mature economy that has had cars for a long time so the average fleet age likewise is old, in comparison by the way to developing markets or to economies that have grown tremendously in the last decade or two. China and India and like where the cars are old could be new by comparison so the cars are old. The cars are expensive for repair meaning labor costs are high, parts costs are high. Regulatory Burdens are also meaningful meaning you have to restore airbags back to tax condition to drive cars. All of those same underlying forces are similar in Germany, but for like for like salvage auctions it's just statistics in Germany we don't because they don't exist, but we are the first ones to attempt to deploy the Copart model so to speak in Germany. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Will I think you mentioned over 30% of U.S. vehicles are now going abroad and I'm assuming that some of those vehicles are going over to Europe. So can you talk about the buyer base in Germany to the extent. I would just love to hear your thoughts around over time as you develop the German market and the further EU market. Does that cannibalize any of the international demand that you're seeing at your U.S. auctions today? Jayson Adair : No, it really doesn't. Most of our international activity is in the less developed countries. Most of our cars provide affordable transportation and our top three are Mexico which is obvious because of its proximity to the United States and the next two are the UAE and to Nigeria and we're also seeing significant growth in the Caucus countries. There is some cross pollination in our buyers in Germany, but it's not significant in scope and we don't think it will have a cannibalization impact on our international activity as Germany develops. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great. And then last one from me just on capital allocation, you guys obviously chose to deploy capital towards share repo in the quarter and you funded it with some short term debt. Understanding you don't want to comment on any future activity, but has your appetite culturally to maybe carry more leverage on the business changed today given some of the scale you've seen you've gained in the recent years? Jayson Adair : No, I don't think there's been a philosophical shift so far if you go back. Just a few years even at the end of 2014 we had leverage on the balance sheet for share repurchases we consummated in the summer of 2015 and December 2015. So we had a little bit more leverage then even then we do now. But no, there's no philosophical shift in how we think about leverage. We generally prefer to be, to have meaningful financial flexibility which gives us strategic flexibility when it comes to acquiring land, pursuing international growth and so forth. So we'll continue to be a relatively low leveraged institution. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Derek Glynn of Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : Thank you for taking my question. As you think about additional growth opportunities outside of North America or Europe, China and India stand out as potentially two large markets in the long run. Can you provide an update on how you view those opportunities and whether investments have been made to expand that? Jayson Adair : I think you captured the thought well there and they are very promising markets long term for a host of reasons. That markets haven't yet materialized to nearly the same extent that they have in Europe and the United States. So we'll be there when it emerges but it's not in the next couple of years anyway. Derek Glynn : Okay, Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Jayson Adair : Thank you for coming on the call and we look forward to reporting on the next call on Q3. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter conference call for Copart. In the room today is Will Franklin, Executive Vice President, and Jeff Liaw, Chief Financial Officer. We are calling from a hotel. So, hopefully, you can hear us okay. It's kind of a little echoey.  We just finished a great week at our annual advisory board. This is a chance for us to invite our Canadian customers, our US customers and exchange ideas and information about the industry and items that Copart's working on technology and processes that we're working on. So, it's been a great week. And I think we can share some of that with you this morning, some of the facts that we've got are quite fresh since we just completed the conference. So, with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Liaw. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Jay. I'll start as always with a Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures including non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which includes adjustments to reverse the impact of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, discrete income tax items, disposals of non-operating assets, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, is relevant in assessing Copart's business strength and financial performance. We analyze our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. I'll provide brief remarks on our financial performance in the third quarter before turning it over to Will Franklin for additional context.  We achieved another record quarter in revenue, gross profit and operating income, starting with the top line. We experienced global revenue growth of 15.7% despite an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect on revenue of $7.9 million, primarily due to the relative strength of the dollar versus the pound and the Brazilian real.  Global service revenue grew at 15.3% or $62.9 million year-over-year. Purchased cars grew at a rate of 17.8%, driven principally by our increasing activity levels in Germany, but also by underlying growth in our large markets like the US and the UK. Unit sales for the company grew at 4.5% year-over-year, with US units increasing 2.8% and international units rising 13.8% versus the third quarter of 2018. Our US unit growth was driven again by both insurance and non-insurance segments. Will will describe further the underlying drivers of growth, in particular in the non-insurance space. Our global inventory grew 12.2% year-over-year in comparison to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Moving down the P&L, on gross profits, we grew 14.8% from $219 million to $251.6 million. We experienced a slight gross margin rate change from 45.8% to 45.5% for a decrease of approximately 30 basis points. This is again driven in part by a slight mix shift to purchase car volume for the reasons described a moment ago. As we talked about in prior calls as well, we also experienced lower purchase vehicle sales margins on a rate basis because as the average purchase price and sales price for our purchase vehicles rises, we expect a contraction in percentage margin. Some of the drivers for our mix shift to purchase vehicles, Germany in particular, are higher value on average and therefore can cause lower percentage margins. Overall then, turning to average selling prices \u2013 so this is literally what vehicles that Copart auctions sell for. We experienced the year-over-year increase of 10.1%. Will will also provide more context on the cars \u2013 the nature of the cars themselves as well as our efforts to continue to expand Copart's member base. Again, moving down the P&L, our general and administrative expenditures, ex stock comp and depreciation, was down slightly from $34.2 million a year ago to $34.1 million and up approximately $1 million sequentially versus the second quarter. As we say in quarters in which G&A rises or declines, generally speaking, G&A expenditures will rise over time for Copart as we experience inflation, but we continue to believe that we can achieve operating leverage given the topline growth that we have experienced. Our GAAP operating income grew from $174.6 million to $207.5 million or growth of 18.8% overcoming the currency effect of a $1.4 million decline in and of itself year-over-year relative to the third quarter. Our net interest expense was up slightly from $4 million to $5 million, given a slightly higher average net balance as we drew on our revolver late in the second quarter in connection with our Q2 stock repurchases.  We've repaid the vast majority of our over balance during the third quarter nonetheless and ended the quarter with a $7 million drawn revolver balance. Turning to taxes momentarily, our third quarter income tax rate \u2013 GAAP income tax rate of 5.6% is in part a reflection of the lower US federal tax rate we've discussed on prior calls of 21% for fiscal 2019 and beyond. You may recall that fiscal 2018 was the straddle period in which we had in months that were both pre and post the tax reform bill implemented at the end of calendar 2017. The third quarter income tax rate benefits as well from certain stock option exercises as well as discrete income tax items, related to benefits recognized as a result of amending previously filed income tax returns. The one-time benefits from those stock option exercises and discrete income tax items you'll see reflected in our non-GAAP earnings reconciliation. Our GAAP net income then increased from $127.4 million to $192.7 million or a 51% increase year-over-year. Our non-GAAP net income, we grew from $125.0 million to $154.9 million, growth of 23.9%. As I mentioned a moment ago, these adjustments include excess tax deductions for stock option exercises and related payroll taxes, discrete tax items of $10.2 million that are excluded from our non-GAAP net income. These were again generated by amendments to previously filed income tax returns. We believe that excluding these benefits from our non-GAAP earnings is an appropriate reflection of the underlying performance of the business in the current period as well as our run rate tax burden. The last note I'll mention on our international businesses. For further background in particular on Germany, we encourage you to review the transcript of our first and second quarter earnings calls where we describe in much greater detail the nature of the markets and our approach to it. We have continued our substantial progress in Germany and are investing in our future growth there as well. We've experienced more than tenfold increase in volume in Germany year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019 in comparison to the third quarter of 2018. We have continued our practice of acquiring vehicles through our listing service and selling them at our Copart's Germany auctions. Our experience continues to support our thesis generally that today's listing service model is shortchanging German insurance carriers and policyholders for that matter and that ultimately a model similar to Copart we know in other developed economies will prevail in Germany as well. We're pleased with our progress on multiple fronts, including the development of technology, our logistics processes, land and the recruitment of high-quality talent to support our operations there. Leveraging the power of Copart internationally, our German auctions have seen very strong participation, particularly with buyers outside of Germany. Excluding Germany, our international or non-US businesses continue to perform well despite currency translation headwinds. Those headwinds, of course, are most pronounced in our British and Brazilian businesses. Will Franklin will provide additional color on the underlying performance here.  Collectively, excluding Germany, our international businesses have experienced year-over-year unit growth, revenue growth, profit growth and the like. Then to the balance sheet, before I turn it to Will, cash flow for the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $238.3 million with CapEx of $122.6 million. Well over 90% of this CapEx was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts, a continuation of a theme now you've heard for several years. We also repaid $86 million of our revolving debt facility during the third quarter. We consumed $33.5 million of cash related to stock option exercises. Think of those as de facto buybacks in connection with taxes owed on the exercise of stock options. With that, I will turn it over to our EVP, Will Franklin. William Franklin : Thank you, Jeff. [indiscernible] some more insights into our third quarter performance. Our worldwide sales volume grew by 4.5% and our worldwide inventory grew by 12.2%. Hurricane volume activity was immaterial for both this quarter and the second quarter last year.  In the US, our sales volume grew by 2.8% and our inventory increased by 14.5%. Our volume growth continues to be driven by organic growth within the insurance market, market wins within the insurance market and our continued expansion into the noninsurance segments. Organic growth in the salvage market is driven, we believe, by an increase in total loss frequency. Published statistics suggest a total loss frequency of 19.9% for the first quarter of calendar 2019, an increase of 2.6% over the same quarter last year. This metric measures the percentage of estimates written that result in total losses. What is not reflected in this metric is the increase in the instances in which insurance companies salvage cars without ever writing a repair estimate. Our conversations with insurance company executives as well as the current trends and assignments lead us to believe that the growth of total loss frequency is higher than that published. Repair costs, particularly for new cars, are trending now at a rate exceeding that of inflation. An increase in the number and the average cost of replacement parts, the growth in pre and post repair scans and the supplemental damages they're identifying, the lack of capitalized repair capacity and the consolidation of the repair market by the three major MSOs are all leading to a rise in repair cost. We believe the industry is simply trending to less repairable cars. While repair costs are increasing, so too are the returns that we're generating for our sellers. The combination of our marketing efforts and efficiency of our auction platform VB3 continues to generate returns to our sellers far exceeding overall industry returns, as represented by the Manheim used car index. Compared to the same quarter last year, our ASPs are up over 10%, while the Manheim used car index is up 3.9% as worldwide demand for rebuildable cars continues to outpace the available supply. Our marketing focused on international buyers has led to a significant growth in bidding activity from those lawyers. Our full US website is translated into seven languages, with certain elements of the website translated into languages native to 135 countries. And from the US, we sell into 147 countries. In terms of volume, nearly 40% of all the units sold through our US auctions, sellers are now international buyers. Increases both year-over-year and sequentially. Because international buyers generally purchase rebuildable, and therefore higher value vehicles, they represent a still higher share of the value of the car sold at our US auctions, approaching 50%, again an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Approximately 3 out of 4 of all vehicles sold, our US website received a bid from an international buyer. We continue to grow our buyer base. While we saw a 22% increase in unique international bidders on a year-over-year basis, we also saw a 14% increase in unique domestic bidders, which we believe is remarkable growth rate for what some might consider a large and already mature buyer base. The growth in ASPs has been a primary driver in the increase in revenue per car in the US. In addition, we continue to provide more services to our insurance customers. There are certain tasks between the first notice of loss and auctioning of the salvage car that we can contribute to, but perform more efficiently because of our broad industry knowledge, our scale and our technology. The non-insurance markets continue to be a focus of our growth strategy in the US. It represented 23% of our overall US volume this quarter compared to 21% same quarter last year and 17% same quarter two years ago. These markets include franchise and independent dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, heavy equipment wholesalers. Excluding the charity market in the US, our non-insurance volume grew by 18% and 93% over the same quarter of last year and the same quarter two years ago respectively.  The growth in volume was spread broadly across multiple seller segments. Volume from dealers was up 14%; wholesalers, 39%; rental car companies, 79%; and fleets and industrial equipment, 7%. We attribute this growth to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and the growth in returns generated for these segments. Turning to our international operation, the performance of the UK and Canada remain relatively consistent with the same quarter last year in terms of volume, revenue and EBIT after adjusting for currency fluctuations. In Brazil, however, we continue to see meaningful growth as the value we offer in terms of technology, process and land has allowed us to expand our market share in that country. In Brazil, our volume and local currency revenue and EBIT grew by 43%, 55% and 61% respectively. This is remarkable growth considering the declining number of auto insurance policies written due to the economic conditions in that country. Additionally, in Brazil, like the US, we are growing our non-insurance business, which represented 9.8% of the total volumes sold compared to 3.6% in the same quarter last year. Jeff has already provided commentary on Germany. Our other operations outside of the Americas, the UK and Germany, for the quarter remain immaterial in both revenue and EBIT. In the US and globally, we're seeing rising labor, health insurance and [indiscernible] costs, all of which have led to an increase in our average cost to process each car. Year-over-year, our US inventory was up 14.5%, which is significantly higher than the growth in sales volume of 2.8%. We attribute the difference to an unusually mild weather that affected assignments at the beginning of the quarter. However, assignments after the first month of the quarter have been and continue to be robust. The year-over-year growth in our US inventory over the last 16 quarters has averaged over 12%, and we expect this trend to continue. To accommodate this growth and to provide standalone capacity along the Gulf of Mexico and the East Coast, we continue our land expansion activities. Since the last earnings call, we have announced the opening of four new facilities, three new Copart facilities in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Greenville, Kentucky and West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and one new NPA facility in Sacramento, California. In addition, we have expanding existing facilities in Atlanta, Chicago, Austin and Newburgh, New York. In total, these three new Copart yards and four yard expansions have added over 150 acres of storage capacity. So far this year, we have announced 22 new facilities, 12 in the US, 1 each in Brazil and Canada, and 8 in Germany, as well as 10 yard expansions in the US. Currently, in the US and Canada, we have over 21 new yard and yard expansion projects in the construction phase and 33 projects in the engineering phase. These projects alone represent thousands of acres of capacity and will consume hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. That concludes my comments. We'll now proceed to the Q&A session of this call. Jayson Adair : Operator, you could open it up for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick : Good morning. And congratulations on a nice quarter. Jayson Adair : Thanks a lot, Bob. Robert Labick : So, thanks for some of that color. I wanted to follow-up on Will's comments on the international buyer base first. You may or may not have this with you, but I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of where that was, sort of the percentage of sales for that base three or five years ago, would be one part of the question. And then, the second part, which is probably more important anyway, is talk about some of the drivers that have changed in the US just in the salvage market that have led to more international buyers getting into this market? William Franklin : Got it. Much appreciate your question, Bob. And this is actually a topic we addressed and discussed at some length with our customers this week. As for the underlying drivers of that shift over time, I think there are two major ones worth mentioning. The first is that, of course, we're observing higher economic growth in a lot of countries outside the huge developed economies, like the US and the UK. And, therefore, there is just more natural demand for vehicles, including rebuildable cars coming from Copart auctions. The second is the nature of total loss frequency. I think you've been following the industry for a long time, Bob. So, you know that even what was a 50% damaged car 20 years ago looks very different from one today because the cars today are much more easily rebuilt. Some of the damage may be technological modules that could be fixed more simply in places outside the US. So, that's been the 30, 40-year trend really starting with airbags many years ago and more recently with the arrival of newer technologies in the cars as well. So, a combination of growing economic activity and, therefore, demand for cars in these countries with higher economic growth, but much lower vehicle penetration, number one. And number two, the changing nature of the cars as well. As I told more easily, the cars have value not just as dismantled parts \u2013 that's probably one fundamental misunderstanding of this business, is to assume that the cars really go only to dismantlers. Over time, they are increasingly going to rebuilder, many of them international in nature. Jayson Adair : Let me add one more element to that growth, and that is that cars rebuilt in foreign markets are generally not held to the same standards as cars that are rebuilt in domestic markets. For example, the car in Eastern Europe may or may not have the airbags replaced at all. So, that gives them an advantage in terms of lowering the cost of converting that car to a drivable vehicle. Robert Labick : Okay, great. That's super color. Thank you. And then, just kind of sticking with the trend of technology going into cars, the centers, et cetera, and what you've talked about over several calls that younger and less damaged cars are being totaled, just wondering if you could give us a sense of where you believe we are in that process. And is this early innings, middle, late? Where do you think the trend to more younger and less damaged cars being totaled stands? William Franklin : I think as a general matter, Bob, the nature of total loss frequency is big and slow moving, in the sense that it reflects the installed base of cars in the growth. Right? So, our business principally serves those cars that are literally being driven or the insurance carriers, of course, who insure them. And, therefore, there aren't step function changes in any given month or quarter or year. We're talking about 250 million, 300 million cars in the road, registered vehicles in the United States, for example. So, I don't think those are spiky sudden changes. I think it's a gradual change that has generally been a favorable one for decades now. As for the precise age of the fleet and the precise age of vehicles that are involved in accidents and therefore totaled, I don't think we expect dramatic changes. But, collectively, the changes will ultimately be favorable to total loss frequency. Robert Labick : Got it. Great. And then, one last quick one, if I could. Just on Germany, I know you went on about it quickly. The tenfold increase in volumes was tremendous. But could you just give us a sense of the feedback you're getting from the insurers right now as to what's holding them out from switching to the Copart model, if there is any specific things that still need to be worked on or addressed? Or if they just need a year or two of data? Or what do you think is the kind of, I guess, last or hopefully near the end of impediments towards switching over to the Copart model? Jayson Adair : Sure. It's a great question. Right now, Bob, what we're focused on for this fiscal year was getting the network built. So, we've got the network of facilities in place. We've got the trucks now, the carriers in place to tow vehicles. And I would say the best way I can explain is we're pressure-testing the team now. We're achieving the results that we have in the UK, that we have in the US, that we have in Brazil where a vehicle can be assigned and picked up in sometimes hours, but within a day or two as opposed to a longer period of time. So, we're getting all of the operational performance in place and we do have a couple of accounts already, but we are not going out and hitting \u2013 swinging big or swinging for the fences with some very large carriers until we've got everything working the way it should. So, it's a process of building the team, the network, pressure testing. And then, this year, we will be going out and speaking with some carriers about switching over to the model. But we want to have everything working perfectly before we do that. You get really one shot at success. Robert Labick : That's great. Okay. Thanks so much. William Franklin : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Continue to be really impressed with the non-insurance business that you guys are putting up. When I first started covering the company, I used to think non-insurance business was all about charity and, clearly, it's not anymore. And I was just hoping you guys could talk a little bit about what's the value proposition or what's the message that you're sending and allowing you to win that share from dealers? And even more specifically, the growth that you cited in the rental car industry is really interesting. Curious to know, how you are getting that business and kind of how you're convincing some of these fairly decent size consigners to work with you? Jayson Adair : So, thanks for your question, John. I think, in short, it's not particularly about messages or marketing. It's just fundamentally about returns. So, we offer a buyer base, including large quantities of international active buyers of rebuildable and drivable vehicles. And so, it's really the net auction results that we can deliver to the non-insurance segment. And I think you're mentioning dealers in particular that has proven to be persuasive. So, it's not particularly any silver-toned communications on our part. It's really just that we demonstrate week after week and month after month that we can generate better returns for them on their vehicles and to do so quickly with the logistics and the infrastructure to deliver those outcomes . William Franklin : Let me just add a couple of comments there. Our returns, obviously, are a huge part of our ability to be successful in that market. I think another thing that we don't ignore is the operational aspects and the ability to eliminate any friction to send us these cars. So, every one of these segments is significantly different. Charity cars completely different than a [indiscernible] equivalent which is completely different than a car coming from a franchise or independent dealership. And each of them have their own operating systems. So, to the extent that we can integrate our operations into their systems, to the extent that we need to change our process, to accommodate their specific needs, it makes it more likely that they will be testing us on their volume. And the results of the tests have been such that they continue to increase the volume that they send to us. John Healy : Great. And then, just wanted to ask about the real estate investment. I think, last call, you guys noted 45 or 46 projects kind of underway. And you thought maybe 24 months to kind of tie that up. Any updated thoughts on the real estate investment? Do you expect to do more than that or you're ahead of pace there? Just kind of how you're thinking about that investment. William Franklin : Yeah. There is no [ph] slowing down our expansion with \u2013 we project out five years in terms of volume needs. And the reason we project out so far is because the gestation period for some of these new properties can be two or three years very easily, especially in these expensive markets. And so, our activity, I don't see decelerating at any point in the next two or three years. John Healy : Great. And, I guess, I'm going to hook in on that five-year forecast that you just kind of mentioned there, Will. When you kind of are building out that five-year forecast for your needs in terms of real estate, obviously, it's going to correlate to the volume and the capacity. So, when you look at those forecast, are the forecasts meaningfully different than the volume numbers globally that you're seeing today? So, I know you guys don't have long-term growth targets. But as you think about those needs and what you're buying forward, does the year-in, year-out kind of movement look a lot like what you've put up the last few quarters or do you guys think the growth in the market accelerates or decelerates thus far in your business? William Franklin : So, I'm not really motivated to share our exact projection numbers. I can tell you this, though. We have a couple of absolutes in our [indiscernible]. One is the auctions have to run every day. And our auctions do. Our KCLO [ph] on our auction sites is three or four, five 9s [ph]. The other absolute is land. We have to have land. So, we really can't risk under-projecting our land needs going forward. And so, once again, we are very aggressive in our pursuit of the land capacity to accommodate the growth that we're anticipating. John Healy : Understood. Thank you, guys. And congrats. William Franklin : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi. Good morning. My first question is just a clarification. And I apologize if I missed it. Did you give the revenue per unit that you saw during the quarter? I don't know. Both in the US or internationally or in total? William Franklin : No. We don't always provide that metric. We did talk about a couple of the levers that are driving up that revenue per car, primarily our higher ASPs and, secondarily, the increase in services that we're providing to our sellers and our buyers. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. And then, you talked about this kind of in your opening remarks in terms of the congress you've had in the last week and some of the \u2013 maybe the technology investments that you're looking at or potential investments. But maybe you could speak a little bit more about the technology side of your business and what can be done as we move forward? Thanks. William Franklin : Sure. So, the selling process that the insurance companies go through sounds very simple. But in reality, it's fairly complex. You have a lot of constituents in that whole process. You've got the insurance company. You've got the policyholder. You're going to need an appraisal and repair estimate, both of which can be provided by different people. You can have a lean payoff. You're dealing with the DMV. And all these activities and transfer of information need to be coordinated and sequenced in the right order. And we work with virtually every insurance company in the United States. And so, we're able to identify best practices and developed the technology around those best practices and offer that technology and those best practices to all the insurance companies. And generally, smaller insurance companies will take advantage of it. The large ones will too.  So, to answer your question, we generating the technology that allows us to integrate the flow of information, the flow of documents, the flow of the process around our total loss process. Jayson Adair : Stephanie, the only thing I'd add there is, when I think about technology, Copart kind of framework for it, I'd say think of it in three pieces. The first is the importance of technology in helping our customers perform better and faster from their side. And that's the integration that we all talked about, providing data at the right time to better enable their own decision-making processes. Second aspect of technology for us is to help us perform better. So, we have different applications, different technologies, for example, that help us manage our towing network better, to dispatch trucks more efficiently. And then, thirdly, of course, technology enhances our own reliability. You heard Will talk about investing for KCLO, which in our parlance is to keep the lights on, an auction reliability. And so, a good part of our technology investment as well is to prepare us for the growth that we are serving to make sure that we can continue to serve our customers. well. Stephanie Benjamin : That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Steph. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Craig Kennison : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start on the insurance side with RFPs. I know, in the past five years or so, you've landed a handful of very large national contracts with insurers. With that in mind, has the trend stabilized? Are there any upcoming renewals or RFPs with new prospects? And then, additionally, what's the dynamic in Germany? And are there any big RFPs that would be a national contract there? Jayson Adair : Got it. Craig, thanks for the question. As to your first question, we're not like a subscription business that has a bunch of customers coming due upon their contract expiration at the same time. Our dialog with our customers is literally on a daily basis. So, no, there is not a particularly lumpy either opportunity or risk for us to win or lose a big chunk of business simply by the nature of contract expiration in and itself. That said, we think all of what you've heard today about our auction platform, the returns we generate, technology, et cetera, generally enables us to win market share over time, which we have done now for decades and believe we will continue in the future as well. As for Germany, the issue isn't principally RFPs as someone posed a question earlier. It's principally about changing the way business is done altogether by the German insurance carriers. So, it's a shift in a way they think not a contract expiration per se or an RFP that \u2013 it triggers the opportunity for us. Copart certainly is a well-known enough and, obviously, a very successful enterprise in salvage auctions around the world generally. So, those dialogs are available to us when we are ready and when they're ready for them, but it's not per se an RFP. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then, Will, I had a question for you on real estate and hoping you can share some metrics to frame that spend, but maybe what are the economics of the typical real estate project, either the average cost of an acre or the range you might pay depending upon the market? What kind of capacity do you get in terms of car volume on a project like that? And then, what's the path to breakeven or to corporate average returns on that investment? Anything you can shed light on would be helpful. William Franklin : Sure. Let me start by saying there is no typical transaction. So, we can buy land for $50,000 an acre in some parts of the country. We just bid on land an equivalent over $3 million an acre and didn't get into the second round of the bidding for that land.  Continuing on some of your questions, you can't look at the economic output from one yard because we don't service one insurance company in one yard. We service insurance companies nationwide. So, you can't really ignore these very expensive markets because they may not be as economically profitable as the less expensive real estate markets. So, that's really not even a consideration for us. We just know that we have to have the land whenever insurance companies need it. Jayson Adair : Craig, even to put it in financial terms, I think if you took snapshots at any moment in Copart's history and said, does this next parcel of land generate an ROI in the form of its cap rate that exceeds Copart's weighted average cost of capital, the answer is almost certainly no. But if you had the benefit of a time machine, if you go back to the early 1990s and decide Copart, whether we should buy land or not, now that we have the benefit obviously of hindsight, having acquired massive parcels of real estate in the United States and the United Kingdom and elsewhere around the globe, is one of the key economic enablers of our business. It's proven to be incredibly strategically valuable. We believe that will be true going forward as well. So, as Will noted, it's not about the cap rate on any given parcel of land. It's about building the network that allows you then to amass a global liquid market of buyers as well. So, it's a two-sided auction and owning our land has been a critical enabler of that two-sided auction. Craig Kennison : That is super helpful. And maybe just to follow-up, Will, with your point on the property where you didn't make the second round. What is the consequence of that? Does that mean longer towing distances or higher costs? What is your backup plan given you need to service customers in that market? William Franklin : Well, there's a number of ways to approach markets like that. Typically, we like to have one large yard. In certain situations, we'll settle for multiple smaller sites. We'll also look at trucking and we'll do that tracking in a manner that is not negatively impactful to our sellers. For example, a truck in the evening. We can operationally address some of the yard constraints by taking older inventory and moving it off site. There is ways around it. But, ultimately, land will continue to become more expensive and the development costs will become more expensive as well. Jayson Adair : And, Craig, let me add to that. Will talks about a five-year plan. We get bumped on land all the time. That example he gave you is just another example of land that we've tried to buy, we couldn't buy and there will be another piece of land we can buy, but we can't get zoning. Because we're working on this five years out, we're not out of capacity. We've got room and we can service customers. And, specifically, in the market he's talking about, we've got plenty of room and we can service customers, but we've eventually got to get land in that market. And if we didn't, then we would do some of the things that Will just spoke about. Craig Kennison : Great, thank you. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Incorporated. Daniel Imbro : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on a comment you made on ASP strength and the growing number of bidders in the US despite it being a more mature market. I think, in recent quarters, you've noted that you've increased your international marketing to bring more international bidders to auction, but are there any initiatives you can point to that you guys are doing to help bring domestic buyers to auction? Or what do you attribute that strength in bidders to? William Franklin : Yes. We have specific initiatives for both domestic and international buyers. We work with buyer profiles. And through our marketing efforts, whether they are social or PPC or SEO, we're targeting those buyers to make more aware of car auction and particularly the cars that are available. So, when we introduce or we go into a new segment that may not be a familiar segment to our existing buyer base, we'll spend an extra amount of time and resources to identify that segment and to those particular buyers. And Jay just handed me some of my call notes. Obviously, we've been successful. We've increased our unique bidders on the domestic side by 14%. And I'd say that's 14% over very large volume numbers. International is more segmented because it's country by country. So, two of the countries that are growing are Georgia and Jordan. And Georgia, for whatever reason, they're buying electric cars. So, Teslas and Priuses are finding their way to Georgia at very, very high ASPs. And so, we are obviously promoting that. And in China, they're buying Harley-Davidsons. In Mexico, they're buying pickup trucks. In the Netherlands, they are buying sports cars. So, we're getting to know the demand in these particular regions. In Nigeria, they just want affordable transportation and our marketing efforts reflect that knowledge that we're gaining. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's really helpful color. Jeff, switching gears a little bit, looking at the revenue growth in the quarter, kind of the implied, revenue per unit remaining strong, especially considering the scrap steel headwinds that we saw during the quarter. Can you maybe just give us a reminder on how scrap steel impacts your business and your ASPs? I feel like a few years ago, it felt like a bigger driver of ARPU, but has anything changed or can you just give us a refresher on how that impacts your business? Jeffrey Liaw : That's a great question. And I think the answer is a strong yes that the nature of scrap and its influence on our business has shrunken over time. It's declined very meaningfully. And it's the flip side of the coin of the issue we talked about a few moments ago that a car \u2013 imagine a car has a spectrum of potential values. And at the very low end, it is literally worth its waste in steel and its metal content. And at the other very \u2013 the other extreme end of the spectrum, it's a drivable car the next day. A perfectly intact automobile. As the nature of technology and the increasing complexity of cars has made more the totals \u2013 more the total cars at the end of this \u2013 closer to the end of the spectrum of drivable cars, they're more rebuildable, they're more drivable. They're certainly worth more as parts than they are as the metal. And, therefore, scrap is not something, by the way, operationally, we particularly focus on day to day at all. It's really about finding the right buyers of cars and the high value \u2013 the higher value cars for us assuredly are not being sold for scrap. The international buyers are, obviously, not shipping a car several thousand miles to melt it down. So, scrap matters, but increasingly less over time. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. So, yeah, we should change how we're thinking about it. That's helpful. And then, maybe last one. Internationally, we've touched a lot on Germany, but looking \u2013 it looks like you're growing \u2013 scaling your offering in Spain pretty nicely, although it's still pretty small. Can you update us on how you're thinking about that opportunity? Or any kind of feedback or learning on that market as we think about what's next beyond Germany in Europe? Thanks. Jayson Adair : Sure. So, we implemented a new playbook, if you will, in Germany to build the network out. And we're letting the team in Europe basically take that playbook and implement it in Spain. So, they've added locations. And they're, in many ways, mimicking what we're doing in Germany to achieve their own success. There is focus in both markets, but, clearly, we're putting the vast majority of our efforts right now into Germany to get that market to see a big win in terms of volume and a switch over. This has been a continued investment in the market in terms of people, process, technology, land, et cetera. And once we start to see that transition over, it will be even further growth into expanding locations. Will's example of the US for land is what we're doing right now in Germany. We've got a dozen sites we're looking at. And we're trying to purchase and then we'll develop those sites. So, the ability to build that network and to achieve success takes time. And so, Spain is doing the exact same thing. They're much smaller weight than Germany, but nonetheless doing the exact same thing in that market and they are seeing success. So, we're excited about that. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Best of luck. Jayson Adair : Thank you. William Franklin : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi. This is Chris Bottiglieri. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one was, did I hear correctly that international buyers are 40% of units, but 50% of revenue? William Franklin : 40% of units. It's 50% of the value of everything that we auction. And that's because we're buying the rebuildable cars and not the cars that are being parted out. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That makes sense. And can I \u2013 as a rule of thumb, that would suggest that the selling price of those cars is 25% higher than the non-international bidders. So, would it be fair to kind of use that as a rule of thumb for the impact on ARPU growth, the 25% premium as international mix grows? Jeffrey Liaw : I've got to validate that precise arithmetic, but, directionally, yes. They are buying meaningfully higher value cars on average, in part because of that scrap phenomenon you heard a few moments ago. But the very low end cars, of course, none of them go internationally. Many of the high-end cars do. Daniel Imbro : Got you. That's what I figured. Okay. And the next question I had was, can you \u2013 I don't think you've talked about this a lot recently. But can you talk about, kind of within the US, the mix of fees excluding purchase vehicles? That just makes the math fuzzy. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of revenue is fee-based versus ancillary service based and kind of like \u2013 to what extent that's contributed to ARPU growth in the last couple of years? Jayson Adair : I think, Chris, on fee schedule, we tend not to discuss them in any substance. I think we have delivered additional services. You heard Will talk about a few of them, including our title procurement services, loan pay-off amounts and so forth. But our fee schedules are competitive and sensitive matters for us. We deliver, we believe, very strong value to both our sellers and buyers. Daniel Imbro : Got you. Okay. And then, just a quick question on rent expense, that's doubled over the past years. I was wondering if this is driven entirely by international expansion or you've had a change in philosophy on like rent versus own or cap rates or whatnot. And is there a way to bifurcate the rent expense between the US and international business for us? Thank you. Jeffrey Liaw : You were posing the question about the lease versus own decision on real estate? Daniel Imbro : Yeah. If you look at the facilities rent expense, for the company, it's doubled over the last two years. Just trying to figure out what's driving that? Is it all international? Or is it something else going on that's driving that like doubling of rent expense? Jeffrey Liaw : I would think of rent expense a little bit like purchased cars for Copart. It's a number that you'll see and, therefore \u2013 and we've reported publicly and, therefore, it draws attention. But, in practice, we buy what we can. So, we buy anything we can and we lease when it's operationally necessary. When we enter a particular market, when we are adding capacity to a metro area in our existing markets, our expectation is that we're there for decades, and so we're always better off buying. There are some circumstances in which the land that's available can't be bought and, therefore, have to be leased. There are some circumstances, for example, in Germany, as you mentioned a moment ago, in which our desire to be up and running very quickly can help us to pursue actionable properties, in some cases, or in many cases, lease properties instead of purchasing them. But our preference fundamentally in almost every case would be to buy, not to lease. And any additional rental properties are by necessity, not by desire. Daniel Imbro : Got you. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone . At this time, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Adair. Jayson Adair : Thanks so much. We appreciate you all attending the call and we look forward to reporting on the end of the year and the fourth quarter on the next call. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Copart. Before I start, I will turn it over to Jeff Liaw for opening remarks and then I'll give you some commentary, turn it back to Jeff for an update and then we'll open it up for Q&A. With that let me turn over to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw : Perfect. Thanks, Jay. I'll start with our Safe Harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted common share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of the impact of income taxes on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, net of deferred tax charges, certain discrete income tax items, disposals of non-operating assets, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related fees and integration charges, reserves for legacy sales tax liabilities, foreign currency related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart's business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time-to-time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. Now, I'll turn our attention to the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 for Copart. We are pleased with our results in booking a record fourth quarter in revenue, gross profit and operating income. Our global worldwide revenue grew 20.8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter despite unfavorable currency effects of $3.9 million or thereabouts from foreign operations, primarily due to strength in the US dollar versus the pound. Our US revenue grew at 21%, international revenue grew at 20%. Global service revenue and purchased car revenue were similar for the quarter with global service revenue growing at 20.1% and purchased car revenue growing at 25.4%, slightly outpacing service revenue. On unit sales, we grew worldwide 7.1% year-over-year with US unit growth of 7.3% and international unit growth [Technical Difficulty] United States our growth is driven both by our insurance customers as well as our non-insurance customers. On the matter of organic growth within the insurance world, we believe the long-term trends in favor of rising total loss frequency continues. Repairing vehicles is becoming relatively less attractive with repair costs rising from vehicle complexity and labor inflation, while at the same time totaling vehicles is becoming relatively more attractive with more buyers for these damaged cars and rising selling prices as a result [indiscernible] few minutes. We also continue to grow our non-insurance business as well. Non-insurance volume represents north of 24% of our total US volume sold. In that non-insurance segments, we generally include franchise and independent auto dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. We attribute growth in non-insurance to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and of course our auction liquidity and returns most of all. We grew global inventory for the quarter at 18.4%, with US inventory growing 19.8% and international inventory growing 9.8%. Inventory growth was driven by factors, similar to the ones that I described a moment ago for units trends. We grew gross profit from $188.4 million to $242.6 million or approximately 29% increase year-over-year. Our gross margin rate increased from 41.9% to 44.7%, an increase of 280 basis points. This is partially attributable to lapping elevated depreciation from a year ago and also partially attributable to rising average selling prices for our vehicles. International gross margins declined slightly from 28.9% to 25.5%, largely attributable to purchased car activity in Germany. I'll turn now to average selling prices within the United States for Copart auctions, which rose 8.1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. This has been a continuation of a trend now for years, a reflection in our business of more bidders -- more international bidders and therefore improved auction liquidity as well as increasing mix of newer less damaged cars. International bidding and buying activity are in turn the reflection of our proactive marketing efforts as well as the effectiveness of our all digital auction platform VB3. The outcome is have more bids per unit and therefore superior selling prices for our customers as well. And in fact our ASPs continue to outpace meaningfully the various used car indices, such as the Manheim Used Car Price Index. As you know, rising ASPs of course then cycles back to our unit growth drivers as well with repair cost rising, but the proceeds for total loss units increasing at the same time, the total loss path becomes relatively more compelling economically. I'll turn now to our general and administrative expenditures, ex-stock comp and depreciation, G&A is down from $42.8 million a year ago to $39.8 million for the quarter. As we say almost every quarter, our G&A expenditures will fluctuate and they will generally grow over time, but we continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage, given the top line growth we've experienced. As with all trended data in our business gross margins, G&A unit sales inventory changes etc., we encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than single quarter metrics for a more accurate view of the business. Our GAAP operating income grew from $134.8 million to $192.8, or 43% year-over-year. This is despite currency effect of a negative $1.1 million in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018. Well note again that in operating income this increase reflects in part the elevated depreciation levels from a year ago. Our net interest expense was nearly flat, up from $4 million to $4.3 million, primarily due to less interest income from lower cash balances at year-end, the product in parts of our share buybacks over the course of the year. Other expense of $1.5 million was largely attributable to non-recurring losses from our share of an equity method investment. Then on taxes, our fourth quarter income tax rate of 17.9% is a reflection of a lower US federal tax rate. As we've discussed on prior calls of 21% or thereabouts, as well as onetime benefits from stock option exercises and discrete income tax items. The onetime benefit from those stock option exercises has been reflected in our non-GAAP reconciliation, which is included in our earnings release. GAAP net income then increased from $109.7 million a year ago in the fourth quarter to $153.5 million this year or an increase of approximately 40%. Our non-GAAP net income increased from [indiscernible] or growth of 39% is again adjusted for certain excess tax deductions for stock option exercises and related payroll taxes, as well as certain legacy sales tax liability reserves. Finally, on the balance sheet and cash flow, before I turn it back to Jay. We finished the quarter with $186.3 million in cash on our books and a little north of $200 million in net debt. We generated operating cash flow for the quarter of $193 million with capex of $114.5 million, more than 90% of which was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts. We continue our efforts to invest in land, to purchase and develop lands to meet both current and prospective demand for our services. With that, I'll turn it back to Jay. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning again. In this quarter, not only is the fourth quarter for fiscal 2019, but it is the last quarter of the decade and a quarter that is a milestone being 25 years since we went public. Copart went public on March 17, 1994 and I literally remember it like yesterday going into New York City for the first time. We crisscrossed back and forth bidding with investors, pitching Copart and two weeks later we were in the World Trade Center building, must have been up about 104. I know it was the highest I've ever been in the building, and I know it was the highest I'd ever felt in my life is a pretty incredible time. And they were yelling Copart on the floor, people were screaming the name out and screening a lot of other things that you wouldn't do today, times have changed a lot, but it was one of the most memorable and emotional experiences I ever had in my life. We were set. That's how I look at it. Copart now is public. We paid off our debt. We have currency to go buy companies and we IPO'ed that day at $0.50 a share. We closed that day up about 15% based on my memory, which was quite a pop in the stock. So it's quite a bit of demand for the Company. And we closed the year 25 years ago, yes, I had to look it up, because that's one thing I don't remember. We closed the year with revenues of $22.8 million as a Company and operating income for the year of $4.1 million. And we set off and we grew and we've bought companies and we've built a network and in 1996 we reserve this thing called copart.com and we weren't really sure what the Internet was, but we thought it was pretty cool. And we, from that point on, really focused on all the things we can do at Copart and Copart.com. In 1998, we launched Internet bidding. It was the first of its kind. Willis and I were in San Francisco at an auction called Butterfield and Butterfield, and we saw people sitting at a desk on the phone, raising their hand and bidding against the live auction there. And we had seen that in our business with contract buyers, but in this case, these people were on the phone with the actual end buyer's and that's really where the idea came from and we thought why couldn't we allow people to submit bids over the Internet and then we will wrap those bids at auction. It hadn't been done in the whole car world, it hadn't been done in the salvage world. It was a brand new concept. We rolled it out in August of 1998 and from March of 1994 to August of '98, the stock has tripled and we are pretty proud of our success in terms of what the Company has done in terms of growth and in terms of what we've seen in our stock price, but we really wanted to innovate. We wanted to change the way the cars were sold. In those days, it was 100% live auction. And so now we are introducing this Internet experience, but you really had to physically be at the auction to see the car and then submit the bid online. So in 1999, we started putting images online and that was another first for the industry and we've chose five. I'd like to tell you there was some kind of thought process behind it, but there is four corners on the car and an interior shot and that was it. So we put five images of every vehicle online and continued thinking about ways to improve the experience for our customers. By 2003 and clearly, we were ahead of our time in terms of really pushing towards a digital platform and towards an online platform. But by 2003, we rolled out and tested our virtual bidding technology and it was June 23, 2003 in Bakersfield, California. We chose Bakersfield because it was a smallest store [ph] we had in the Company and we're going to test it, but test it in a small environment and see how it does or said it out, and what we saw in that sale is the strongest returns out of the whole year, it's a biweekly auction. So it's probably about 12 or 13 auctions so far that year and it was the highest return, we've ever seen as a Company in that location. So we had to roll another sight, we chose Syracuse, New York because it's on the other side of the country, because it was also small site and it was a completely different experience and we saw the exact same results. Within six months Copart would roll the whole Company to virtual bidding technology to VB2. It was our second generation of virtual bidding technology, hence the name. And from there we would see returns just continue to increase and they would increase -- and they would increase all the way to 2008. And anybody who lived through 2008 in the business world knows what happened next. And so after the financial crisis, Copart had a decision. What do we want to do and we chose to double down. We double down on our expansions going international, expanding into the UK and eventually Germany and Spain and Brazil and the Middle East, Canada and another -- a number of other locations that we went into or that we opened up internationally. And then we also doubled down on our marketing efforts and this was really the first time the Copart had taken an aggressive marketing stance. We started with NASCAR, with NHRA and with television SPEED Channel and ESPN2 and a number of other methods. That would evolve from that point on into a massive social media platform that we dominate today, whether it's Twitter, Facebook, YouTube. There are a number of channels where people have over 1 million followers and they talk about nothing, but Copart on their channel, buying cars, fixing cars and how they love to do business and to work with Copart, buying cars at Copart and bill [ph] cars we sell them. While this was happening, technology started to go into cars at a rapid rate. The interesting thing about 2019 is today, you can buy Kia that has everything from lane assist, adaptive cruise, adaptive headlights, every single thing you'd expect on the Mercedes-Benz, except the interesting part is back in 2009 none of those things existed on Mercedes-Benz. So what we saw over the last 10 years is where the top car that you could buy in American had none of that technology and average car in America is standard with that type of technology. We saw that trend starting about five years ago and we kicked off a program called 2020. This allowed us to expand our network, expand our locations and start to get really prepared for the volume that we knew was going to be coming in. Many of you followed the Company for a long time know that we also doubled down by acquiring a bunch of the Company back doing stock repurchases, but to me what's more important is how we operated the business. We focused on the marketing efforts to build ultimate demand for the product we're selling, to have room for all the vehicles through our expansive network of locations. And if you combine those two, you achieve record ASPs, achieve record volumes, achieve -- you achieve record successes. So I'm very excited about what has happened in the last 25 years. How could I not be. For a kid that went to New York City for the first time and looked up, I couldn't believe it. I just could not believe -- couldn't believe what I saw, it was that incredible. I have never been emotional, but it was a really, really incredible experience and to be sitting here today and looking at the Company, this has gone from just over $20 billion a year in revenue -- $20 million a year in revenue to a Company that has broke to $2 billion revenue number, it's damn impressive. We have over 7,000 people that make up Copart. They were led by the best people in the world at what they do. The team that we have built over the last 25 years are amazing. That's why we've seen the kind of results we've seen. I've never seen Copart -- in all my years never seen Copart in a better position, in a better opportunity to seize the future. With Will Franklin at my side and Jeff Liaw, as our President and with the rest of the team in the 7,000 people that make up Copart, I'm enormously excited. I can't say that I'm enormously excited about what we're going to do in 2020, but I'm enormously excited about what we're going to do for the next 10 years. I was going to speak first, but Jeff was on a roll. So, I was going to turn it over to our new President. But now, I'll turn it over to questions. So with that Jonathan, if you'd open it up for questions that would be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bob Labick of CJS Securities. Robert Labick : Good morning of Bob Labick from CJS. First congratulations to Jay to you and to Copart on 25 great years and then congratulations to Jeff and to Will on their new roles as well. Jayson Adair : Thank you, Bob. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you, Bob. Robert Labick : Excited for you guys. So one question I wanted to start with, you've said for several quarters and mentioned it -- I think you mentioned it today Jeff. I'm not 100% sure, what you've been saying it for several quarters that you've been winning share in the US, and I just was hoping you could discuss what's going on? What are you doing differently to gain the share? What are your key selling points with customers and how do you continue to show this strong growth in share gain? Jeffrey Liaw : A good question, Bob. And I think we generally don't comment on individual accounts. But if you look at multiple quarters, multiple years really, I think it becomes self-evident that we have grown faster than the industry overall and the reasons we think are many folds. A handful that I'll describe here, but certainly auction returns, the economic proposition we offer is first and foremost, you heard us both talk about our technology platform, member recruitment equivalent marketing and so forth, which drives superlative auction results, which ultimately drives unit volumes and account wins in our favor. We, as you know from prior calls pride ourselves on security and service as well, both in the ordinary course of business. There are a number of details that I want to drag you through, but when we talk about operational performance with our customers what that means, I think is in many fold experience with Copart and then of course we also take pride in our superior service in catastrophic events as well. So depending on where you are in storm cycles, economic cycles, etc., certainly, different customers have different priorities, but we work day and night to deliver excellent results on all those dimensions. Robert Labick : Got it, great. And then on the ASP side you've had obviously terrific results. I was hoping maybe you could break it down a little bit. Is it, both in terms of the insurance ASPs and non-insurance growing, or is it just a mix towards non-insurance? And if it's both are growing within insurance is it like-for-like growth, meaning if you have like a 10-year-old car with 150,000 miles, this year, are you getting a higher ASP than you did a year ago? Just any color on the ASP growth would be great? Jeffrey Liaw : To answer your question technically is difficult because there is no -- it is not like for like right, meaning a 10-year-old car today is not the same as a 10-year-old car a year ago and that's one of the drivers thought change. But, yes what we're describing is not just mix shift from insurance to non-insurance. It is also like for like increases and the selling prices of insurance vehicles. So I think the answer to your question is yes, they are both increases in the 10-year-old car as well as an increasing mix of newer cars within the insurance world as well. Robert Labick : Got it. Great, thank you. And then last one quickly, I think last quarter we talked about Germany and building out the distribution kind of network within the country before flipping insurance companies. Can you talk about your latest thoughts and hurdles to getting that market to Copart style? Jeffrey Liaw : Certainly, I think we have continued to invest in Germany. We've experienced strong growth in both our traditional listing service business, as well as the Copart style -- Copart model auctions that we're running in Germany. We continue to invest in land member recruitment, seller sales efforts and so forth. So the progress continues there. We continue to believe the economic proposition is compelling [Technical Difficulty] Bob, where we got into retail, I think the story is still very much holds from there. Robert Labick : Congratulations again on all of the things we've just discussed and thank you. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Bob. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Kennison of Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And again congratulations on all those fronts. I wanted to ask about hurricane Dorian and in general, you're hurricane preparation this season. What have you done to prepare for Dorian and as that moves up the coast and maybe doesn't track towards Florida, but threatens other states? How has your response evolved? Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Copart started on getting experience. I would say in super storms back in 2005. Sure, we dealt with storms prior to that, but 2005 is really the eye opener. Following that would be Sandy and Harvey. And today, we've got an amazing team that is just dedicated to cat. We got land dedicated to cat and we've got equipment dedicated to cat. So I can get into all the details when we just say that's we're prepared and we're ready across the Eastern seaboard. So whether the hurricane was going to impact Miami or whether it's going to impact New York, we've got the people, the equipment and the land in place and ready to go to serve our customers. So we're good. Craig Kennison : Good, and thank you. And I'm assuming you have no exposure to the Bahamas? Jeffrey Liaw : No, none. Craig Kennison : Okay. And then, Jay, maybe in the spirit of long-term thinking, based on your comments, could you just talk about the sharing economy and what that means for Copart? You've got potentially a major shift in car ownership from individuals to fleets. How do you think that plays out for Copart and was that a big trend? Are you looking towards other big trends as you look at the next quarter century? Jayson Adair : Well, if we go back maybe five-ish years on these earnings calls. I remember, making a comment that I didn't believe autonomous driving was going to be at the level that everybody was predicting back in those days. And in fact, we actually -- as I said on the opening call, we doubled down on our belief and started acquiring quite a bit of Copart stock because, I think it was just a general belief at that time that volumes would shrink over time not increase. The -- I could get into all of the sharing economy and I could sum it up with a bunch of examples and analogies. But there is nothing practical about buying a Mercedes-Benz or a BMW or any luxury car. It's a personal choice. There's nothing practical about living in a large home and most of America today, while could live in a much smaller home, chooses a larger home because it's convenient and that's nice. Cars are the same way. I think your personal and while there will be some sharing involved, just like there is some Uber involved, I think for the most part when it's convenient, it's not always convenient in New York City to own a car, but what's convenient in most of America to own a car, I think you'll see that. So I'm of the belief putting that aside, that we're going to see increased volume just as an industry regardless of market share wins, the Copart has had, you're going to see increased volume, because the market just going to continue to grow because the trend that's most important is technology, being put into cars, that's not going to stop. People love technology and they love additional technology going in the cars and that will cause cars to be tougher to repair 10 years from now and those vehicles will be more likely to be written off as a total loss and repaired. So I think the trend of volumes going to continue to increase. Jeffrey Liaw : Craig, I'm just going to jump in and add a little -- a little further, and as you might imagine, we spent a lot of energy tracking technologies changes in behavior, ride sharing and the like, because we do make long-term multiple decades investments in land and technology, etcetera, to support our business. So we very much need to understand it. And at the risk of being pedantic, I think I'd drag this back to the basic algebra of what drives unit volume for Copart and that is vehicle miles traveled, accident frequency and then total loss frequency and then I ask myself what is ride sharing need for each of them. Ride sharing I think for miles traveled almost certainly will drive up the number of miles on the road today. I've seen consulting studies that indicate that every mile of self-driving is replaced by 2.8 miles of ride sharing miles instead that may be bullish, but the point is that almost certainly we have reduced the friction for driving. It's easier now to drive after a couple of drinks, easier for younger or older people to get in the car as well. Vehicle miles will rise. Accident frequency, I think all else equal, I think it's likely neutral. I don't think that Uber and [indiscernible] drivers are systematically superior drivers than the rest of us, you may be more bullish on that front than I am. And then lastly, total loss frequency Ride sharing I think I've no effect here. Total loss frequency has been the one way tailwind for the past 50 years in the business. In 1980 total loss frequency was 4% or thereabouts, today it's more than 5% [ph]. So to me, that is -- those are the individual drivers, the vehicle miles traveled and loss frequency almost certainly will continue to move in our favor, accident frequency, you'll form your own point of view as to how much of the growth in the other two is offset by accident frequency. But in the aggregate, I don't think ride sharing changes the calculus for our business. Craig Kennison : Great, well congratulations to everybody. Thank you. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Jeffrey Liaw : Hey, Bret. Jayson Adair : Good morning. Bret Jordan : And congratulations. Jeff, the question on scrap rate; I do feel that maybe, is there an upper bound on the percentage of crash is that total -- what point the insurance companies no longer see the benefit of totaling, even if the repair cost is higher? I think we're at the high-teens now and is there a number you see that getting to in the next three to five years? Jeffrey Liaw : Bret in short, no. I think you mixed a few things in there that I will try to piece apart. One, you made a comment about scrap rates, which are clearly lower and more than 20% down year-over-year. We used to have that in our script every quarter. We literally didn't even include this year. So I think it's increasingly irrelevant for our business. Our cars as you know, some are sold for parts, many are sold to be rebuilt and repaired, many go overseas for both purposes and therefore the actual metal content in the car is less and less relevant for our fundamental business. Bret Jordan : Jeff, my second question; I should have said total rates as opposed to scrap, that option to the total car as opposed to repair? Jeffrey Liaw : I think in a vacuum that question may be reasonable, which is to say, what if -- in other words, if I were to say to you hypothetically what if total crash cars -- total loss cars were to multiply by five-fold. Will you get to the point where it doesn't make any economic sense to total anymore. All else equal, I think the answer might have been, yes. But if I told you, total loss vehicles can grow by five-fold, while selling prices for those total cars keep rising and substantially so, then I think the problem is solved, right. If there were a finite demand, a fixed demand for that supply of vehicles I think the answer is yes. I think we have proven especially over the past three years that demand is very much not finite. With that global buyer base for rest of US and UK and Canadian cars etc., is robust and growing. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the land of purchase. You commented in the prepared remarks and then you also commented in Germany. Could you talk about what your acreage add in '19 was and maybe what you see acreage expectations for '20 or maybe I'm sort of on an average go-forward basis? Jeffrey Liaw : We generally don't provide that Brett and for a multitude of reasons including that the gross number of acres is actually not all that informative, but -- because the land is not fungible. So what you have in Florida is not relevant to what you have in Texas and California and so forth. So we don't provide that level of details, I think it's almost misleading in it's precision. But I think the punch line is, we invested very meaningfully in land in fiscal 2019. We don't see that trend abating anytime soon. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Daniel Imbro : Good morning, guys. I add my congratulations to the list and thanks for taking my questions. What is there on the non-insurance business? I know you've talked about this in recent quarters, but your language seems to be getting more positive. And Jeff, I think you mentioned it was up to 24% of volume. Could you talk about or update us on your strategic approach to the business? I mean do you foresee that becoming a much larger portion of your volume going forward? And on the margin, where are you winning these units from? Where are they going today that you're taking the units? Thanks. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks for your question, Dan. In short, I think I get that question a fair bit when I'm on the road as to whether, it will grow as a mix of our overall business. And I think what I'd tell you fundamentally, that's not really how we think about running the business. We want to grow our insurance business and we want to grow our non-insurance dealer business, equipment dealers, wholesalers that the entire universe of customers we want to grow. So whether one [indiscernible] even a given year or 5-year period is quote outgrowing the other is less relevant to us and the fact that we want to continue to pursue and grow our business there. I think you heard me briefly allude to the economic proposition and the value proposition, we offer these sellers in the non-insurance universe. I think again, first and foremost is a massive liquid digital auction platform that will yield full and fair values to them, that hard stuff is the most important thing by far. Beyond that of course is the service and the sales force and the marketing efforts that we have underway to pursue and win those customers. I think we win that business from a multitude of different places. From the dealer world, some of those folks may well floor and sell the cars directly themselves and -- look to the large whole care option, others look to newer, modern digital apps C2C, B2C, B2B and otherwise, to which to dispose the vehicles. So there is no doubt, it's a competitive universe. I think our growth in the past few years is a reflection of our success in our, both our marketing efforts, but ultimately the auction platform itself and the price that yield. Daniel Imbro : That's really helpful, thanks. And then touching on the you mentioned I think during your remarks, I think the inventory was up over 18% than the quarter, that's much higher than last quarter and kind of less view. I know that it can move quarter-to-quarter due to timing, but did we see anything accelerate during the quarter that led to such a strong inventory build or was that just a timing issue or a comparison issue that led to that big number? Jeffrey Liaw : I think the inventory growth, as you know from having followed us for a while is the best, but also still imperfect indicator of unit volume for the next quarter or two or three, is certainly is an indication of strong growth in the business and that's how I would interpret it. I would again reiterate that in looking at any of these measures, we look at multiple quarters at a time, not an individual data point that's literally one day July 31, 2019 versus July 31 2018. But nonetheless, that growth rate is not accidental, it is a reflection of both growing market volumes, account wins and growth in our business. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. And then last one for me. Just touching on international growth. I think you guys mentioned it was about 6% on the unit side, again, I know it can be noisy quarter, but it is a step down from, call it four quarters in a row of double-digit growth. Is there anything that changed there? Any market there -- any -- did any specific markets weaken or soften through the quarter? Thanks. Jeffrey Liaw : There is no -- no particular sustained to change that -- is reflected in that number. So I'll be internally consistent and tell you in both directions that a single quarter indicator is not the best and most reliable indicator for the business. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. Thanks so much best of luck guys. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just curious if you've thought about entering the portion of the dealer-to-dealer whole car market that is not physical, but entirely software related. So for example, similar to KAR Auction Services, TradeRev business or ACV Auctions. Well, I think whole car has not been a strong focus for you. I know you're technology platform is highly regarded in the industry and just wondering if maybe there is a way to leverage that an asset light way and then perhaps more generally, following on the earlier question you know if you could elaborate on which parts of the non-insurance market do you consider to be in your addressable market? Jeffrey Liaw : Got it. First, on the all-digital question; I think for us we're always exploring ways to better serve our sellers and buyers and that's certainly one of the paths that we consider and evaluate on an ongoing basis. I think I would note, there are folks who are investing very heavily quite literally losing money and spending cash in on those pathways. While we continue to generate very positive returns on our auction platform. So the overall value proposition for Copart against the backdrop of -- in some cases venture-backed businesses and so forth, continues to grow very well, meaningfully faster than the used car market overall. So I think it's a reflection, at least in part that the Copart auction platform is succeeding in that world as it is, to your second question about the addressable universe. I don't know that we'd exclude anyone. I think there are folks who are more target rich than others, but these are leasing companies, fleets, dealers, independent franchise. So I think anyone with the vehicle to sell, we consider fair game for Copart. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. That's very helpful, thanks. And then just my last question, I was curious if you thought that there might be any change to the competitive environment now that your primary competitor in the US, IAA is standalone business. There has been some speculation that they might wish to more closely emulate Copart strategy. I don't know with regard to investing in different areas, including internationally. Just curious if you have any thoughts on that? Jeffrey Liaw : I think almost certainly a better question for them. Ryan Brinkman : Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Bottiglieri of Wolfe Research. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking the question. Jay, I don't think I've ever heard a more cash in earnings call. Is this mostly from hitting the milestones and some of the significant promotions that were up last night or is there something the business is [indiscernible] of inflictive, but as you very impassioned is frankly looking at the fundamentals, this is the best insurance unit volume that we've seen in quite some time in exit rate, in terms of inventory growth. I was just curious like what's behind this enthusiasm? Thank you. Jayson Adair : We're doing very well right now. There is no question about that. But I felt I should at least tell some of the story of the last 25 years and I promise, not to -- to get the [indiscernible] as the woman on coffee talk does. But when I look back in my head and think about going to New York for the first time, seeing the process and how you take the company public and watching Willis gives his feel to the investment community 10 times a day for two weeks and then to hear that Copart being yelled and screamed and sworn across the floor. I thought it was just a story that had to be told. It's something we talk about sometimes internally, but I think the investment community may not really appreciate the humble beginnings of this Company and what this Company has achieved and the people that make up this Company and how incredible they are. So it's just that -- yes, we're doing well right now, but it's just that, I try not to get emotional sometimes, but it happens and in that case it happened. I guess may be reflecting back in my mind, Willis having a conversation with Willy Weinstein [ph] and us getting ready to open up on the floor, the next thing you know they're screening Copart and there is a bottle of champagne and everybody's taking a sip at 10 o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock in the morning, whenever the hell the Street opens up, but you know that just -- that was just such a great memory and so it's a once in a lifetime I think. And Copart over the years was viewed as -- Oh, Jezz, you guys have tripled the stock now. Oh, Jezz, you guys have six times the stock now. And I don't know what the stock is trading at today, but at $0.50 a share, if it's [indiscernible] bucks we've 160 times the stock and the future for me has never been brighter. I've never seen the market share gains that we are seeing right now and in the history of the Company, I've never seen the kind of volume that's coming in from a market share win and I've never seen the kind of organic growth because of the technology and cars and I've never seen us operate at such a high level in terms of delivering on the service. So that's it in the nutshell. Chris Bottiglieri : No, that's awesome, that's really helpful. And then I wanted to ask maybe bigger picture, long-term question. Do you think like some of this accident avoidance technology fears over blown for your industry, specifically at least near term anyway. Like I wonder if -- like the accident frequency is more prone to low-speed accidents so what's actually left that is in accident is more likely to be totaled, have you looked at that at all in terms of figuring out like that impact it has had? Jayson Adair : Let me make this two parts. Let me turn it over to Jeff after I make this comment. This will give you a -- I think a more precise response or answer to it. Will Franklin [ph] coined the term risk homeostasis. And I think it makes a lot of sense and that is that if you've got auto breaking or you've got adaptive cruise or you've got lane assist and or the car literally drives itself down the road, keeping in the lane, you just got to keep your hands on the wheel, I think those are technologies that allow you to take more risk. Hence the term risk homeostasis. I think it causes people to be distracted more and in some ways, makes the car no more safe. I would as a recipient of damaged cars, I would like to see people drive safely and that at the end of the day is most important, but when you have technology on cars that allow you to be less engaged, people don't multitask well. You're either good at driving the car on you're good at not driving the car and being a passenger. But to drive the car and not fully focus on the car in front of you, the car that's in the line next year because you've got technology to this issue. I don't think it's the best idea. For me personally, I shuttle that stuff off in my cars. I go and hit all the buttons. I don't have any of that stuff working when I drive. I don't want to trying to keep me in my lane, I don't want any of that. On the flip side, when the car does get in a wreck, all that technology has to replaced, that raise the cost of repair, increases total losses. So that's my take. I'll turn to Jeff. Jeffrey Liaw : Chris, what I was going to add is that I think it can be true. I think, which you're alluding to is not simply the one metric measure of accident frequency, but also potentially reduce the severity as well. And I think the answer to that is yes. You could see less physical severity in an accident, so to speak. But I think by the way, if you went back and looked, so if you go back in 10-year increments and take a picture of a borderline salvaged car, total loss car, that car has changed a lot in the last 50 years. 50 years ago, the car with obliterated. It was hammered barely recognizable the vehicle. Today a car that is mildly hit from the rear or the front, can easily be totaled by virtue of the technology you just described. Accident detection and avoidance systems are effectively high value, no generic available sensors on the perimeter of a car. There is a lane departure sensors in the mirrors, the cameras and [indiscernible] in the front and rear bumpers, those are technologies that are expensive to repair, literally for the parts themselves as well as the skill required to install and calibrate them. So while the physical severity may decrease. I think the economic severity is unlikely to be. The cost of repair, we don't think it is going down anytime soon. And I think there is decades worth of evidence to suggest that's true. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. So, that's really helpful. And thanks for the type of thoughts. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Derek Glynn of Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on ASPs, up 8% in the US, still a strong number, but also decelerating from prior quarters. Are there any cause or factors in particular that is causing that rate of change to be a little bit lower than prior periods? Jeffrey Liaw : No, not particularly. I think that ASP number is meaningfully is still growing meaningfully more than the used car market in general, meaningfully more than the ACV, or the pre-accident value, so to speak of the cars that are being consigned through us. So I don't think it's a reflection of any particular change. Derek Glynn : Okay, I understood. And then, Jay, you talked a lot about the marketing efforts of the Company historically. Just curious how you see that marketing program and message unfolding or evolving in the future, particularly as you expand further into international markets? Jayson Adair : Well, let me start with this. For 16 years, we've had data that nobody else in the industry has because every single bid goes through the Internet. We've got every single high bid, every single second high bid, what we call a push bid, every single bid on that vehicle. So we can see that what customers are looking for, it's analogous to Amazon. If you are looking at an iPhone or iPods or something of that nature on the site and you don't buy it, they know, you were looking, they know you're interested. They know that you may actually want cords [ph] some other features. So we have the same ability because they look at every single vehicle and bid online, it allows us to tailor the technology towards pushing vehicles to them. In the old days, we used to say buyer comes to the yard and looks at the car and has to find it. We put it online, buyers can go online and find it, but we've taken down the travel friction. But we haven't taken down the friction of finding and now we find it for you. So if you're online, we're going to very quickly be able to tailor the types of vehicles that you're looking for and what you want. So that's one massive component. The other component I talked about already as a social media piece, we've really been able to create a buzz around the amazing product and the technology the Copart has. And so that when you think about -- you put both of those together, it allows you to create an enormous demand for the cars like Will -- like Jeff said, we're not thinking about scrap prices today, that vehicles are much different and the demand on the vehicles is much different than it was 10 years ago. So it's really change that -- from that standpoint. Then when we think internationally, these trends are happening in Germany, in the UK and other big markets that we're active in. And so we're leveraging knowledge across multiple markets, which is a wonderful thing, and different maybe then Walmart is in the US and Walmart has ASDA in the UK. I don't know if someone who buys at ASDA in the UK is going to buy something in the U.S. With Copart there is a cross-pollination of buyer base, where buyers that are looking at product in the UK may go online and find that Harley, they were looking for in the U.S. and then -- and then bid on it. So there is a fair amount of that that exists across the -- I give that example, but there's a fair amount of that it exist across Polish buyers buying in the UK, become aware of Copart, start to bid in the U.S. that kind of thing. So it's -- that's why you see so much focus from Jeff on talking about international bidding and the rest, because it's a very different game than it was 10 years ago when scrap prices mattered. Derek Glynn : Got all the commentary. Jeffrey Liaw : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jay Adair for closing remarks. Jayson Adair : Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. I appreciate everybody for coming to the call. We look forward to reporting on Q1, and we'll talk to you then. Thanks so much. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation, this concludes today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Dan, and welcome to Copart\u2019s Fiscal 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. I\u2019ll ask Darren Hart, our VP of Finance, to start with the Safe Harbor. Darren Hart : Thanks, Jeff. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income per diluted common share, which includes adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises, and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We\u2019ve provided a recollection of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP measures together with the corresponding GAAP measures is relevant in assessing Copart\u2019s business trends and financial performance. We analyze our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis described above. In addition, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements and comments. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time on our behalf. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management\u2019s discussion and analysis portions of our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Darren. We are certainly pleased with our results for the quarter. Darren, in a moment, will walk through details of those results with the metrics that we traditionally disclose. Wanted to pause for a few minutes also to talk about some of the bigger themes in our business, as those themes, I think, will help explain and drive the results of the past quarter and the past year, and frankly shed light also on our strategic approach to the business. First, we want to talk about the evolution of the total loss universe. I think historically, we\u2019ve been good and the industry has been good about talking about repair costs. And while rising repair costs due to vehicle complexity and age and labor rates and the like, we\u2019re driving increased total loss frequency. Needless to say those trends continue unabated and are accelerating due to rising complexity in the proliferation of accidents \u2013 accident detection and avoidance system. It\u2019s well understood among customers, investors and other stakeholders, that repairing cars has become progressively less attractive economically for many, many years. I think where we\u2019ve been less effective is in communicating the other side of salvage equation and to be precise, I mean the values that we can generate for these cars at auction. The total loss industry has changed very dramatically over Copart\u2019s 37 years, and even fairly significantly over the past five. In our early days of course, salvaged vehicles were literally worked their weights in metals. You see even vestiges of this in earnings calls as recently at a year ago when we were disclosing scrap prices and how they change year-over-year. I\u2019ve been the CFO of Copart for four years. Outside of those earnings calls, we have literally never once talked about scrap prices. Why? Because the cars that we sell increasingly instead, became valuable for their parts competition. As the dismantling industry evolves and the OEMs leverage their aftermarket parts businesses for profit through higher prices, the dismantling industry helped to drive salvage values upwards. Since then, however, there has been a still more significant shift in our industry, which is that today these cars are not worth their weight in metals, not worth per se their value as parts, but instead their value as drivable, rebuildable vehicles, which has forever altered the salvage equation for ourselves and for our insurance company partners. The punch line then there is that the rising total loss frequency isn\u2019t just a function of preparing cars becoming more expensive, it\u2019s that totaling them and selling them has become more attractive over time as well. We have a number of initiatives under way with our insurance carrier partners for whom this reality is becoming more and more apparent. We intend to help them further optimize their claims processes, yielding more totals and earlier ones as well. But how? How we\u2019ve been able to drive those volume increases with price increases at the same time is in part by becoming a still more global business, our physical reach, our brand reputation and, of course, the auction platform liquidity that we offer has expanded buyer universe for our cars and lifted the prices we can achieve at auction. You can see it first hand that our unit growth rate has certainly eclipsed that of the industry in general and certainly that of the dismantling industry as well, while our prices at auction had actually increased. And that\u2019s because the fastest-growing economies in the world, in Eastern Europe, in Africa and Central and South America are also the lowest automotive penetration markets in the world. So while we have grown our supply very substantially over the past few years, we\u2019ve grown our demand much more still through our proactive marketing efforts. And that\u2019s the second thing I wanted to briefly tackle, and that\u2019s Copart\u2019s auction liquidity being the flywheel that generates differentiated value for ourselves and for our customers. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get questions in Q&A about certain market share wins and insurance. You already know that we don\u2019t comment on specific accounts on an individual basis. But I think we emphasized that over time we have grown market share very steadily over the years, we just haven\u2019t talked about them on an individual account basis. Why? Ultimately because auction results are the most important, we generate better value at auction than the rest of the industry, and service levels as well, which we believe we deliver better than others. The growth for our auction liquidity has further been enhanced by organic industry growth, of course, the same total loss frequency phenomena we described a moment ago. And then growth in our non-insurance business, which is fueled by, but also helps contribute to our insurance business. Every car we earn the right to sell from an automotive dealer also increases the value proposition of our auction and ultimately raises the price we can achieve in our insurance cars as well. We\u2019ve made the investments in land and technology, process and people for decades that enabled us to grow this platform, making it more valuable with each passing year to our customers and to us. And so the virtuous cycle of auction liquidity continues. The last thing I wanted to tackle is our international expansion efforts, which, you already know has been an important driver of our past, but likewise will be an important driver of our future growth as well. We described in great detail during our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call our expansion efforts in Germany, our strategy there remains consistent. Build the physical infrastructure necessary to effectively serve a nationwide footprint, build logistics capabilities, enable rapid vehicle pickups, use purchased cars to seed our German auctions, leverage Copart buyer \u2013 global buyer network, and bring our value proposition to overhaul the claims process for the German insurance industry. As you know already from Germany, our intentions are to expand elsewhere in Western Europe as well. Our year-over-year and sequential trends in Germany are encouraged with substantial growth in unit volumes, revenue and trading profits providing very clear indications that our consignment model will be an economically superior proposition for the insurance carriers in the German market in general. With that, why don\u2019t we dive into the specifics of the quarter, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to our Vice President, Darren Hart. Darren Hart : Thanks, Jeff. We delivered another strong quarter with record first quarter revenues, gross profits and operating profits. Global revenues grew by 20.2% or $93.1 million, despite $3.9 million in foreign currency headwinds, primarily due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. Global service revenue grew by 23.6%. Our purchased vehicle sales were flat as we converted a substantial UK customer from a purchase-based sales contract to a fee-based sales contract. First quarter global unit sales volumes increased by 12.4% and vehicle inventories grew by 14.1% versus Q1 of last year. U.S. revenues grew by 25%, fueled by higher average selling prices and a 13.2% volume increase driven by organic growth from our existing insurance and non-insurance customers and market share gains. Our non-insurance business represents approximately 24% of total U.S. sales volumes and includes franchises, independent dealers, finance and leasing companies, fleets, charities, equipment dealers and wholesalers. Excluding charities, our non-insurance unit sales volume increased by 13%. We attribute the growth across non-insurance to our increased marketing, sales and operational focus and our auction liquidity. First quarter U.S. average selling prices grew 4.2% year-over-year. ASPs continue improving as a result of more bidders, more international bidders, and therefore auction liquidity, as well as an increasing mix of newer less-damaged cars. International bidding and buying activity reflect our proactive marketing efforts, as well as the effectiveness of our all-digital auction platform, VB3. Year-over-year, we increased unique international bidders and unique domestic bidders by over 20%. The outcome is higher bids per unit and therefore better selling prices for our customers. Our selling prices continue to significantly outpace various used car indices such as the Manheim used car price index, which was roughly flat this quarter versus last year. Increasing ASPs then cycle back to our unit growth drivers. U.S. vehicle inventories grew by 15% due to these continued strong industry tailwinds as well as market share gains. International revenues were flat due to the aforementioned customer contract shift from purchase to fee based revenue and unfavorable foreign currencies. International service revenues grew by 11.4%, while international volumes grew 8.4% and international vehicle inventories grew 8.1%. Globally, purchased vehicle sales were flat as U.S. and Germany purchased vehicle growth was offset by UK customer contract shift. Globally, gross profit grew from $195.9 million to $254.9 million or 30.1%, and gross margin percentage grew from 42.5% to 46%, an expansion of 350 basis points. U.S. gross margins grew from 45.2% to 49.2%, driven by rising ASPs and operational efficiencies. International gross margins declined from 31.4% to 29.5%, in part due to the increasing mix of our German business. In the U.S. and globally, we do note rising labor, health insurance and selling costs. However, these rising costs have been offset in part by rising ASPs and operational efficiencies. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock compensation and depreciation, increased from $34.8 million a year ago to $38.8 million, primarily driven by a $3.7 million pre-tax charge related to the employer portion of payroll taxes on certain executive stock compensations.  This one-time charge has been reflected as such on an after-tax basis in the non-GAAP earnings, included in our earnings release. Beyond this item, international G&A growth, in support of the expansion of our European businesses, was offset by a lower U.S. G&A due to decreased legal costs and higher capitalized software development. While our G&A may fluctuate modestly in any given quarter, we continue to generally expect G&A expenses will grow, but provide operating leverage overtime. Operating income grew from $151.4 million to $205.4 million or 35.6%, which represents a 420 basis point operating margin expansion, inclusive of an unfavorable $800,000 year-over-year foreign currency impact. Net interest expense was up year-over-year from $3.7 million to $4 million, primarily due to reduced offsetting interest income given our lower average cash balances. The Q1 income tax benefit of $16.1 million reflects a $62.4 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options and a $3 million tax benefit from other discrete income tax items. The one-time benefit from the exercise of employee stock options as well as the discrete income tax benefits have been included and reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. GAAP net income increased from $114.1 million to $218.2 million or 91.2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income increased 36.9% from $113.3 million to $155.4 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share grew from $0.47 to $0.91 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew from $0.47 to $0.65 or 38.3%. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We adopted a new lease standard, ASC 842, this quarter and now show a $136.4 million operating lease right-of-use asset and $140.3 million of operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $181.1 million in cash and $219.5 million in net debt. Operating cash flows for the quarter were $212.5 million, an increase of $105 million, driven by higher earnings, due in part to the large income tax benefit. We invested $131.5 million in CapEx during the quarter, with over 85% attributable to capacity expansion. Given the sustained industry-wide volume fueled growth by higher \u2013 due to a higher total loss frequency, we remain focused on purchasing and developing land to meet current and prospective demand. We currently have 39 new yard and expansion projects in the engineering phase and 33 projects in the development phase. During the quarter, we also collected $12.6 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and paid $101.4 million for employee stock-based withholdings. We thank you for your continued interest in Copart. Dan, if you\u2019d open it up to questions, that would be appreciated. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in the queue comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Bob Labick : Good morning, and congratulations on another nice quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Bob Labick : I wanted to start, you\u2019ve talked a lot about your strong international buyer base, you brought it up, say, obviously, and how it benefits your insurance customers, I guess, actually all your customers that are selling. Can you give us a little more color on the types of cars the international buyers are most focused on? Is it the same as the general pattern in the U.S.? Are they more focused on insurance or non, newer or older cars? Just a little color into what they\u2019re buying. Jeff Liaw : Bob, thanks for the question, and a good one. I think in general, they are \u2013 the demand is similar with the one nuance being that they will \u2013 their interest is typically on higher value vehicles, which makes logical sense because a car which is a very old battery case, which is largely just metal value, you would never bother to ship overseas. So they tend to focus on rebuildable, drivable vehicles in particular. And those \u2013 so they overlap very heavily. I would say that we talk about how international bidders are purchasing approximately half the value of our U.S. options, plus or minus. They did of course on many, many more cars still than that. So the point being that it is similar in the aggregate with the nudge to higher value cars. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just related to that roughly half the value of cars purchased, I know you don\u2019t target numbers like that at all, but \u2013 so where do you think the percentage goes given the trends in the industry right now over the next three years to five years? Again, I know you\u2019re just focusing on service \u2013 servicing your customers and things, you\u2019re not targeting any number, but where do you think it might go? Jeff Liaw : Don\u2019t have an end state in mind, Bob. Think that it has grown steadily overtime. There are a number of important secular tailwinds there that we mentioned a few moments ago about economic growth in those markets, low automotive penetration. I think we take for granted here in the U.S. that mobility is essential for our economic well-being for education or healthcare and the like. In those economies, likewise have demand for the same mobility. So overtime, I think there will be still more demand for U.S. vehicles, wrecked cars that could become drivable cars there, but we don\u2019t have an end state in mind per se, Bob. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay. And then looking at dealer cars, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of growth from franchise and independent dealer sales, on Copart over the past couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about the typical car that\u2019s consigning to you and who the buyers are? Is that international? Or is that other dealers? Or just a little more info on that dealer cars? Jeff Liaw : Both. I think the dealer car \u2013 dealer source cars, I think you know, has been an area of emphasis for us for years, with meaningful growth really over a number of quarters now year-over-year. And that\u2019s because our value proposition, again, it\u2019s the same one as it is for the insurance carriers that has delivered auction values which matter the most to them. And that is a function of the phenomena we talked about a moment ago, that is liquidity, that is marketing efforts, that is international buyers and domestic alike. So it is again a fairly representative sample of buyers on the other side of the equation. Bob Labick : Super. All right. Thanks so much. Jeff Liaw : Thank Bob. Operator : Our next question in the queue comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Craig Kennison : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. And Jeff, thanks for the dramatic overview. I wanted to start with the UK conversion. With that conversion to a consignment model, should we anticipate three more quarters of pressure on vehicle sales from that customer? Jeff Liaw : The word pressure, I probably hesitate, it\u2019s the math, yes, will persist for \u2013 will persist for a few quarters if that\u2019s you mean. I think for us, it\u2019s not pressure per se, because I think we think about cars, our economics on a unit economics basis, per unit basis more so than we do the actual gross revenue. Craig Kennison : Got it. And then I have another math question where we don\u2019t get to use numbers, but clearly you earned significant business from \u2013 and ensure that previously committed nearly all of its volume to a competitor. First, why do you think Copart won that business? And second, this was described as a 30% volume customer that\u2019s going to happen, most of which by the end of this year, does all of that math jive with how you understand the relationship? Jeff Liaw : Craig, you find us unsatisfying, but we\u2019ve been very \u2013 about not commenting on individual customers. More generically, we have earned very significant market share for years and for decades, often organically. And the reasons in general, for not commenting on specific accounts, are that we deliver superior auction results, that is first and foremost, certainly depending on where we are in a historical cycle, other considerations like catastrophic events and the like can also factor the decision, but ultimately it\u2019s about the economic value we deliver to our customers, number one. Number two, related but somewhat \u2013 is service levels, and that in turn is a function of our yard network, our people, our technology, our process, how well do we service and account day-to-day, week-to-week, year-to-year. And then of course, as I noted a moment, how we service them in times of crisis as well. That\u2019s how every insurance carrier considers their salvage partner decisions and depending on who the partner is and when you \u2013 where we are in history, they\u2019ll prioritize differently, but those are the criteria that anyone would make that decision on. Craig Kennison : And then my last question is just around innovation and what you might be doing to innovate your services or your auction platform. There has been talk lately among your competitors about improving cycle times through a platform that would connect banks and insurers or better video and camera views such that you have a better look of the interior or exterior of the car if you\u2019re bidding from all the way across the ocean. Jeff Liaw : Yes. Good question. And I think, perhaps we\u2019ve been remiss in not describing them robustly enough on our earnings calls. But in general, we take those services \u2013 those types of services very seriously. So I\u2019ll comment just on one, for example, the loan payoff question I think you just raised. And for those who aren\u2019t already in the node, one complication in the resolution of a total loss claim can be that a policyholder has an outstanding loan on his or her car, so before the salvage plan can be resolved altogether, the loan payoff balance to per owed on that loan needs to be obtained by the carrier and the policyholder so that the lender conversely paid-off. As I understand it, others in the industry are in alpha or beta testing for a product they intend to launch at some point. We launched ours in May of 2019, so whole six months ago, we had an automated loan payoff offering already delivered to our customers. We didn\u2019t talk about it on our earnings calls per se. We recognize that as an important consideration for an insurance carrier and wanting to resolve those claims. We love the claims process. We are meticulous students of it. We appreciated it for a while now that this is a second point at a bottleneck and we developed and delivered service accordingly six months ago. Craig Kennison : I\u2019m sorry to follow-up, is there any way you can describe the cycle time improvement from that loan payoff tool? Jeff Liaw : Hard to do, Craig, because it\u2019s very hard to isolate variables. As you might imagine that is on a portion of the cars that have loans outstanding and a portion still for which those financial institutions are connected to various intermediaries that we have partnered with. So it is not always quite black and white, but it\u2019s certainly a tangible improvement, both we and our insurance partners appreciate it. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig Operator : And our next question in the queue comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the market share gains, Jeff. You alluded to that the economics in the dollar returns in the business that you get the insurers that was I think that your lead off point into why the company has been successful over the years in terms of gaining share. Is there any way you could kind of peel back the onion a little bit on that topic for us a little bit? Potentially over the last few years, how that dollar return number to the insurer maybe has changed if you think the gap is widened? And then also, what do you contribute the gap to? Is it just purely the build out of the international buyer base and just scale? Just love to know a little bit more on that topic. Jeff Liaw : Sure. So the delivered values at auction, you\u2019ve heard us describe the length on this call the international buyers and how important they are. And I think that sometimes maybe underappreciated that how relevant they are both for the units that are ultimately acquired by international buyers, but also on all of the other units they bid on, right? They just help provide value disclosure, full and fair value realization across virtually all the units that Copart offers. Beyond that, there are number of other considerations too. VB3, if you haven\u2019t already, you should quote attend an online auction to Copart and do so for others in the industry and render your own judgments. But we have what we think is the best-in-class technology for sellers and buyers alike, which yields \u2013 which has for us anyway, yielded increasing bidders. So bidders and bids well in excess, even if our unit growth, meaning bids per unit \u2013 domestic bids per unit, international bids per unit have very consistently increased for a long time. So it\u2019s mostly about the auction liquidity phenomena we just described, John. John Healy : Great. And then, just wanted to ask about the land investment in the quarter. Kind of jumped up a little bit. And I was curious to know if you could help us think about what we should be thinking about in terms of normalized land spend over the next couple of years? And should we look at Q1 as kind of anomaly or a sign of things to come here? Jeff Liaw : I think it\u2019s capital expenditures, in particular, I think are hard to extrapolate from a given quarter, but we\u2019re talking about parcels of land and in some cases costs, multiple tens of millions of dollars. So reading into one quarter\u2019s numbers I think is bouncy. I would say that if you consider the past four years to be quote elevated capital expenditure levels for Copart, those investments will continue for years to come, both as necessary for the business that we have today as well as growth we anticipate. John Healy : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Jeff Liaw : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Hey, Jeff, if you could put it in perspective, may be give us a feeling for what the yield spread does look like versus the average competitor. Obviously, you\u2019ve done a good job building out the end buyer base, and the frequency of their bidding. But could you sort of quantify how much the yield those benefit your auction? Jeff Liaw : Tough to quantify, Bret. We know, we believe it is significant, we believe that the industry has generally voted with its feet, but literally an individual car, of course, would not be sold on both auctions, you would never have and all else equal, auction comparison like-for-like. But we believe that simply the international proposition of our bids, the increasing number of bids per unit over time, this is pretty compelling evidence. That\u2019s true. Bret Jordan : Do you think it\u2019s single-digit percentage points or double-digit percentage points, I mean sort of ballpark? Jeff Liaw : Bret, I don\u2019t know. I would \u2013 I can\u2019t. We really don\u2019t have the data to do that, but literally no cars that were sold on both \u2013 on multiple auctions. So it\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t quantify that. Bret Jordan : Okay. All right. And then a question, I guess, you talked about mix and maybe 50% of the volume is now being rebuilt. Could you compare that to where we were five years ago? You sound like we\u2019ve got a big change recently. But what percent was scrap, what percent was dismantled, and what percent was built five years ago versus that? Jeff Liaw : Won\u2019t be able to point-to-point comparisons in part, because we don\u2019t have perfect visibility either buyer who buys 400 units from us may have different intentions for different of those units. We can surmise that if they\u2019re based in the Ukraine, they intend to drive them again versus if it\u2019s a buyer who is six miles away, also owns a scrap yard, we can guess \u2013 we can render a different judgment. But those would be estimates in the aggregate, I think directionally very clearly all have been \u2013 it\u2019s been a very significant shift from scrap and dismantling in favor of rebuildable drivable cars. You can see that in part also in the \u2013 and literally the physical appearances of the cars we\u2019ve been selling, if you attended the Copart auction in the 1980s, and saw what was sort of 50% damaged car, you can see one that is obliterated that very clearly will never be returned to growth. If you look at the car today with 50% damage, it looks like a car. It probably had a technology set, if you even were willing to temporarily forgo, you could drive the car right away. So the very nature of the car has changed as well. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I guess, do you have any new thoughts as far as the upper boundary of total loss rates? If we\u2019re in the high teens now, what that number could go to? Jeff Liaw : No new thoughts. And perhaps, we have old ones then. And that is to say the total loss frequency, I think, folks who see 20% or whatever today wonder, could it someday be capped at 25%. And I think if you take then the 40-year view and look back to 1980, you\u2019ll see the total loss frequency then is 4%. So if it went from 4% to 20%, I don\u2019t see the logic in believing that it will ultimately tug out as 25% instead. If we\u2019re having this conversation any point over the past 40 years, I think we would have foreseen ceilings that are quite a bit less than reality ended up being. So our view is that, so long as there is a natural outlet for these cars in the form of international buyers, in particular, in higher growth economies, who need cars that there is no particular \u2013 there is no ceiling, there is no gauge on where total loss frequency can go. Bret Jordan : Yes. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Our next question in the queue comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi, thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the \u2013 hey, first one is on the ASP growth. I mean, pretty demonstrable growth there last year. I mean 4% still really impressive. But want to get your sense if you\u2019re lapping anything or kind of how do you think about that decelerate here on ASP growth? Jeff Liaw : I think there is enough noise in any given quarter that I think it\u2019s all \u2013 you hear me talk about this in \u2013 with respect to many variables in our business, this one included. I look over a longer period of time. That said, selling price improvement is a good solid quarter for us and it\u2019s been consistent now that we\u2019ve been up consecutively for 12 quarters or so. As you know there are secular and cyclical forces here. The secular ones being total loss frequency that as we total more cars, those are generally better ones. Secular drivers maintained [indiscernible] improved more of them, they will drive ASPs upward as well. There are cyclical forces here as well, including currency, I think of that sort that can cause fluctuations in both directions. So I think we\u2019re \u2013 we are happy to continue delivering better values for our customers. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. It\u2019s okay. And then I kind of re-ask a question different way that was asked earlier. But when I look at your CapEx in an LTM basis, it\u2019s about $440 million. It\u2019s roughly double what it was a few years ago, yet the yard ups and depreciation have kind of barely bunched recently. So I guess this would imply that you\u2019re \u2013 you probably have more land at development phase right now. And I\u2019ll track the number. I can go back and see if you disclosed that. But just wanted to get a sense for what\u2019s behind the set an urgency of land expansion? If there is any way to kind of thematically bifurcate where you\u2019re kind of added capacity or is it internationally, domestically, is it yard expansion existing yards? Are you trying to \u2013 is the biggest of customer win? So anything you can do to provide clarity on the capacity additions there would be helpful. Jeff Liaw : The strong majority of these expenditures are for our quote traditional markets, so ones in which we\u2019ve been doing business in for a long time, and they are a reflection of demands \u2013 demand to-date, meaning if you have perfect visibility into every Copart yard, you\u2019d be able to see that plenty of them could use more space now. Therefore, a good portion of this CapEx is for expansions. Whatever we can expand into contiguous space, we of course would love to. But the operating efficiencies that affords us, and when necessary we will expand it \u2013 we will instead build new facilities elsewhere. So you\u2019re right to guess that we have many facilities in development. What\u2019s driving that is simply demand \u2013 demand today and demand growth in the future. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our last question in the queue comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Derek Glynn : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a follow-up on yard ops. You\u2019ve gained some leverage on that line item over time, probably helped in part by higher pricing. But I\u2019m wondering if you see any areas of inefficiencies there that you guys can tackle or any initiatives for that cost item in particular to drive further margin improvement? Jeff Liaw : It\u2019s a fair question and the answer is somehow both yes and no. So this is an area of relentless focus for us, it is how we optimize the efficiency of our yard operations. And therefore, we are \u2013 we deploy initiatives all the time, including for example, a self-help driver app last year, which reduces weight for unnecessary trips that our drivers make to our yard. So at that times hundreds, we have a number of initiatives under way. I don\u2019t know that any of them will yield a step function change. In some cases, they help to offset natural inflation we see in our business from fuel and healthcare and other factors I\u2019m sure you know quite well. So yes, it is an area of ongoing emphasis for us and it has been worked. Derek Glynn : Got it. And then just secondly, it\u2019s been a couple of years since you announced the acquisition of NPA. Just wanted to get an update there. Can you give us a sense of how the powersports business is progressing? What its contribution to growth has looked like? And broadly, if it met your expectations? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Yes. NPA has been a great acquisition for us. We\u2019re thrilled that they are \u2013 they are a part of the Copart family today. I think you may remember from the time we did the deal that our logic was twofold. We needed to like the transaction on a stand-alone basis and we needed also to believe that it would add \u2013 it would contribute strategic value to Copart and our insurance and non-insurance business as well. I think it\u2019s delivered on both fronts. The business has grown organically on its own, meaning the powersports business, the auction that we run through NPA have grown on their own. And likewise, its contributed to our expertise when it comes to the powersports space, which you may remember we noted is a nuance in different markets, in many respects as well. So now having that expertise in-house has contributed to our capabilities in our traditional business as well. So yes, on both counts. Derek Glynn : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : And speakers, there are no more questions in the queue. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you for joining us for the call. We\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and it's a pleasure to welcome you all to the second quarter call. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeff Liaw, our President for Safe Harbor, and then I'll give you a quick update on the company, and he will give an update on financial performance. So with that, Jeff? Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Jay. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, disposal of non-operating assets, foreign currency related gains, certain income tax benefits, and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises, and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link, and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our statements. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. For a more complete discussion of the risks that could affect our business, please review the management's discussion and analysis portions in our related periodic reports filed with the SEC. Jay? Jay Adair : Thank you, Jeff. For starters, I'd like to state that we have never been better prepared for the future. When we think about capacity, we think about it globally, and whether it's in Europe or the U.S., we have more capacity to date we have ever had. This is an effort that has been ongoing for the last five years to build out a network of locations that are closer to the car, and then have more room, so that we can continue to handle vehicles that come in, due to continued total loss rates, again due to technology in cars, and due to market share gains that we have seen over the last five years. We expect that both those trends will continue, and I'm happy to say we have the capacity to handle that. When it comes to catastrophes, whether they be small catastrophes or super storm events, there is no match for the way that Copart handles a cab. Our preparedness has never been better through equipment that we utilize in the field, through locations where we have large facilities that can store 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 vehicles in a super storm event, to the process we've developed over the last five years, and to the technology that we deploy, it is not an understatement to say that our position in the industry is unmatched when it comes to those events.  Our people are also the best in the industry, whether it be through our tenure, as the company has achieved so many years of success now, whether it be the training, or the talent, their ability is unmatched and I put a huge, huge amount of credit on our success over the last five years and wins due to the people that run this company. Our technology continues to lead the industry. We've been a leader in the technology space now for 20 years, moving completely online back in 2003, 17 years ago. And I would put our technology teams up against any of the tech titans in Silicon Valley. What we have developed over the years, and what we are developing currently and that we\u2019ll be rolling out in the years to come, we'll continue to keep the gap between us and our competitors, and offer a service offering to our customers that is unmatched. Copart is a technology company, but we're also a land holding company with over 10,000 acres, over 200 facilities, and we're also a logistics company. We're picking up over 250,000 vehicles a month, and we do that from assignment to pick up in less than a day. Through our people, our process, and our technology, we\u2019ll continue to win.  With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to our President, Jeffrey L., for an update on the financials and the performance of the company. Jeff? Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. As Jay noted, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. It was a record second quarter for Copart in revenue, gross profit, and operating income. We experienced global revenue growth of 6% or $90 million to change over last year. Our U.S. revenue grew at 23.8%. The international revenue nominally declined 2.6% year-over-year, but that's primarily due converting a substantial U.K. customer from a purchase-based sales contracts to a fee-based arrangement instead. Our global service revenue grew $93.2 million or 22% year-over-year, which along with units sold, is a more accurate measure of the underlying activity in our business. As we've noted on our prior calls, vehicle sales and costs are disproportionately visible in comparison to their economic relevance to our business. Our purchased vehicles declined $3 million year-over-year for the second quarter, or 4.4%, due primarily again to the shift of the U.K customer from our purchase arrangements to a fee-based consignment engagement. Our global unit sales grew by 13.7% year-over-year, with U.S. units growing 15.3%, and international units growing 5.7%. Our U.S. unit growth was driven by organic growth from our existing insurance customers and non-insurance customers, as well as market share gains. The long-term trends we've noted in prior discussions in favor of riding total loss frequency are continuing, driving organic growth from insurance customers, as the strong salvage returns we generate at auction continue to become more and more economically attractive, compared to rising repair costs. We continue to grow our noninsurance business, as well, nominally on a unit basis 5.8% year-over-year, which reflects growth in certain seller groups, such as automotive dealers, offset by proactive capacity management efforts on our part with charities and wholesalers. Excluding those charities and wholesalers, our noninsurance business grew on a unit basis 20.6% year-over-year. We attribute this growth to our increased marketing and sales efforts. But perhaps most notably, to the auction liquidity we achieved at Copart. We have brought a large pool of buyers and sellers together, and the auction liquidity we deliver to our sellers, we would argue, is the very best in the industry. Our global inventory increased 7.5% year-over-year. U.S. inventory grew at that same 7.5%. International inventory growth just north of that at 7.8%. This inventory growth was again driven by the same unit growth trends noted above, both industry growth as well as customer wins. Our gross profit grew from $208.2 million to $259.9 million or 24.8% increase year-over-year. We experienced a gross margin rate change from 42.9 to 45.2 with gross margins expanding by 230 basis points. A portion of this is attributable, of course, to that same shift of the customer from a principle-based arrangement to a fee-based arrangement. In addition to that, we achieved efficiencies across the globe in the form of operational leverage, which helped to further expand gross margins. In the U.S. and globally, we would again, as always, note rising labor health insurance fuel costs, towing costs, et cetera, offset also by generally benign trends in ASPs, as well as operating leverage. On those average selling prices in particular, in the U.S., our ASPs grew at 0.7% year-over-year. Our ASPs continue their growth. That reflects, I believe, now 13 consecutive quarters of ASP growth in the U.S. That ASP lift is a product of more bidders, more international bidders, and therefore more auction liquidity. This is the year-over-year comparison, as well as an increase in mix of newer, less damaged cars. That's a trend we talk about on our call now for years, and it continues to prove true. International bidding and buying activity, again a reflection of our proactive marketing efforts, as well as the effectiveness of our all digital auction platform, VB3. The outcome is that we generate more auction activity, more bids per unit, and therefore, better selling prices for our customers. Just shy of 50% of the value of our U.S. auctions are attributed or won by international buyers, and the vast majority of our units have their prices affected and lifted by the participation of those same international buyers. Turning to general and administrative expenditures, I'll speak about them, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation. They are up from $33.2 million a year ago to $39.2 million this quarter. It's also up slightly sequentially by about $400,000 relative to the first quarter. In general, G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time, as with other numbers on our P&L and our cash flow statement. We can only encourage folks to take a multiple quarter view in projecting the business. We continue to believe we can achieve operating leverage, given the top line growth rates we have experienced in recent years. We do believe there are -- as with yard cost, there are certain inflationary pressures here regarding labor rates, health care costs, and the like, but we believe we can achieve operating leverage, nonetheless. Our GAAP operating income grew from $164.7 million to $209.9 million, or an increase of 27.4%, reflecting 250 basis points of operating margin expansion. Our net interest expense is roughly flat year-over-year at approximately $4.5 million. Other expense slash income of $400,000 in this case, largely attributable to currency gains, offset by losses from certain non-consolidated equity positions of ours. Our second quarter income tax of $36.4 million reflects a $14.8 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which has been reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings included in our release from yesterday. GAAP net income increased from $131.4 million to $168.7 million for the second quarter this year, or an increase of 28.4% year-over-year. And finally on the P&L, our non-GAAP net income decreased from $124.9 million to $153.5 million, growth of 22.9% year-over-year. Turning then to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, we finished the quarter with $93.5 million of cash on the balance sheet at $320 million in change of net debt. We adopted a new lease standard, as you likely know already, this year -- last quarter, in the first quarter of 2020. And we now show $104 million as an operating lease right of use assets with the corresponding $105 million liability on the balance sheet as well. On the cash flow statement, we generated operating cash flow of $144.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $37 million, driven principally by higher earnings year-over-year. Our capital expenditures of $269 million in the quarter. The strong majority of these capital expenditures were for capacity expansion, per our practice in recent years. I'll note here that we continue to invest aggressively in capacity expansion to serve both industry growth, as well as our market share wins. As we discussed in great length in the past, permitting is a complex and collaborative dialogue with the communities in which we do business. So, the timing of the completion of certain purchases is always subject to lumpiness in our cash flow statement. We will invest millions, and in some cases, tens of millions of dollars at a time for single assets, single site completions. We're delighted for ourselves in our customers that we\u2019re able to achieve and to execute this past quarter's worth of capital projects. That said, even in this capacity growth period of Copart's history, the quarter obviously is an outsized CapEx quarter for us. We would look to the last few years as more indicative of our general run rate in a growth period. With that, I'll make a few final comments on our efforts in Germany, and then we can open it up for Q&A. Regarding our efforts in Germany, our strategy and approach continue unabated. We are investing very substantially in people, and technology, and in lands. We continue to source cars as a principle to build liquidity, and we're getting progressively better at it.. However, the real long-term objective remains unchanged, as well, which is to earn consignment volumes to serve the insurance industry there, both for the carriers\u2019 direct economic benefits and lower claims costs, as well as their benefits in improved policyholder experiences in the cases of total loss. We have active dialogues with decision makers at major carriers, and have sold cars on a consignment basis for the insurance industry in Germany. We look forward to discussing that further with you on future calls as well. With that, Samantha, I'll ask you to open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : Good morning. I just wanted to start on the last call you alluded to helping some carriers optimize their claims process. Can you talk more about that how it's going? Have there been any initial results or is that a long-term game plan, is that a 2020, 2021? How should we think about that? Jeff Liaw : Bob, I'd characterize that is a 40-year journey. That's something we do literally every day. We may have spoken about it in somewhat greater detail on the last earnings calls, but we view it as-- our principal job is to improve the claims process and economic outcomes for our insurance customers and there is in term. So there are certainly individual products that we have in the queue, products we have released, products that we are already selling, but I wouldn't view that as a discrete change per se in what we do, Bob just an ongoing purposeful commitment to that very outcome. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, thanks. And then you just spoke about obviously the highest CapEx quarter you've had. Was all the land in the U.S. is this international as well? Are you still looking to keep a similar pace in the last two years going forward? Can you just give us little more color on that? Jeff Liaw : The vast majority of the capital expenditures will be in the U.S. with some internationally, but the vast majority will be U.S. So I called it out because it is obviously a much higher rate that we have incurred in recent years. We have announced our 2020 initiatives in April of 2016 if memory serves, so approximately 4 years ago we began this aggressive capacity expansion phase in our history. I would look to the past few years as more indicative of the run rate of our expenditures in this capacity growth phase more so than this past quarter. It is the nature of the beast, Bob, as you know having been in the industry for a long time that CapEx is by nature is lumpy because you closed on our property that could have been literally tens of millions of dollars and then or is delayed by 6 months. And so the tens of millions of dollars of expenditures await you in a few quarters time. So we don't endeavor to smooth it. We simply want to acquire and develop the land, so we have it available for our customers and ourselves as soon as we can and sometimes it happens all at once. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, great. It sounds I guess crazy to ask this given I think 14% volume growth in the quarter and for several years, double-digit volume growth. But are you currently constrained on growing faster based on your capacity? Have you reached equilibrium now that you're just acquiring new capacity for future growth? Can you talk about where you stand if there have been constraints before, if you've reached what you need to get for current levels? Jeff Liaw : So it's a fair question. I think as Jay noted at the top. We've invested in the land, so that we could serve our customers exceptionally well across all markets if and when they are ready to do business with us. So that\u2019s our commitment to them which is also as you may have heard during the discussion there within certain noninsurance sellers of ours. We've made proactive decisions to free capacity in that respect for these critical insurance customers in particular. I wouldn't say it's been a gating factor, Bob. But it has required us to make an all hands on deck effort to acquire and develop that land. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, super. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about industry trends, what you're seeing in terms of claims activity and the total loss rate and how you see that unfolding in 2020. Jeff Liaw : I'll take a bigger step back, Craig and make a broader observation. I think we are seeing claims activity that's relatively flat year-over-year in terms of the nominal claims. So these are the same data points I'm sure that you track already regarding certain carriers who disposed probably their claims results as well as certain industry aggregators to do the same. Over most of our 40-year history, I think we've seen claims frequency generally decline. Very modestly over time as cars get safer perhaps drivers get better. One anomalous period for that trend of course was 2011-2016 when smartphone penetration -- smartphone distraction was perhaps at its peak but otherwise, for most of our 40-year history, accident frequency has generally declined over time. However, the one way tailwind in our business as you know has been total loss frequency, which has increased very steadily over time. I think individual months and quarters are tough to measure. I think there is always going to be a lot of noise in that number, but I think if you take any kind of step back at all, you can see that trend continues to move up and for reasons I think that become reasonably clear once you dig, they have set below the surface, which is that the cars are becoming our cars are becoming more sophisticated over time or technologically involved and, therefore, all of the sensors and cameras and the motor car, making it more difficult to prepare. So, repair costs are rising, which makes repairers less compelling while at the same time our auction liquidities improving our international buyer base is expanding. So, quite literally at the same time prepares are worse salvage is literally better which is what it's driven total loss frequency increased sixfold -- fivefold sixfold over the past 40 years and why we think it will continue to rise over the years to come. I expect that in 2020, I know there's a bit of a long-winded answer but I expect that this year, but frankly for years and decades to come. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then looking at your European business, and European car park, are there is substantial differences in the constitution of that car parks such that we'd see a different trend in total loss rate or claims frequency? Jeff Liaw : In the broader strokes, no. There certainly are local and country-specific idiosyncrasies that can affect exactly how we enter and how we participate. But in broad strokes, no. The cars are similar, the underlying drivers that's make the total loss such a compelling economic proposition here in the U.S. and in the UK are by and large true there too, which is to say, high-labor prepare high-labor cost repair costs vehicle complexity. And frankly, again emerging and growing it demand for those same brand of cars. Craig Kennison : And lastly, how would you frame the conversations you're having today with European insurance carriers versus those conversations maybe a year or 2 ago, now that you've got sort of assets on the ground and an active platform working in Europe? Jeff Liaw : Fair question, Craig. [Indiscernible] much more productive. It's one thing to discuss analogs to the UK and the U.S. and why the economic proposition can or should be compelling. It's another matter to have yards open, people engaged telling cars as well as by the way, actual sales results at auction which demonstrate the superior economic outcome. So, literally buying cars on the platform, they're using and trading a profit on the ground in Germany to buyers outside of Germany, in many cases is the most compelling argument of all. Which is not a Germany, can be like the U.S. is that Germany on February 19, 2020 February 20 is delivering auction of X, Y, Z. So the conversations have advanced in part for that reason. Operator : Our next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. I wanted to ask you guys about the comments you made about technology. Clearly, you guys have led the industry for a long time on that front. And when I think about kind of the last few years, I feel like you guys have made some nice upgrades to the buying and selling applications. I was hoping to understand from a technology the endpoint where you guys are pushing the envelope? One area that kind of I've always thought about and we talked about that potentially could create service benefits would be if titling with the states could become a little bit more seamless and maybe you guys could develop applications there. So, just trying to understand on the back-end side of things, what technology can bring to the industry? And that said, if you bring technology into the industry, potentially cars move quicker, does that a road some of the economics that you guys have been able to benefit from associated with the storage and the vehicle for the extended period of time? Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. My answer to you probably be similar to what I said to Bob, which is that that is a non-stock investment for us when there is technology to improve outcomes, in particular for our sellers. And for them, outcomes means, in the ordinary course, shortening cycle times, allowing them to close claims more quickly selling the cars -- well, titling them we're treating the original titles processing the salvage side of state more quickly and therefore auctioning network quickly to a global liquid platform. That there are literally dozens of steps in that process, each of which has its own process and technology to do best for us internally. So the answer your question, broadly, yes, the technology is by far our single biggest Copart investment here besides our land. If you were literally to walk through Copart headquarters and meet with group by group you find the technology group is overwhelming just a numbers and resorts expenditures. So, it has been a huge part of what we do, we talk about it, frankly more with our sellers than we do on calls like this, but it is our single biggest Copart investment. John Healy : And I might have missed it, but I probably did. Did you guys mention what inventories were at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Jeff Liaw : Inventories [Technical Difficulty] 7% year-over-year. Operator : Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Jay, a quick clarifier on your opening comments. Talking about capacity growth and incremental market share. Are you seeing incremental market share out there today? Are there any large contracts coming up for RFP in the next year or was that just to comment on kind of overall strategy and recent trends? Jay Adair : Well, we never get into specific clients or talking about, whether they're up to tender after RFP. But we have succeeded historically at having market share wins and the point I was making is twofold, one that we have the capacity to do that going forward and the second was I anticipate that trend will continue. I think the other thing I was going to add on the previous question, there was a comment about whether or not if we sell vehicles quicker, if that would be detrimental from a storage standpoint. And for the most part, we benefit when vehicles are sold quicker. Our goal -- just so that all the investors understand, our goal is to move those vehicles as quickly as possible for the customer services vehicle generates a higher return and storage or storing vehicles an insignificant part of the business. So, I wanted to just add some clarity on that. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. And then, Jeff, maybe a follow-up, you continue to call out a benefit from this mix shift within non-insurance towards dealer and off ways away from municipality and charity. How far along in that mix shift are we? Should that continue or have we largely phased out a lot of the legacy municipality charity toward that should be more steady state, kind of, going forward? What's the right mix longer term, strategically? Jeff Liaw : Complicated question. We of course value our customers across all of these categories. We just also do face somewhat some resource constraints from time to time and to make decisions accordingly. I would think of that shift as largely complete. And we don't want -- the best level of detail we can get into what happened which quarter and how did this quarter took to remodel year-over-year. But I would think that -- I think about is largely complete. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. And then just one last one from me. Historically, if we look at warm winters 2012-2017 there does tend to be some negative impact on volume growth in the coming quarters just due to less accident frequency, are you guys thinking that this winter should have any kind of impact on your results today in the back half of the year or industry dynamic strong enough to where we should really see that show up in this business. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Yes, it's a very fair question. We tend -- with the exception of, of course, extreme weather events, we tend not to talk about whether because it sometimes feels like it's to both difficult to quantify and becomes an explanation of that could become an excuse for factors in the business. I do agree with you that it was by all measures, a benign winter higher temperatures lower precipitation at least across the United States and that, yes, therefore, that generally means fewer claims at the top of the funnel quantifying that precisely, I don't know. Inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year nonetheless. So, whether that was depressed by temperatures precipitation is a judgment probably better left to others and to me personally. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good afternoon. Jeff, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the call it the pricing or revenue per unit side of the equation. I think you called out another quarter of ASP growth. But on a year-over-year basis maybe is a little bit slower from some historical trends. I think some are kind of calling for some declines and used vehicle pricing this year. I don't know if that's going to materialize or not, but maybe if you could speak to that side of the equation on the pricing and revenue per unit side and what you're seeing in the market. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : In that, I think you're asking really about two different economics phenomenon, one of which is the selling prices for our cars at auction. That itself is a function of both cyclical and secular forces, some of which you mentioned is cyclical x variables that can affect selling prices of cars our auctions of course include used car prices, as you noted, currency fluctuations and the like, among other things. The second, of course, is we think are that total loss frequency rises, and as total loss frequency rises, we get more marginal totals, more drivable cars that would drive ASPs up. So the combination of the two over the very long haul, we think will drive ASPs up in any individual quarter or year, month, week, day, etc. The projects become perhaps too fine to pass all of those variables. But generally speaking, we believe the secular tailwinds are ultimately net debt. The second part of your question on revenue per unit, that's not something per se that we express we disclose. We of course drive revenue -- we drive unit volume as much as we can. Revenue growth also with the addition of services we provide to both sellers and buyers. Stephanie Benjamin : And then I just had a clarification, I know that\u2019s twice, I apologize for hearing it but on Germany, did you say that you were testing some consignment models are testing that consignment model with some carriers in Germany or did I miss that twice. So just a clarification. Jeff Liaw : We have sold cars on a consignment basis insurance carriers in Germany. That said, we also continue to purchase cars through our principal activity is continuing as well as we build the physical infrastructure people-based and technology and talents to serve that industry long-term. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. When you think about the inventory growth in the quarter and you had some pretty big share gains last year, is there any way to look at what was the contribution from new customers versus what was core legacy-ish inventory growth? Jeff Liaw : I would characterize -- well, I think that's a level of detail, we probably would get into. But I would, the way characterize it is that there was both underlying market growth as well as market share gains in that year-over-year number. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And I guess we don't talk about of scrap pricing anymore, but do you see any impact, I guess from the Chinese market demand, relative to what's going on with Corona virus? Is there any pending volatility on scrap price there? Jeff Liaw : I'll answer in two parts. Scrap price maybe effect on Copart I would say is largely de minimis. So the Chinese buyers in part for regulatory reasons but are a very tiny portion of our overall sales below percent when I last year. So they're are not insignificant buyer of Copart cars. That said, Corona virus, obviously, will not necessarily observe specific national borders. So, if it spreads there could be in effect downstream but today's no. Bret Jordan : Okay and then just one question on Germany, what's the total acreage there? I guess when you think about the yard size in Germany, I think about being somewhat smaller than the U.S. yard. So, I guess is it better to think about it in acres versus locations? Jeff Liaw : Probably so, though not something we would discuss. Yes, we are investing in acreage. I think your intuition generally is correct and that our yards would be smaller today in part because we needed to get going. The lead time here in the U.S. and for that matter in Germany to develop acre parcel for vehicle storage is long and we work like to wait to do that. So, we had gotten achieved operations in a number of facilities there more quickly by starting with smaller facilities and some cases mixing [ph] them. Operator : Our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Good morning, Jay and Jeff, how are you? Hey, could you tell me, just as a percentage of the vehicles you're selling, insurance versus noninsurance, how is that mix changed. I mean, what is the current percentage now versus where it was maybe last year? Jeff Liaw : The current percentage is approximately 2a% and I think a year ago, it was a little bit north of that. There was some seasonality to it -- but not year-over-year. It's not seasonality. So a year ago was 22% I believe and now is 21%. And that's partially a function of the shift within non-insurance that we just talked about a moment ago. Gary Prestopino : And as you -- one could assume that most of the growth there is dealer cars. Correct? If the growth is for dealer cars. Jeff Liaw : That is a meaningful source of the growth in our non-insurance business. Yes. Gary Prestopino : Do you have the capability, and I probably should know this, but I'm asking the question, with the dealer car, do you have the capability to sell it at the lot, their lot or do you have to take it to one of your facilities to sell it? Jeff Liaw : So, there are, let's say, probably the safest way to -- the best way to characterize it is that we are exploring multiple ways to service those automotive dealers. I think clearly from their perspective today, our principal value proposition is the buyer base that we offer in comparison to other offerings in the marketplace. For example, we have a global buyer base. We already have the post booking from all over the world and that is the value we offer. And how we deliver that and whether physically we require as deep or not, those are all variables that are relatively simpler to manage, quite candidly, Gary. But I think the value proposition side, I think it's clear and how we deliver it we are experimenting with a number of different avenues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : Thank you for taking the question. I actually had a follow-up on the non-insurance business and specifically your relationship with independent dealers. I'm curious how the vehicles sourced from them or that purchased by them at your auctions differ from their own core inventory offering at retail. Are there any key differences in terms of age or quality? I'm just trying to get a better sense for how they're leveraging your platform. Jeff Liaw : I think the trends would be hard to draw very broad sweeping ones, but I'd say in general, of course, if they do there tends to specialized X and receives a trading and brand Y, that would be a natural car too to process through a Copart or consign to Copart auction. But I think you finance are all over the map and automotive dealers sometimes simply wants to achieve near-term liquidity and cosign a number of cars through us, so you will see a wide range sometimes damaged cars often in tax cars that are perfectly drivable, sometimes both cars under facilities, sometimes newer ones as well. It's tough to provide rules on that. Operator : Thank you. This is the last call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Chris [ph] with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. A question for you on the European rollout. So it sounds like you have -- you are proving out the capabilities and the data to the insurers right like with actual data and actual service. So, besides like the right type of highly regulated industry like what are the other friction points that are preventing insurers from acting more quickly given what's presumably compelling data? And then two, once they've made that decision, how long is it take for them to like changes that disposition model and on board? What's kind of the timeline of conversion once they've decided that this model's a better model? Jeff Liaw : I think the single biggest barrier, Chris, is simply inertia, which is that it's been an insurance industry that is accustomed to a set of historical practices literally for decades, from their interactions with their policyholders all the way back through claims. So the practice habits are difficult to break. We do believe that when carriers shift meaningful volume in this direction and improve the policyholder experience, that there certainly should be some momentum built that causes it to accelerate from there. But speculating as to exactly what that conversion time frame is tough to do. But the barrier I think is more habits than anything else. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. That's helpful. And then can you help us think through kind of the CapEx, the implications of CapEx on kind of yard op cost? I mean, the CapEx has been super robust lately, but how does that translate near-term? Is there [indiscernible] to lag, or how do you basically translate the CapEx to yard up cost in the coming quarters or years for that matter? Jeff Liaw : I think if you had access to literally every data point inside our company, that would be too noisy a correlation to try to draw. So CapEx, I'll just give you some directional indications. CapEx, when we open a new facility is net helpful because we -- certainly the new site is closer to some of the seem to be accidents or the repair shops where the cars are being retrieved from. So, we would achieve immediate savings in terms of the retrieval of the vehicles. We may achieve savings because there are yards that are very congested nearby, and therefore are incurring extra labor costs and the likes to manage the vehicles inside the facility. However, of course, opening new facilities incurs some level of quote fixed costs, including utilities, and telecom, management's labor, and the like. So, there are puts and takes. I would say across the system, the CapEx, we are opening enough new facilities, expanding enough current facilities, and have done so very steadily, that the effect in any given quarter won\u2019t be that pronounced. It\u2019s one reason you don't hear us discuss -- we don't explain gross margin variations or cost variations because a facility\u2019s newly opened. It's now a big enough set of facilities that the opening of any given set in a quarter does not affect the financials visibly any way from where you sit. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. That's very helpful. All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Daniel Imbro : Yes, thanks, guys. I actually have a follow-up. Jeff, a quick follow-up on the European market commentary. While the car park is similar, I believe alternative part usage is lower, particularly in collision repair in Europe. So, I guess the question is, is there an existing collision salvage market place in Europe to support traditional salvage volumes, or would the units you sell over in Germany -- or what you're selling in Germany more of the run and drive vehicles today? Jeff Liaw : Industry observation I think is fair, which is that alternative parts utilization in Europe is considerably lower than here in the U.S. That said, there are clearly cars that economically should not be repaired, and so even within Europe today, they we will find a home one way or the other. There are cars that are 110%damage, which you could not possibly justify the repair cost restored back to [Technical Difficulty]. The economic value proposition for the carriers is that we can help them achieve full and fair value for those salvaged vehicles, whether it will ultimately fuel dismantling, or simply be scrapped altogether, or be rebuilt and re-driven again somewhere else. We simply help the carriers to achieve that full fair liquid market value, as opposed to today's traditional pattern of disposition which don't do that. But I think your industry observation is fair. But nonetheless, there are still are many cars that are totaled in Europe today. Daniel Imbro : Makes total sense. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to the speakers for closing remarks. Jay Adair : Okay, thank you, Samantha. Thank you, everyone, for attending the call. We look forward to reporting Q3 in the next quarter. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, you guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Copart Conference Call. At this time. I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Liaw, President of Copart. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Liaw : Thank you, Dan. I'll start today's call with the safe harbor before turning it over to Jay for opening remarks. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the certain discrete income tax items, disposal of nonoperating assets, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. And the effect on common equipment from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including forward-looking statements concerning management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, uncertainties, including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The current worldwide pandemic could adversely affect our financial results in future periods based on declines in accident volume and other pandemic-related factors, and our business and operating results are generally subject to additional uncertainties such as dependence on our major vehicles, sellers, business risks relating to our international expansion strategies, factors affecting average selling prices for auction vehicles and the additional risks identified under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our annual on Form 10-K for the years ended July 31, 2019, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on our Form 10-Q, any forward-looking statement as of today, and Copart has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  With that, CEO, Jay Adair. Jayson Adair : Thanks, Jeff. You're breaking up just a little bit on that. So maybe we should dial in. Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. Jayson Adair : I'll go ahead and kick off. Yes. Perfect. Again, welcome, everyone. Thanks for coming to the third quarter call. If I were to describe Copart, at the beginning of the quarter, I would say, full speed ahead. We were acquiring land, developing that property, winning business, selling record units, record number of units company-wide. And if I were to fast forward a month later to the beginning of March, the best way I could describe us would be unpredicted but prepared.  Clearly, looking at COVID, and it was all day, every day COVID in the first week of March, by the time we got to the second week of March, I had reached out to some friends of mine that are in the service industry, people that own hair salons, people that own restaurants. And the government had not yet told anyone to specifically not go to work or to specifically not open up their business, but just the rhetoric that was coming out of the news and out of Washington was enough to keep people from going out to dinner and to keep people from traveling, and so we saw that company-wide. We saw, overnight, our customers couldn't travel. Overnight, we had to cancel conferences and cancel events that we had planned. And this was -- we had, at this point, gone from what I would say, unpredictable to a position where who could anticipate that the government would actually be thinking of shutting down business.  And my concern was really about the behavior of people. And so I reached out to some political contacts that I've got. And I quickly came away from those meetings thinking they're going to actually shut business down. And obviously, the country has been through a number of experiences over the years, whether it be polio, whether it be Spanish flu, and we haven't been in that situation where we think business is going to be shut down. We saw that not just in the U.S. but coming out of Italy, the U.K. I think the U.S. was probably a little earlier on than the U.K. from the results I've seen. But in the end, the U.K. definitely shut down much harder than the U.S. did. But regardless, this was really, really unpredictable at that point. But as I said, very prepared. So first thing we did, this felt a little bit like the '08 financial crisis. We weren't sure if there was going to be liquidity at banks. So the first thing Copart did, not knowing the future, not knowing exactly how we were going to have to position ourselves, we pulled down in excess of $800 million on our line. And at that point, we had over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We, subsequent to that, reached out to all of our employees. We put together the first of what would be a number of phone calls that were company-wide phone calls with all of our management and all of the fields. We recorded the calls so we could play them back. And this was really about setting people's fears aside. I mean, the fear of COVID is something we can't control, but your financial security is something we could control and these were precarious times. So we reached out and let everyone know that we had a lot of cash. Can you hear me okay? Okay. We reached on, let everyone know that we have a lot of cash and that -- 1 second here. Can you hear me on the call all right? Operator : Yes, sir. Please proceed. Jayson Adair : We've got issues there, then Jeff will come in here. Okay. All right. So I'll continue. We just -- we've got some -- Jeff and I are in 2 different locations, obviously, because of COVID. They can hear me fine. You can all hear me, but apparently Jeff's having trouble. So he's going to get on and he'll continue. But just to continue on that note, we made it very clear that Copart had a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet. We could operate for months or we could survive for months without operating, without being able to pick up cars, without being able to sell cars. Now clearly, that's going to be a problem for the nation. That's going to be a problem for the U.S., the U.K. and other markets we work, and I'll get into that. But the initial messaging to our company was that we are strong, that there will be no furloughs for 90 days, that there will be no reduction of hours and that this is about continuity. This is about Copart making sure that we can provide the services for our customers. And the way to do that is to give the people at Copart confidence so that they can deliver on that promise, and that's exactly what we did.  As I said, we started off the quarter full speed ahead, and we didn't want to change from that position. So we've continued throughout the quarter to acquire land. We've continued throughout the quarter to develop that land. We think this is necessary to the long-term success of Copart. We believe that this is a temporary reduction of volume. We're already seeing that. Jeff will talk about that a little more, but we're already seeing that volume coming back. But that was really Message one.  Message two was this new concept of essential business, and this is not -- clearly, this is something none of us have thought about before. And if you were to speak to some of my friends that run businesses, if you speak to some of my friends that work at businesses, they all feel their businesses are essential. They're essential to their family. They're essential to their success. And so conceptually, it was hard to understand that the government would be, at the state level, at the federal level, at the city level, telling businesses not to operate. And I actually made an argument at that point with some of the politicians that I'm connected with or friends with, that let's look at quarantining high risk and let's look at -- if they've got preexisting conditions. And then let's look at trying to parse the population so that 1/4 of us are at work or 1/3 of us are at work or 1/2 of us are at work so we can maintain social distancing, similar to what I would say we're doing now as a company.  So throughout this experience, we had multiple times where law enforcement tried to shut down Copart locations, both in the U.S. and internationally, in the U.K., and throughout all those experiences, our team rallied, and we made the arguments that are very clear. If Copart doesn't pick up cars from tow companies, they're going to get full and the streets are going to have cars left on them. And if Copart doesn't sell vehicles, we're not going to have parts available for repair. We don't pick up cars from body shops. You're not going to have body shops able to fix cars. You're not going to have insurance companies able to pay off insureds, and it's going to stop the insurance process. So we made very strong arguments in multiple states, and there was a couple of scenarios where we've shut down for a day or 2, and we were able to reverse that by working with chiefs of police, and other folks in law enforcement were able to reverse that and get back open. I'm happy to say all of Copart's locations, for the most part, have been open, for the most part, meaning we were down for a day and then back up, maybe down for a day or 2 and then back up. So we have essentially been running through this whole quarter picking up vehicles, although less, and Jeff will talk about that, and we've been selling off a lot of inventory throughout this process.  So as I said, very unpredictable but very prepared. This was something that, internally, we have reflected on this and dealing with DMVs that have shut down and trying to work with those DMVs so that they continue while they're shut down to the general public and on the retail front, we tried to work with them to continue to process titles in the back so that we can get these vehicles sold. Fortunately for us, we've had a large capacity. As we've been adding land over the years, we've developed a lot of land, developed a lot of capacity. So we've got room at our facilities. We did things. There's some increased costs in the quarter because we did things like move vehicles from 1 yard to another yard in anticipation of DMVs being shut down to ensure that we have enough room at that facility if we had to keep picking cars up and not be able to sell those vehicles. And then finally, I'd make the argument that we continue to express that we are a company that has, for the last 17 years, sold everything online. And so a lot of the states made the argument that if you're completely online, you can stay open. That was another one of our arguments that we utilized, and we've had the benefit of buyers being able to look online and bid online and then send trucks in to pick up the vehicle.  So it's -- overall, it's been a very unpredictable experience. I, really, second week of March, didn't think I'd be, 8 weeks later, seeing jobless claims of 36.5 million. I just didn't -- I wasn't convinced that the government was going to actually be as aggressive as shutting business down across the country. We all know that, that's been the case, and we all know what's happened over that period of time. Our team has really, really rallied. The IT folks, though not all at the office because of social distancing, have continued to deliver technology. We've adjusted, we've course-corrected on the fly and changed the services, how we offer those services, the technology we use to offer those services, and our folks in the field have done a phenomenal job every single day coming to work, making sure we unload trucks, put cars away, set sales -- sell cars, load customers out, et cetera.  And so one of the things we've said internally is while we didn't anticipate this pandemic, the folks at Copart were built for this. We have really done a great job as a company. And for those Copart folks out there that are listening to this call, as your CEO, you guys have done a phenomenal job. No, actually, you guys have kicked ass, and I'm proud of everything you've done. And it's -- this is one of those experiences that will go down in the history books for me, and I couldn't be more prouder of the success and the way we've handled this pandemic. On that note, I'll turn it over to our President, Jeff Liaw, to give you an update on the quarter. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks. Thank you, Jay. We'll start the remarks with a deviation from our usual script and offer some comments on the COVID-19 crisis following Jay's narrative and its effect on our business, specifically how the coronavirus has affected our operations, our priorities and our financial results.  On operations, as Jay noted, beginning in March of 2020, our business and operations began to experience the interruption worldwide, first, within our European operations and as the month progressed and the quarter progressed throughout the balance of our global operations. As Jay noted, in materially all of our jurisdictions, we've been deemed by local authorities an essential business because we helped to ensure the removal of vehicles from repair shops and impound yards, streets and highways, enabling the critical function of our world's road infrastructure. We're proud of the role our people play in serving the communities in which we do business, and the work we do will enable the smooth functioning of our societies during the crisis and certainly support our eventual recovery from it as well. We've taken great care to follow appropriate health and safety protocols in all of our facilities to ensure safe working conditions for our employees as well as for our sellers, buyers and other business partners with whom we come into contact.  We've also adapted, in many cases, to remote work arrangements and have experienced no material disruptions to our business. We frequently and proactively communicate with our customers as well. And in many respects, we're simply continuing business as usual. For example, our facilities remain fully operational as well as the online-only auctions Jay noted a moment ago. Because we've operated exclusively online auctions now for 17 years and have made iterative refinements and more transformative overhauls over the years, we've not experienced any disruptions in any way in terms of how we sell cars. And we continue to believe that our auction technology drives the best-in-class experience for our members and best-in-class returns for our sellers as well.  Turning to our priorities. It won't surprise you that our near-term priorities are on our customers, in many cases, adapting real-time to their own workflow modifications and accommodating their remote work arrangements. We've deployed new technologies in support of those accommodations as well. Our long-term focus is, again, on investing in international member recruitment and retention. Our auction liquidity is sacrosanct and enables our business to grow. We are focused keenly on extending our technology advantage in every respect, both in terms of our auctions as well as the many ways we interact with our sellers, our members and the various aspects of our ecosystem.  We are investing aggressively in our future also in terms of capital expenditures in support of capacity. We believe there isn't any such thing as noncritical capital expenditures. If they were noncritical, we never would have made them in the first place. We'd note we spent more in capital expenditures this past quarter than we did in all of fiscal 2015 in support of ours and our customers' future growth. We'll be opportunistic as we look forward in acquiring still more capacity to serve our customers.  We are investing in our people as well. We continue to recruit, train and promote our team members. We have not furloughed employees or suspended 401(k) contributions. We have said before and fundamentally believe that our people are one of our most critical assets. And while we will always be prudent stewards of our business, we won't make shortsighted decisions that affect our ability to serve our customers well. We want to be prepared to serve them and their growth and our growth as well and, of course, to be prepared for a potentially active tropical storm season ahead.  Then the coronavirus effect on our financial results. It won't surprise you that our operating results for the quarter were affected by lower processed vehicle volume. We received and sold fewer vehicles in the quarter than we had anticipated due, of course, to the pandemic. The volume declines in turn were due to fewer accidents occurring as a result of fewer miles being driven in response to state and national shelter-in-place orders. We track a range of industry sources, including Apple Mobility, Google, the University of Washington's Metrics, among many others. And we would note that from the baseline, it appears that driving activity troughed at down 55% to 65% relative to the pre-coronavirus levels during certain periods in the quarter, though we also note that activity has increased substantially from that trough level. And then compared to apparent reductions in driving activity, our assignment volume has not been affected as severely, not nearly so, a function of driving behavior and total loss frequency. On driving behavior, because the roads are less congested, it appears that drivers are often driving faster and perhaps with more distractions still. Total loss frequency has increased according to most industry sources. That's been caused by a mix of repair shop disruptions, which have affected their ability to service automobiles and also insurance carrier decisions on remote work and wanting to simplify the loss claims process as opposed to having adjusters with the vehicles, policyholders recover vehicles after repairs.  We've also noted some volatility in selling prices for vehicles at our auctions, though we would note also that liquidity and auction participation has remained high throughout the crisis. Selling prices in more recent days after the end of the quarter have actually reached levels higher than pre-crisis levels. The price volatility during the quarter, we would attribute in part to substantially strengthened U.S. dollar, and therefore, the currencies that often purchase -- or the countries that often purchase cars at our auctions have had seen their purchasing power somewhat impaired as a result. There, of course, has also been a global economic uncertainty, which has affected demand for vehicles as well and, finally, some potential logistics challenges or uncertainties regarding the exported vehicles. But by and large, the auctions have -- auction liquidity has remained quite strong. On our own financial liquidity, as we noted in our 8-K issued in March, we drew down $825 million in funds under our available revolving credit facility, in part in response to what we perceived as systemic uncertainty. We've subsequently repaid all of those outstanding borrowings under our facilities. And as of April 30, 2020, we had approximately $1.1 billion of available liquidity, including $300 million of cash in the undrawn facility I just described. Our conservative capitalization, we think, enables us to continue to make decisions for the long-term benefit and interest of our customers and our shareholders.  Looking forward then on the coronavirus, we expect the pandemic to have, of course, an adverse effect on our quarterly revenues in future quarters, with magnitude and timing of those effects, dependent on the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets as well as the potential resumption of shelter-in-place orders. The longer-term impact on our business will depend on the development of the pandemic, society's responses to those developments and the potential availability of vaccines and treatments, of course, none of which we can predict. In short, our approach to the pandemic is that it's a massive disruption to the global economy and the markets we serve but not a permanent structural shift. If and when the facts indicate otherwise and that we are facing such a structural shift in either ways that reduced demand for our services, for example, permanent remote work arrangements that reduce daily commuting or in ways that increase demand for our services, for example, the substitution of automotive transport for public transit and air travel, we'll adjust accordingly. As we discuss our financial results, we'll share the customary metrics that we provide every quarter. Before the crisis, the themes we've discussed in the past had largely continued, as Jay noted in his opening remarks. Meaningful increases in unit sales, in insurance, in noninsurance, in assignments, average selling prices, bidding activity, international bidding activity and so forth. So the metrics we'll share, of course, include a blend of pre -- and precrisis and crisis input. Turning to the third quarter. We experienced global revenue decline of 0.5% or $2.8 million year-over-year. That includes an unfavorable currency effect of $3.6 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollars -- of the U.S. dollar, pardon me, as well as a shift of a particular customer from a purchase arrangement to a consignment engagement you've heard us describe before. Global service revenue grew $17.9 million or 3.8% year-over-year, which, as we've noted before, is a more accurate reflection of the underlying economic activity in our business. That, in turn, reflects growth in the U.S. at 3.6% in service revenues and international service revenue growth of 5.1%. We did experience a purchased vehicle decline of $20.7 million or 26% as growth in the U.S. was more than offset by the international decline we noted a moment ago, primarily driven again by the shift of the U.K. customer to a fee-based sales contract. On unit growth, we experienced global unit sales decrease of just under 1%. We'll provide more color momentarily with a U.S. increase -- U.S. unit increase of 1.4% and an international unit decline of 12.6%. The U.S. unit growth has been driven by organic growth from our existing insurance customers and market share gains. Insurance grew 5.6% in units sold for the quarter. Noninsurance declined 13.4%, though if you exclude the charities and wholesale business, our noninsurance business actually grew year-over-year for the quarter. Prior to the crisis, as one important group that we track, our dealer consignment volumes actually had continued their double-digit growth rates year-over-year. Our noninsurance business, of course, has been meaningfully affected by COVID-19. We believe we have outperformed other auto auction businesses during the crisis, in part, because we have been a natively digital business for almost 20 years and because of our auction liquidity. Turning to global inventory. Worldwide, our inventory declined 9.6% with U.S. inventory declining 11.3% and international inventory growth of positive 1.2%. Our inventory declined as auctions consumed inventory, which was then replenished at reduced rates. Our gross profit declined from $251.6 million to $242.6 million or a 3.6% decline year-over-year. Our gross margin rate declined slightly from 45.5% to 44.1%. In the U.S., we experienced a gross margin contraction of 50.2% to 46.3% as our yards remained open throughout the pandemic with lower-than-expected unit sales and assignment volumes. Our international gross margins increased from 25.4 to 31.7 due in part to operating efficiencies and also in part to the shift of that customer from a principal arrangement to a consignment. In the U.S. and globally, we do note rising for unit processing cost a reflection of negative operating leverage from fewer units sold and fewer units received than we had previously anticipated. Turning to selling prices for the quarter. Within the U.S., we experienced a decline in average selling prices year-over-year for the full quarter of 4.8%. Prior to the crisis, we had observed increases in selling prices within the quarter. And since the end of the quarter, we have seen prices rise to above pre-crisis levels. As I noted a moment ago, the volatility in the quarter has been due in part to currency effects as well as logistics and demand uncertainty. Even with this unprecedented global dislocation, our international member base remains critical to our auction liquidity and outcomes. We actually increased unique international bidders in the quarter by almost 20% year-over-year and observed increases in bids by international members and increases in bids per unit sold. The outcome, of course, is higher bids per unit and, therefore, better selling prices for our customers as we drive enhanced auction liquidity. I'll turn now to general and administrative expenditures. In general, as we've noted before, G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time. We continue to believe that we can achieve operating leverage over time. As with all trended data in our business, gross margins, G&A, unit sales and so forth, we'd encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than the single quarter metrics for a more accurate view of the business. Our GAAP operating income declined from $207.5 million to $195.1 million for the quarter. Our net interest expense increased 9.7% year-over-year due largely to the drawn revolver for a portion of the quarter, partially offset by lower interest rates as well. Other income of positive $2.3 million was attributable to earnings from a nonconsolidated equity method investment, currency gains and asset disposal gains. In the third quarter, we -- our provision for taxes was $44.3 million, which includes the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options, which has been reflected as such in the non-GAAP earnings reconciliation. Our GAAP net income decreased from $192.7 million a year ago to $147.5 million this year and our non-GAAP net income declined from $154.9 million to $138.3 million for the quarter. Turning then to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with just north of $300 million in cash on the balance sheet and just north of $100 million in net debt, leaving us essentially unlevered. We adopted a new lease standard this year in the first quarter, which shows $106.6 million operating lease right-of-use assets and $109.1 million of operating lease liabilities on our balance sheet. On cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter was robust at $294 million, an increase versus the third quarter of '19 and a substantial increase versus the second quarter as well. This is driven in part by the cash flow generated from the business as well as the working capital reductions that come with the decline in inventory. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, $90.6 million. Again, more than 80% of our CapEx was attributable to investing in capacity expansion. We have a number of new yards and expansion projects in the queue as well. We continue our efforts to purchase and develop land to meet current and prospective demand. With that, I'll turn the mic back to the operator who can begin taking questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question in queue. This one comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick : I just want to start off where you kind of finished the prepared remarks as it relates to the land. You talked about, earlier in the remarks, the 2 potential impacts on longer term on miles driven. Could be more work from home could reduce miles driven or if fewer people are taking mass transit or flying, there could be an increase. So how do you -- obviously, I don't expect you to know the answer to what the outcome will be in that regard. How does that impact your land strategy right now? And then just as it relates to that, too, is there enough activity going on that you can find more land? Is that -- is it easier or harder now as a result of the economy to purchase land, if you wanted? Jeffrey Liaw : Very good question, Bob. In short, I think you're right that those big societal questions, I think, will remain to be resolved over the months, quarters and years ahead. On land investments, the lead times for acquiring and developing land are quite long. Our expectation is that we will use that land to accommodate our customers' growth and our own for a multiple-year horizon. So it's not a 1-month, 18-month, even a 3-year decision. We acquire land because it makes sense over a 5- to 20-year horizon.  We continue our activity. I think your intuition is fair in that in some respects, our ability to do so has been perhaps limited in some cases where economic activity or regulatory approvals have stalled because of the virus impact. In other cases, though, the crisis may unlock opportunities for us to move forward because land is now available at more reasonable values where local jurisdictions are still more excited about having the jobs that a new Copart facility brings with it. So I think in short, we have not meaningfully disrupted or changed our strategic approach to land acquisitions, and we wouldn't do so based on anything that happens over a 6- to 10-week horizon. As we noted in the opening remarks, if the facts unfold differently going forward, we'll, of course, revisit. But for now, no change in our course. Robert Labick : Got it. Great. And then we've talked a little bit on previous calls about your work with carriers on optimizing the total loss process, and you noted total loss frequency seems to have ticked up recently as well, and we've seen that in some publications as well. Can you just expand on what value you can add to the carriers now in the total loss process, given your increased data that you've been collecting for so many years? Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. And good question, Bob. I think we talked about that a couple of quarters ago, and I misunderstood your question last quarter. But in short, we believe that providing more data to our insurance carrier partners and earlier in their own loss claims process will help them make more informed decisions and, in many cases, will empower them to total cars more quickly, which saves them the processing burden, storage costs and repair shops, uncertainty regarding the loss claims resolution with our own policyholders. So for us, it is amassing the data that comes from having sold tens of millions of vehicles over the years and being able to value them efficiently and quickly based on limited data sets available to us at that moment in time and sharing that data in ways that empower those carriers to make the decisions more quickly. That's what we meant a couple of quarters ago, and that work certainly continues to pace. Robert Labick : Okay. Super. And then last one for me, I'll jump back in queue. And just shifting gears a little bit. Can you give us an update on Germany? Has the economic impact over there or anything else impacted insurance carriers' decisions to convert to the U.S.-style auction? How are things going? And just a general update. Jeffrey Liaw : I think in broad strokes, we continue to move forward there as well. So we've invested and continue to invest in land and in people and technologies. Our dialogues with the insurance carriers continue to be very productive. I think we noted on the last call that we had begun selling consignment vehicles on behalf of insurance carriers there. This kind of disruption, I think, cuts -- the coronavirus cuts both ways. On the one hand, it's difficult nowadays to meet face-to-face, either among ourselves or with our customers or prospective customers. On the other hand, radical shifts like this also tend to open the mind to considering alternatives where the status quo is no longer the glide path that it once was. So I think it hasn't changed. Either way, I think our conviction that our long-term prosperity in Germany is there for us to pursue. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : I wanted to ask, to what extent did the pandemic reduce revenue in the quarter, knowing that revenue recognition can be something like 50 days after the loss event? So we would expect, I guess, the pandemic impact to be much more severe in the current quarter. Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. I think that observation's fair, and your question is difficult to answer. Your directional observation is fair. And the reason the question is difficult to answer is, you start to cut the data very, very finely, right? Where -- when do you consider the coronavirus start date to have happened in Oklahoma versus Louisiana versus So Paulo versus Toronto, right? So I think the directional impact is very hard to assess. And that's why we didn't get into very elaborate, pre- and post-metrics. It didn't -- it just wasn't worthwhile or clean enough to do so pre- and post. But yes, you're correct that given the leads and lags in our business, several weeks from when the accident happens to when the car's assigned to us and then a number of weeks again before we had the title processed and the car available for auction, that there is a lagging effect on our volume, yes. Craig Kennison : And then maybe -- I know you don't like to comment on the current quarter so much, but maybe just give a sense for what the last couple of weeks have looked like in terms of assignments versus last year. Are we meaningfully better as driving activity normalizes? Or still far below last year? Jeffrey Liaw : I think, Craig, I think we tend not to comment, as you know, on the current quarter. As I noted a few moments ago, we have seen assignment volumes, ASPs and so forth have certainly rebounded very meaningfully from the troughs. The year-over-year comparisons, we'll leave will be for when we talk about the quarter. Craig Kennison : Okay. And then just on inventory, that was a helpful metric that you always share, maybe not down as much as I had feared and actually up internationally. What's driving the international increase? Is that purely just internal secular trends that you've created through your growth initiatives? Or is that market kind of coming back sooner than maybe I had feared? Jeffrey Liaw : It's a fair question. I think there, yes, are secular forces that we talk about every quarter. In some cases, also, there have been interruptions outside the U.S. in DMV processing of titles. So you noted that the international unit sales were also down more than they were in the U.S. In some cases, that's because of inventory that's been hung outside U.S. as well. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue, comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : On the inventory question, and when you think about the trough in driving being the beginning of April and your month-end inventory being down around 11, would that, in theory, be maybe trough inventory in the sense that maybe an assignment takes a couple of weeks post-crash? And if driving has picked up, we'll be seeing inventory sequentially higher, do you think? Jeffrey Liaw : No. Not inventory, Bret. Trough assignments maybe, right? We are several weeks out from trough driving activity, but inventory itself is the accumulation of many weeks, months and, in some cases, years-old stuff. So that's a bigger layer cake, so to speak, that includes driving activity absent volume for loss frequency from a much longer period of time. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then on recent selling prices rebounding, is that on the back of domestic bids? Or is the foreign buyer back in the market pretty aggressively? Jeffrey Liaw : Both. There's meaningfully increased unique bidders and bids, both domestically and internationally. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a housekeeping question. I think Jay had mentioned that some of the costs associated with moving vehicles around logistically are due to DMV activity. Could you give us an idea how much expense was in the quarter around that? Jeffrey Liaw : I don't have a precise number to provide, Bret. I think it's -- I think in short, the moving of vehicles on logistics, in part, it was in fear, frankly, of us having vehicle stranded. So we wanted to make sure that our most congested yards would be able to continue to serve our customers. And so we move some cars at our expense within our own network. So I think that's what Jay was alluding to. But no, don't have a precise number to provide. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue, comes from Stephanie Benjamin, Robinson Humphrey. Stephanie Benjamin : I wanted to comment on some of the land acquisitions and the continued aggressive CapEx plans. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the geographic location or if you're targeting specific areas. Is this more domestic focused? International focused? What's the kind of general theme or geographies that you're looking at in terms of some of these expansions would be helpful. Jeffrey Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. A healthy mix of both is the answer. So a fair bit within perhaps our long-standing traditional markets in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., but also investments in Brazil, in Germany and elsewhere, so all of the above. And it's in pursuit of -- in support of our long-term growth, right, we can't stop the ship to wait for crystal clear certainty on what happens with driving activity and so forth. I think we fundamentally believe that we'll continue to drive auction liquidity. But the 50-year trends on total loss frequency will not abate on society's demand for mobility in general. Mobility isn't just commuting to work. It's also necessary for leisure, for health care, for education and that those 100-year trends really will continue perhaps with a meaningful interruption as it stands today. So believing those underlying principles, I think, leads us to want to invest to support our own growth and that of our customers. So I think it'd be irresponsible for us to arrest that process mid-course. Stephanie Benjamin : Absolutely. And then in terms of some of the comments you've made about certainly seeing some improvement across metrics from trough levels, is that true in terms of both the -- obviously, the U.S.? But internationally, are you seeing some of the same levels of trends? Jeffrey Liaw : In short, yes, with a fair bit of variability and a fair bit of uncertainty, right? So we track those metrics very carefully, but we also -- we'd be at risk of pretty meaningfully oversteering the business if we responded to daily traffic reports in the U.K. from Friday, right? That's not a good way to operate a business or make strategic decisions either. So we track those metrics. We have seen recovery in some cases. Certainly, some countries were later to shut down, and therefore, it will be later to reopen somewhere earlier and therefore, earlier, seeing the full gamut of activity, as you just described. Some folks are recovering more quickly and others more slowly. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue, comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Daniel Imbro : I just wanted to start on something you talked about on the dealer consignment side. You said it was stronger pre-crisis, obviously, probably slowed meaningfully given what you've heard from the channel during the crisis. How do you think that channel progresses and the health of that channel progresses from here just given the declines and reduction we've seen in used vehicle sales, both in the U.S. and globally? Jeffrey Liaw : A fair question. I think if the question is over the next 2 to 3 quarters, harder for me to answer. I think, over the long haul, I think we remain quite bullish about our ability to serve that market. The volumes in the near term, of course, impaired by reduced activity. Sure, folks are taking fewer trade-ins. They're trafficking less in vehicles, period. So there are fewer that makes sense to route -- to consign in Copart. Over the long haul, though, our auction liquidity, our international buyer base, the buying and selling of new and used cars, I think, will continue to capture a growing portion of that ecosystem. So our outlook, long term, certainly has not changed. As I noted a moment ago, I do think we have somewhat meaningfully outperformed other such auto auction platforms during the period, in part because we were never dependent on folks coming and having lunch at the auction facility and bidding live on cars. We have been natively digital for a long time, and I think it showed in the quarter. Daniel Imbro : Helpful. And then maybe a related question. Just on the impact used vehicle pricing, there is the positive dynamic as that falls to units with total loss rate going higher. There's a negative to that on revenue per unit. Can you help us just think through the puts and takes and kind of -- is it a net positive or net negative as we think about the changes in used vehicle prices? And then how that impacts maybe the next 12 to 24 months? Jeffrey Liaw : That's a fair and difficult question and one I've wrestled with now for 5 years. And you're correct, directionally speaking, that with softer used car prices, cars will total more easily, and we would see a unit volume improvement. With lower used car prices, however, all else equal, the selling prices for our cars would be reduced as well. And we would, therefore, all else equal, make less per car than we otherwise would. How those nets, I think we've struggled over the years to know what we, \"root for.\" I think as a CFO and as a financially oriented person, I know that we have hundreds of thousands of cars in inventory already, and I want to achieve the best possible selling price for those cars. So it's probably intuitively hard to read for declining asset values when you already have many of them. But that said, the unit volume effect would be real. If you saw a substantial decline in used car prices, our unit volumes would increase very meaningfully. And even over the past, say, 4 or 5 years, Dan, used car prices have remained robust and very robust relative to where industry analysts have forecasted that they would be 5 years ago. That has, no doubt, suppressed unit volume that otherwise would have come to Copart, which has been masked by other forces, total loss frequency, market share gains, let in by other forces that have made that somewhat invisible. But there's no doubt that robust prices have suppressed unit demand for our services. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Really helpful. And then if I can squeeze the last one in. Jeff, over the last 12 months, we've heard a lot more talk around the industry just about ancillary services, providing more for the insurance companies. Are there any services today that your customers are requesting that you don't provide? Or do you guys have a robust suite today that you think covers most of your insurance companies' needs? Jeffrey Liaw : I think tough to talk about customers in monolithic entities. Some of them certainly have an appetite for us to do more and to vertically integrate still more into what they do day to day, and we certainly have expanded our service offerings over the past year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and we do more and more for our insurance carrier partners. So yes, there are additional services that we offer and more services that we'll offer over time as well. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue comes from Derek Glynn with Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : In this call and in the past, you've discussed some positive tailwinds driving higher total loss frequency. At the same time, we're seeing higher ADAS attach rates on vehicles, which may reduce frequency at some point, and you've also increased exposure to noninsurance segments. I'm wondering if growing volumes in those noninsurance channels is a conscious effort perhaps to hedge yourself from an eventual decline in accident frequency. Is there any urgency to diversify the business? Jeffrey Liaw : A lot of different embedded questions in what you just posed. So I'll try to dissect them one by one. First, in terms of ADAS effect on frequency, I'd note a couple of things. One is that I think the working hypothesis is that it will eventually reduce accident frequency, and I think that's a reasonable hypothesis because safety technologies, for the past 50 years, have generally reduced accident frequency. That's been true for as long as Copart's been around with one short-term blip, I would say, between 2011 and '16 when accident frequency actually went up year-over-year. That was a function of the iPhone proliferating across society. So generally speaking, accident frequency does decline. ADAS, on the other hand, we think, will drive increases in total loss frequency, and those forces will offset one another. Over the course of history, total loss frequency has generally increased much more than accident frequency has decreased. ADAS, I think there's a very logical thread to walk from ADAS proliferation to total loss frequency because what makes cars safer tend to be the sensors on the perimeter of cars that are easily damaged, difficult and expensive to calibrate and will drive still more cars to be totaled. Specifically, on your question of our diversification into other segments, I wouldn't characterize it that way. It's not a risk mitigation measure so much as it is the byproduct of auction liquidity. As we have cultivated an international and domestic member base that increasingly is purchasing vehicles that have lighter and lighter damage, it begins to more heavily overlap the whole car universe as well, and therefore, the cars that dealers receive on trade-ins become more and more attractive at Copart. We immediately expose that car to buyers in Nigeria, in Honduras, in Poland, Lithuania, in Oklahoma, in Maine, and it is that liquidity which has enabled us to grow within the dealer segment. So it's not per se a desire to mitigate risk. It's a desire to grow the business, and ultimately, that incremental dealer car also then helps our insurance companies as well. Auction liquidity begets more liquidity and begets better option returns. Derek Glynn : Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And can you elaborate on what was your original intent and drawn down that amount of capital on the credit line. Was that solely a precautionary measure given the uncertain economic climate? Or was there anything perhaps more opportunistic you were thinking about doing in terms of other capital allocation priorities? I would appreciate some clarity there. Jeffrey Liaw : Sure. Fair question. That was more just a risk mitigation measure we took at a moment when the global economy and the financial system, there was enough uncertainty, and a low enough cost that it made sense for us to draw on the revolver. Know that we had the cash available to us should we have needed it. We still do, of course. Our revolving credit facility remains quite intact with first-tier banks funding. So we have conviction now that it is there when we need it, and that was all there was to it. Operator : We'll take our next question in queue. This comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Gary Prestopino : A couple of questions here. I was writing real fast. I'm trying to keep up. You said your noninsurance were down. Vehicles were down 13.4%. Is that correct? Jeffrey Liaw : Let me give you the precise decimal, but keep going. Gary Prestopino : Well, what I was trying to get at is, if you back out the charity cars, what were they? Down or up? Do you have that? Jeffrey Liaw : If you back out the -- as said the charities and wholesalers, we would have been positive, slightly positive, just north of 1% for the quarter. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That's fine. And then just kind of a hypothetical question here. Given how long it takes for the whole cycle of -- from accidents to assignments, et cetera, if hypothetically, the country opens up by, say, the middle of June, all right, obviously, Q4 is going to be challenged, and no fault of yours. It's just that's the way it is. But when do you think if the -- if the country were to open up by the end of June, when do you think things start to normalize? Is there -- does it take a quarter, two quarters, three quarters to get you back to where the growth level you were at before? Jeffrey Liaw : And you mean, Gary, in terms of our unit sales or revenue? Gary Prestopino : Yes. Just in general, yes. Exactly. And what I'm trying to get at is from the time the country starts opening up and you assume that every people are going to be driving, you're going to have the same level of accident, same level of total losses, how long does that take to flush through to your system where you start -- there is no real impact from the COVID situation in any given quarter? Jeffrey Liaw : The reason I paused, Gary, any given quarter, we sell cars that we were assigned that same quarter. So in the third quarter of 2020, we sold cars that we picked up in February, March and April. We also saw cars from the last -- a quarter before and the quarter before and the quarter before and 5 years before, literally, that layer cake that I described a few moments ago. So in terms of -- no quarter -- every quarter has some memory going forward. But I think it's several quarters really before you've got the meaningful burden because it's based on average several months for us to sell a car. Operator : Our next question in queue comes from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim Partners. Ali Faghri : A couple here. I guess, first, can you remind us about your cost structure, fixed versus variable and how we should think about decremental margins in a backdrop like the near term where volumes are declining meaningfully? It sounds like you aren't proactively taking costs out of the business, specifically in response to COVID, but I may be wrong. Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. A handful of questions, what you described there, too. In terms of the fixed and variable mix, that question always boils down to what your time horizon is, and over the long haul, all costs are variable. In the near term, the majority of costs are for semi-fixed, with the exception, for example, of selling costs. Selling costs tend to -- we incur them when we tow a vehicle and we don't when we don't. So I think in the near term, and as you heard us describe a few minutes ago, if we conclude that this is a structural shift, then we would consider meaningful changes. But otherwise, we will operate the business as is with the intent to serve our customers well through storm season and for the next 3, 5, 10 years as well. Ali Faghri : Got it. That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up here. You mentioned ASPs are above pre-COVID levels. Is that due to a supply-demand mismatch currently as buyers are returning to the market, but the supply of vehicles is still relatively limited, so perhaps it's more of a temporary trend? Jeffrey Liaw : It could be. I think that remains to be seen. I think there is -- that's what you -- the forces you just described a moment ago. Also if the economies recover, if folks had themselves -- chosen to sit it out a week or 2, they suddenly find themselves short in inventory or parts or cars rebuild or what have you, right? So there may be something of a catch-up effect, so to speak. But I think the long, long-term trends before this quarter, our ASPs had been up 13 consecutive quarters, and they won't go up every quarter for the rest of our lives, of course, but that general tailwind of auction liquidity, higher total loss frequency, better, younger cars, less damaged cars, those forces aren't going away anytime soon. Now what that means over a two week, four week, even a three quarter horizon, we don't concern ourselves with too much. What we focus on, of course, is how to drive those returns up on a multiyear basis. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question in queue comes from Stephanie Benjamin, Robinson Humphrey. Stephanie Benjamin : I just had one quick follow-up. I was hoping maybe you could speak to if you felt, really broadly speaking, if your insurance customers have looked to diversify their auction providers or have restructured some of their relationships or how they interact with their auction providers. Just any high-level comment would be helpful, just looking back the last year or several years. Jeffrey Liaw : No. I appreciate the question, Stephanie. And again, tough to generalize about our customers who are -- have many different ways of approaching the business. But in general, we focus all of our efforts on serving them well and generating the best possible auction returns and providing the best possible service in ordinary times and in crazy times like the ones we're in today. So over time, I think we have generally continued to earn and win the trust of our customers and have gained market share as a result. So I wouldn't say that I've heard that theme in general. I think the question is can we serve our customers well and can we persuade our prospective customers that we can serve them well. How the chess match works between sole sourcing multiple providers and so forth, I haven't heard any particular trends in one direction or the other. So long as we deliver Copart level service and Copart level auction returns to our customers, we'll let the chips fall where they may. And I think history has proven that, that has been a productive approach. Operator : Our next question in queue comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : I know you have historically provided investors with the split of insurance versus noninsurance cars. Are you also able to break out the percentage of salvaged versus non-salvaged or whole cars? I think the whole car split is materially lower than the noninsurance split. But I'm just wondering if -- given the decline in miles driven and accidents, if there is any ability to absorb yard capacity by taking on more whole cars, whether sold by dealers or other sources. Jeffrey Liaw : I think the second question is probably easier than the first. To your -- the second question, in part because we have invested so aggressively in capacity, we, by and large, can serve customers, can serve our dealer customers and our insurance customers wherever they want to do business with us. I think Jay talked about that at some length on our last earnings call as well. We have invested and we continue to invest so that we can always say yes when those opportunities present themselves.  So no, it's not that -- it's not the reduced driving activity and declines in insurance assignments would per se enable us to win more dealer business. It is that we drive excellent returns and service to them that allows us to do so, and the land is our problem. We'll figure that out in the background so that we can serve them flawlessly. Operator : Speakers, there are no more questions in queue at this time. Jayson Adair : All right. Appreciate everyone coming on the call, and we look forward to reporting on Q4 in the fiscal year 2020, and wish everybody stay safe, and we'll talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jay Adair, Chief Executive Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please, go ahead, sir. Jay Adair : Thank you, Casey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'd like to pass over to Jeff Liaw, our President, to do the safe harbor and then we'll go ahead and give you an update on the quarter. Jeff? Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Jay. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, disposal of non-operating assets, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends opportunities and uncertainties in our markets including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2019, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today and Copart has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Jay? Jay Adair : Thank you, Jeff. Well, recently I was discussing with Willis the accomplishments achieved in 2020, and to say it was a unique year would be an understatement on so many fronts. The year started very strong, no No question about that. August was ahead of the prior year both in assignments, in units sold, and in per car yield. The great people that make Copart perform across the organization worked executing both internationally and domestically in existing operations from picking up vehicles, imaging those vehicles, doing -- receiving inventory, processing title, and eventually auctioning and selling off those vehicles. But also we were executing on future opportunities like finding land for capacity, making technological improvements to our internal platforms and our website, creating pipeline supply both through our marketing efforts and our sales team, and really the list of accomplishments goes on and on. We had no reason to see 2020 as anything other than being our best year yet where Copart would achieve record financial performance in an over 26-year history of filing Ks as a public company. By mid-year, we didn't believe that was going to be the case. The world was changing by the hour and the government was actually contemplating and eventually would implement a policy of shutting down nonessential businesses and restricting how frequently and where people drive. This was not just in the U.S. but we were seeing this globally in markets where Copart does business. Today, we have the benefit of hindsight, and despite all the challenges of 2020, it was a year where we actually did put down record performance both from an operational standpoint, but also record financial performance that outdid every year prior to 2020. And I will tell you in the past, we have had many great years where we questioned whether we could raise the bar again after such performance. As you know from history, we have continued to grow Copart, and we've done that again in 2020 even in the face of such an unprecedented and challenging environment. So how do we do this, you might ask. Well, it's a cultural thing, and culture starts with people. We at Copart have the best people in the industry. We talk about people, process, and technology. And while technology and process have driven our business for over two decades, it is the people that not only due to day-to-day execution, but also that can pivot and, if necessary, course correct on a dime when things get challenging, and that's exactly what happened in fiscal 2020. We didn't let the pandemic control us or change our long-term goals, but we did course correct in the short term to address head on the safety of our customers and our employees. Throughout this period, we never dropped the ball on executing inside the organization for our members, our sellers, and our fellow employees. While August, the first month of fiscal 2020 was a record month, April was not. April was off 37% in assignments and 16% in units sold. In terms of assignment volume, it was the worst month of the fiscal year with people not just social distancing, but staying home from school and work, failing to eat out at restaurants, seeing their hair salon and movie theaters closed and the list goes on. Our immediate response was to communicate to all of our employees to stay focused on the job at hand, and that's exactly what our people did. And while they committed to our customers, we committed to them promising no furloughs and no reduced hours. We wanted them to know that while they had our customers back, we had their back. We could have reacted to the environment we faced two ways, positively or negatively. The fact is, we chose the prior, not the latter and viewed this lull in volume as an opportunity, an opportunity to straighten up yards and office space, work old inventory, get zoning approved on land that might have otherwise not been approved prior to COVID and implement efficiencies in our process, all while utilizing new technologies developed during the year. In 2020, we spent over $500 million in CapEx and added over 2,000 acres to our capacity. And I might add, the team never slowed down, during the worst of the COVID pandemic. 2020 is a great example of Copart's performance, in challenging times. We did this in 2008 during the financial crisis, and we have now done this again during the COVID-19 pandemic. Life is unpredictable, always has been, always will be, but at Copart we will always take the position of having a long-term view, and that will always include having a conservative balance sheet. We are owners and thus behave like owners. We challenged the norm every day, we get results; and in the process, it all comes down to our people. People who we celebrate with passion and people who act with integrity in every decision and every action that they make. I used to say before 2008 that we were a recession-resistant company. After 2008, I started saying that we were recession-proof. And now, after 2020, I can confidently say we are a pandemic-proof company. When Willis and I ended our call, I reflected on all that we'd achieved in the year, and all that I'm thankful for. And when talking specifically about Copart, it's our people. I couldn't be prouder of the year and all their achievements. I'd now like to introduce our President, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. Before turning to our financial performance for the quarter, which will provide the metrics we do customarily, a handful of observations about of course the COVID-19 crisis specifically. We anticipate many questions about recent trends, for which we'll provide you our most informed perspectives of course. We also want to draw you back, as Jay just did, to the strategic and operational principles that guide our decision-making. And have guided us through the pandemic, including investing in people, technology, and process, as Jay just articulated. We are immensely proud of our people for delivering our essential service to the communities we work in around the world. We elaborated in more detail on our last call about how important it is that we do what we do to enable the roads and our society's infrastructure to function as it does. We've done so while adapting on the fly to keep our employees members and customers safe. History has shown that, we distinguish ourselves in a time of crisis and investing in our people, processes, technology, and land against the backdrop of arguably the biggest economic disruption of our lifetimes. We think, we've done so again. Our aspiration throughout the crisis has been to deliver much, much more than business as usual. We have adapted real-time to our customers', workflow, modifications, their process changes. We've deployed new technology that has enhanced what we do. And what they do as well. I wanted to make a handful of observations about, some of the key industry drivers that we talk about regularly, including miles driven, accident frequency, total loss frequency, and matters like that before talking about the details of the quarter. As we noted on our last call, and in Jay's overview, we'd observed substantial declines in driving activity, in March and April. And therefore, assignments and inventory as well. Since June, we've seen a gradual and steady improvement in activity levels, with the United States generally recovering more quickly than some of our international markets. Miles driven in the U.S. appears to have toughed in April, with data sources showing a substantial recovery since then, but very mixed on the magnitude of the recovery. We track sources many of which I'm sure you do as well, including Google, Apple, INRIX, University of Washington's, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, all of which or most of which show, substantial declines still, in comparison to last year. As another guidepost, we track data published on gasoline consumption, by the United States Government's Energy Information Administration, which shows that at least for recent weeks gasoline consumption downed mid-to-high single digits, year-over-year. We do believe, we've seen evidence of relative increases in driving activity, as a substitute for mass transit and ride sharing, with good evidence that either or both of those channels of transportation have declined over 50% year-over-year, during the course of the pandemic. On accident frequency, the conventional wisdom has been that accident frequency is positively correlated with miles driven, because congestion naturally contributes to accident frequency. During the pandemic we've seen very strong evidence that the opposite has proven true, with our roads less crowded, speeding and distracted driving had both increased substantially, contributing at least in the near-term to increase accident frequency per miles driven. Over the very long haul, over Copart's, near 40-year existence, we have generally seen accident frequency decline, as cars get safer. The overwhelming offsets to that of course has been, total loss frequency. And on total loss frequency itself, we have seen evidence of increasing total loss frequency, during the pandemic, as well. There are some near-term catalysts, including repair shop interruptions, supply chain interruptions for repair parts and the like, but there are also key critical long-term durable drivers of the same including our improving auction returns, which I'll address next. But auction returns repair costs vehicle complexity those same things remain the case, in the quarter as well. Turning to average selling prices, we experienced a 26.4% increase in global average selling prices year-over-year, for the quarter. That is a record change for Copart and occurred despite some natural headwinds in the business. We've talked at length in the past about the importance of cultivating our international buyer base in particular. And in this quarter and really for the past five years and more it has paid dividends to the business and has done so very much during the pandemic as well. Our member recruitment and retention efforts when married with our auction technology, as a reminder, we have been natively and exclusively a digital auction platform since 2003. Together those have contributed and caused substantial ASP outperformance year-over-year. There are no doubts, some near-term technical factors worth commenting on as well, including strong used car prices against a scarce new car environment, given production constraints, there are some supply chain issues regarding automotive parts replacements and forward repair network as well. But nonetheless, despite very substantial currency headwinds on a year-over-year basis, we have experienced average selling prices for Copart vehicles at all-time highs. With that I'll turn to the actual fourth quarter financial results. We're pleased with the results of the quarter. We experienced a global revenue decline of 3% or just shy of $17 million year-over-year, including an unfavorable year-over-year currency effect of $2.2 million from foreign operations, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar but also partially due to a shift of a customer from a purchase arrangement to a consignment engagement instead. Our global service revenue, which we have generally informed you is a better barometer for business activity declined 2.7% year-over-year with the U.S. down 2.5% and our international business down 4.5%. We experienced purchase vehicle decline in revenue of $4.2 million or just shy of 6% year-over-year, as growth in the U.S. was more than offset by decline internationally including that customer shift to a fee-based sales arrangement in the United Kingdom. Our global unit sales decreased by 18% year-over-year with U.S. unit decreases of 16.3% for the quarter and international declines of 27.1%. I'll elaborate on that separation momentarily. Our U.S. unit decline was of course driven primarily by COVID-19 and its impact on miles driven and therefore consignment volume to Copart. Our non-insurance volume declined 16%, though there is a significant divergence of the underlying sources of automobiles within that segment, I'll comment on momentarily as well. Our international markets encountered in some cases more aggressive responses to COVID-19, affecting driving activity but also title processing and therefore units sold. Within our non-insurance business, our charities and wholesalers business were the most significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding those two portions, our non-insurance volume actually grew year-over-year. Our dealer platform in particular serving automotive dealers who consigned their non-damaged vehicles through Copart increased year-over-year. We continued to attribute our strong non-insurance and dealer performance to our mature natively digital auction platform. We've seen persuasive evidence that otherwise a dealer consigned wholesale auction volumes have declined industry-wide but we experienced year-over-year growth as a result of the liquidity and service that we can provide. On global inventory, we decreased 10.8% compared to the same moment July 31, 2019. In the U.S., we experienced inventory decline of 12.3%, international inventory declined 1.1%. You'll note that our international unit sales declined more significantly than U.S. sales but international inventory did not decline as much. That's a reflection in part of some of the title processing issues I mentioned a moment ago, which has challenged our ability to move cars through the pipeline in certain of our international markets. We don't believe this will have any long-standing or long-lasting effects on the business. It's merely a reflection of near-term technical considerations in light of COVID-19. Our gross profit increased 3.2% from $242.6 million to $250.4 million. Our rate change \u2013 our gross margin rate increased from 44.7% to 47.6%. In the U.S., our increase from 48.8% to 50.1% is a reflection of a number of offsetting forces, including increased average selling prices, which we've talked about at length already, but offset by yard efficiencies or relative inefficiencies due to cost absorption of fewer than expected volumes. Our international gross margins increased substantially due in part to the shift of the customer from a purchase arrangement to a consignment agreement instead. Turning to general and administrative expenditures for the quarter. We have always said that G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time. We will continue to leverage G&A over the long haul. But that's taking a perspective across multiple quarters really for G&A and other drivers as well is the best measure of our actual investments in general and administrative costs. On a year-over-year basis, we're down from $39.8 million a year ago to $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 including reductions in travel expenditures and other such changes that would be attributable to COVID-19. Our GAAP operating income increased from $192.8 to $205.7 million for the quarter or an increase of 6.7%. Our net interest expense was up 12.9% year-over-year due in part to our upsized revolver and fees incurred as a result as well as lower interest earned on our cash balances. On our fourth quarter income tax, we incurred expenses of $36.3 million, which reflects the $6.6 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options offset by a $4.7 million impact from discrete income tax items all of which have been reflected in the non-GAAP earnings reconciliation you've seen. GAAP net income decreased from the fourth quarter of 2019 of $153.5 million to $165 million -- pardon me, increased from $153.5 million to $165.5 million or an increase of 7.8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP income increased by 14.7% from $142.5 million to $163.4 million year-over-year. Last few comments on the balance sheet and our cash flow. On July 21, we increased or upsized our revolver from $850 million to $1.050 billion and extended the maturity through July 21, 2023. It's a reflection of our conservative capitalization and strong credit profile that we were able to achieve that extension and upsizing in a financial or in an economic crisis. As of July 31, we had $1.5 billion of liquidity, which we continue to use to invest in our business. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $267 million, an increase of $74 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by a combination of higher earnings as well as working capital. As noted previously, we continued to invest in our business long-term with land as one critical dimension, but certainly not the exclusive one. We invested $112.7 million of CapEx in the fourth quarter alone 90% of which was attributable to capacity expansion alone. We finished the quarter with just shy of $0.5 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet $477.7 million of cash. We remain well equipped then to invest in our business for the long-term. We're pleased with our fourth quarter. And at this point, Casey will open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robert Labick with CJS Securities. Robert Labick : Morning. Congratulations on strong operating performance in a uniquely difficult environment. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Bob. Robert Labick : I wanted to start -- you mentioned obviously used car pricing is opposite at all-time highs according to Manheim, pretty much anywhere you look. So, two questions related to that. I'm just trying to tease out the drivers for your strong ASPs -- your record ASPs. Can you talk a little bit about, is it more from the dealer or drivable cars or more from the insurance cars being bought by dismantlers, which was a bigger component in driving the ASP growth? Jeff Liaw : Just the sheer volume of the cars, Bob would just mathematically make it so that it has to be the insurance volume driving the 26% increases year-over-year. As you know, the non-insurance cars in the aggregate only comprise about a quarter of our units sold. So it is like-for-like insurance vehicles. Robert Labick : Got it. Okay. And those were generally speaking, close to the 26% I guess, it probably would have been a better way to ask it in terms of the overall ASPs were 26%, were insurance close to that as well? Jay Adair : Yes. Correct. Yes. Robert Labick : Okay. Got it. Great. And then generally speaking as used car pricing rises there may be an offsetting impact to total loss frequency, but obviously we're in a different or unique world, and it's a short time period, but has there been any suppression on total losses or is there -- how is that dynamic working out in the current environment? Jeff Liaw : Well, the dynamic is -- it's the relative value of the cars when it comes to that total loss equation Bob that you know well from having tracked us forever. But it is the relative value of the intact car versus the wrecked cars that drives total loss frequency. And while certainly yes, used car prices are high and all else equal, those used car prices being that robust suppresses volumes that would come to Copart increasing salvage returns by as much as we have arguably drive total loss frequency on a net basis up nevertheless, right? So yes, if our salvage returns were going up 25%, while used car prices were flat or down, that would drive still more volume. The point is that at least for the quarter, used car prices were very strong but salvage returns almost certainly were stronger still. Robert Labick : Got it. Okay. Great. And then has there been any change in the supply dynamics because of the higher proceeds you're receiving? Meaning, are you getting different sellers coming into the market that before maybe weren't interested in using Copart, but seeing the record proceeds are starting to either give you more cars or any kind of change in supply? Jeff Liaw : That's been true within the non-insurance space for years Bob that as our cars gravitate more from back in the day 40 years ago, 35 years ago selling metal by the pounds to selling parts 20 years ago to selling intact drivable cars today even within our insurance cars themselves, that liquidity has naturally invited more and more participants to the auction, and that's certainly been true over the past quarter and the past year and the past five years as well. So yes, in short but not disruptively so in the last 90 days. Robert Labick : Got it. Okay, great. Last one for me, I promise. Just curious about -- I know in the past certainly [audio disturbance] cars that went to auction sold but that was mostly when it was all insurance cars, and as you've had more dealer or non-insurance, I know conversion rates are very high. But has there been any change in conversion rates given the scarcity of vehicles during the quarter so that maybe you even benefited from even higher conversion rates than in the not-too-distant past? Jeff Liaw : Not unusually so Bob. I think conversion rates are very robust and we track and manage carefully, but I would -- again wouldn't say there was an unusual disruption in the quarter. Robert Labick : Got it. Okay, super. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird & Company. Craig Kennison : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations. Wanted to follow-up on the non-insurance market. I mean you've got this all digital platform. You've had it for a long time now. That should have been an ideal platform for you during the pandemic when a lot of the physical competitors were closed. I'm curious to what extent Copart was able to capitalize on this opportunity specifically to grow in the used car market? Jeff Liaw : Fair question Craig. I think the math we do isn't any different what you would. So, when you track the other publicly-traded auction houses for whole cars, I think you can see what relative performance would have been. I think we've noted that others have experienced declines in a period and meaningful declines in a period where we actually experienced growth. So, I think that's about all we know directionally, so we don't have any insider perspective in particular on those other companies, but we do believe against a backdrop of generally declining wholesale dealer volume that we have increased year-over-year. Craig Kennison : Am I right that this was a unique opportunity for you to really pitch the service to potential sellers and maybe you\u2019ve got a better look this time than in past pitches? Jeff Liaw : I'd say yes and no. COVID-19 certainly has underscored how powerful Copart's natively digital platform, which has been exclusively digital since 2003. And having lived that way for 17 years means that we have honed that platform and understand it well. And other competitors had to do so at the tip of the spear had to virtualize overnight. And yes, I think Copart is distinct in that regard. So, on the margin, surely, it has enhanced our value proposition. In COVID-19, of course, it's also across any walk of life difficult to meet new people. So, it has reduced what otherwise might be the natural selling cadence as you get to know new parties, dealers, and otherwise, but I think on balance it has been a very positive force for Copart. Craig Kennison : And then circling back on the ASP commentary, I mean it's just an incredible number. To what extent do you think that reverses over time knowing that the pandemic was a factor? I know the long-term trend has been up, but for those of us who have to build a model should we bake in some year-over-year decline as we lap that next year? Jeff Liaw : The short answer Craig is that I don't know. There are -- as I noted in those comments a moment ago certainly some near-term technical factors to consider. The underlying drivers I think are still very long-term favorable. But as for predicting precisely what happens next quarter next year, I think that remains challenging. I would say that there's been some -- as one tidbit here. When we look at the buyers non-U.S. buyers of Copart cars at U.S. auctions we note that the currencies declined very meaningfully year-over-year. So, their purchasing power was meaningfully compromised relative to a year ago. But nonetheless the value of the cars they purchased increased substantially plus or minus in proportion with our overall ASP increase which meant that in their local currency, they're spending still more and dramatically more. So, I think the power of that liquidity is never going away. There is the flywheel effects now of driving more total loss frequency with outstanding returns we get lighter damaged cars which brings more buyers. But we do think that this is a productive period for us in further spinning that flywheel. Exactly what the year-over-year comparison will look like Craig we don't know. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Craig. Operator : We'll take our next question from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Daniel Imbro : Good morning guys. I wanted to start on the G&A side, really impressive control. I think probably one of the biggest surprises in the composition of the quarter to us. You mentioned travel being down. But can you provide any more color on kind of where you did remove costs? You mentioned, I think there wasn't any furlough employee removal. So, how do you think about like the sustainability of the cost cuts? Has anything changed there in your thinking? Jeff Liaw : No. Nothing has changed in our thinking. We did not furlough employees and continued to invest in our people. We continued to hire, to train, to promote, because that's what it takes to build a successful business over the next 20 years hard stop. On G&A, I'll be militantly consistent right in quarters where it's up a couple of million or down a couple of million. I'll ask you to use many quarters to draw your trend lines. No individual quarter is the right predictive model for future trends. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up on Craig's dealer question. You clearly gained share in the quarter. When you talk to the dealers on your platform, are you seeing them stay on Copart as some of the competitors reopen? And if they are, does that change you guys' long-term strategy around how much of your business could be dealer or should be dealer? I think in the past you've mentioned, you don't want that to be a majority of your business. But, yes, how has the success in that during the pandemic maybe impacted those long-term thoughts? Jeff Liaw : We've grown that dealer business in very steadily and very consistently for years. So, I don't -- we don't perceive this as a temporary one-time pickup. We invest in that business, because it is an excellent and profitable business for us and we invested it, because it's an excellent and profitable addition to our auction liquidity, which ultimately benefits our insurance customers as well as we draw evermore buyers to our platform we also will drive salvage returns upwards. So, I would say even before COVID-19, the whole car auction business is as competitive as it has ever been with very strong incumbents, with strong venture-backed new entrants into the business as well. And even against that backdrop, we continue to grow our volume virtually every quarter for, as many years as I've been here certainly, and we don't expect. We believe that competitive advantage is that is the auction liquidity point. And if anything our liquidity will improve as a result of COVID-19. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. And then last one for me, touching on the balance sheet. As we think about uses for cash, I wanted to hear your thoughts on capacity. I mean to handle more volume and continued growth we kind of have two choices. You add capacity or you improve your throughput pretty hard. Is there a meaningful opportunity to really improve throughput from here? Or as we think about long-term CapEx, is that going to have to -- should that continue to grow to support future volume growth? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Daniel. We will do both and have to do both. So we focus very much on improving cycle times and turning cars more quickly, both because it is capital-efficient for us, but also because it is a better outcome for our customers, who can settle claims and close files more quickly who can achieve better auction returns with less depreciation with the cars sitting on our properties. So, that is an evergreen initiative on the part of Copart and has been forever. So yes, we will invest in reducing cycle times and can improve. But also, yes, we will continue to invest in our land and capacity, because it is absolutely necessary to serve our customers well, both in the ordinary course and in catastrophic times. We have to be prepared to absorb volatility. So, we are happily investing and have invested through the pandemic in additional capacity and expect to do so for years to come. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thanks so much guys, and best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hi. Good morning, guys. Jeff Liaw : Good morning. Bret Jordan : I got cut off for a second. So hopefully, I'm not going to ask this question twice. But, I guess, if you think about pricing and its role in the quarter, could you talk year-over-year about maybe what you've seen from a pricing increase? And as you look at the whole cars, as you get into the dealer space and you're competing with some legacy players, is there any bias to move prices lower as people will compete for share in that space? Jeff Liaw : I want to make sure I understand precisely your question Bret. You mean the prices we achieved at auction for the vehicles or the prices -- the fee... Bret Jordan : The fee -- the buyers -- yeah, the rate on buyer fees year-over-year in the insurance space, and then whether or not there's any bias to be increasingly competitive on the fees charged as you get into the dealer cars? Jeff Liaw : On fees, we don't comment, Bret. Publicly available of course on our website is a fee schedule that our members incur when they purchase cars at Copart and for other services that we provide. Bret Jordan : Okay. Anything that you're seeing as far as dealer volumes and pricing? Jeff Liaw : Dealer volume noted -- you may have clicked off the call at that moment, but we have experienced increases year-over-year in dealer volumes for the quarter, and that's against what we believe our competitors who have experienced very meaningful declines in dealer consigned volumes for the quarter. So, we believe that we have grown our dealer business relatively speaking much faster than the rest of the industry. That is not a reflection of, of course, aggressive fees on our part. We believe that we have a very competitive offering, and ultimately deliver the best possible returns to our dealers. But that's easy to say. But, we think the very consistent growth in our Copart dealer services volume is a reflection of the actual reality in practice. Bret Jordan : Okay. And I guess did you comment on capacity utilization? I think you said, you've added over 2000 acres. Did you talk about what your average utilization is? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. Average utilization I think not super meaningful, because the land isn't fungible and each yard is its own -- certainly each metropolitan area is its own island. And even though Dallas and Texas are in -- Dallas and Houston are in the same state, you can't really use one city's facilities as fungible capacity for the other. So, we certainly monitor our metropolitan areas very carefully and invest accordingly based on our baseline expectations over the next five or 10 years. Certainly capacity utilization is lower during the pandemic than it otherwise would be, for all the reasons you already know about, inventory and driving activity and so forth. But capacity utilization is a microeconomic evaluation, which then drives our investment decisions on a micro basis. But in the aggregate, we will continue to invest in land for years to come. Bret Jordan : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. I think it's really incredible the increase in average selling prices that you reported. Can you just help us think about the ways that that helps Copart? Is it the case that you generally charge buyers a fixed percentage of the transaction price in agency model transactions anyway such that the revenue from higher prices falls just pretty well through to profit? And then also it'd be great if you could comment on the reasons for such a large increase in prices and the sustainability of the various factors driving prices higher? Jeff Liaw : Got it. On your former question Ryan that member fee schedule is readily available online. So we encourage you to look there and you can see what happens to the fees that our buyers incur based on changes in the selling prices of vehicles. As for the pricing changes and the actual pricing at our auction or the selling prices for cars that are auctioned they are high for a combination of technical, but also fundamental reasons. The technical reasons you heard us comment on are the used car prices are robust against the supply-constrained new car environment. But the fundamental reasons are rising total loss frequency new or less damaged cars being totaled better auction liquidity we have driven more bids per vehicle by far than we did a year ago in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. So those are the fundamental drivers which we think ultimately are the most important ones. There will be near-term technical changes certainly some of which we are benefiting from today, but others of which are unfavorable including volumes for example. But over the long-haul, the flywheel of auction liquidity the recruitment of international -- recruitment and retention and cultivation of international buyers we think will continue to drive selling prices upwards, total loss frequency upwards which in turn of course is self reinforcing, self reinforcing bringing ASPs up as well. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. And then just finally are you able to comment on the trend in assignments here in 1Q? Do you have a timeframe in mind for when miles driven or assignments will return to pre-pandemic levels? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Appreciate the question. That remains I think largely unknowable. We have generally seen a continuation of the trends that we were marked on in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but we'll talk much more about the first quarter of course including storms and so forth on our first quarter call. But we've generally seen a continuation as for when society returns to normal practices we'll leave that to the experts. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey good morning everyone. Just looking at the change in the purchase margin -- gross margin sequentially and year-over-year you mentioned it was being -- some of that was driven by a move from a purchase to a consignment agreement. Are we to assume that that move in and of itself, was that agreement that you had on a purchase pretty detrimental to the margins overall? And that getting that out of the mix just led to those vehicle sales margins going up pretty dramatically? And is that gross margin sustainable? Jeff Liaw : The answer to your first question is, no. It's not that the purchase vehicles of that particular customer were very, very unprofitable somehow and we removed them. We don't much these days Gary about -- we prefer consignment arrangements because we think it generally is a better alignment of interest between us and our customers, but it's not per se a profitability decision. The purchased vehicle changes year-over-year the decline in revenue is in part attributable to this shift in that customer because now instead of showing up as purchased vehicle sales and purchased vehicle COGS, it now shows up instead as service fees. But otherwise no that was not any meaningful driver for the change in purchased vehicle profitability. Gary Prestopino : Well was it ASPs? And... Jeff Liaw : Yes. In short, yes. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then could you give us some idea. I know you said your dealer business was up, but could you put a number on that in terms of the growth in units year-over-year? Jeff Liaw : It's up meaningfully. I think we've historically said -- disclosed we've been up double digits. In this case it wasn't double digits but meaningfully so. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then just getting back to my other question, I'm sorry about the sustainability of that gross margin. Is that something that again that's going to really be driven by what the ASPs do in the future? Jeff Liaw : Yes. And I forgot that third or that quarter of your prior question. We don't manage the business to gross margin rate per se Gary, we're of course optimizing for service and returns and profitability and so forth. So the margin rate is really just a byproduct metric that we track at the end of the month and the quarter as a matter of visibility but it's not -- we think about the business on a per car basis and how much profit and contribution we generate per unit. So the rate is not something we consider, but your point about ASPs very strong average selling price performance contributing to our profitability, yes that's certainly true. To the point about consignments, we want to work with our customers on that basis to drive the highest possible returns which yield the very best outcomes for them and for us. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then last question just on your dealer business. I would assume that most of your dealer customers are independent. So is that correct? Jeff Liaw : Yes. Gary Prestopino : So, is the assignment from the independent dealers of a car, is that driving a lot of the growth? Or are you finding a lot of the independents are also buying cars from you? Jeff Liaw : Don't follow -- didn't follow the question. Meaning, yes, we are growing go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Yes, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is that, if an independent takes in a trade that they don't want to keep on their lot. Are they handing it off to you to sell? Or are you seeing more of the usage of the platform, the independent dealer buying cars to replenish inventory? Jeff Liaw : Well, they certainly participate on both sides. So, yes, we are growing the consignment volume. And yes, we are also a viable purchase channel for dealers as well. Gary Prestopino : Okay. But you have very few franchise dealers that are using your platform right now. Jeff Liaw : We have a good variety of non-insurance consignment sources including dealers of all types. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph Hafling with Truist Securities. Joseph Hafling : This is Joe on for Stephanie. How are you guys doing? Jeff Liaw : Good. How are you Joe? Joseph Hafling : I just had a couple of quick questions maybe quickly shifting back to the non-insurance business. I was wondering if everything which is going on with rental, if you guys could talk about maybe how that was going, if you had any opportunities on the rental side of non-insurance? Jeff Liaw : In short, that's a relevant target segment for us. We have served that segment of the market for some time. Plenty of disruptions as you know Joe in that corner of the universe given what's happened to travel trends over time. So, for all the same reasons that we are increasingly a compelling offering to the dealer universe, we think that's also true for the rentals and financial institutions and otherwise. Joseph Hafling : Okay. Great. And then maybe just another one from me. I was wondering, if you can give an update on Germany, particularly with maybe some of the problems with some pandemic maybe causing that to accelerate the insurance company there? Jeff Liaw : Yes. We remain very excited about our long-term prospects in Germany and continue to invest in our business there, including all the dimensions we've talked about before which is in people and technology, and land capacity, in trucks and equipments and certainly in customer relationship building as well. I think we noted a couple of calls ago that we are selling cars for insurance carriers on a consignment basis. We're delivering some very strong returns and remain very optimistic about Germany and frankly about Western Europe in general. Joseph Hafling : Okay. But -- you haven't seen anything as far as like the productivity of this conversation increasing because of the disruptions the pandemic caused over there? Jeff Liaw : I think, it's too early to tell. I think, there's some -- your intuition is probably reasonable in that if there is a -- I think we have demonstrated that the Copart Germany model is economically superior and frankly even experientially superior for policyholders than the status quo. We talked about that at length in the past, so I won't rehash that entire narrative. But one of the big barriers to out converting the market is just inertia. And so yes to the extent that COVID-19 has forced us all to confront inertia and has up ended a lot of what we consider the ordinary course. I think in that respect yes, this can cause customers to contemplate radical changes in their business. Joseph Hafling : Okay. Great. Thank you. That was everything I had. Congrats on the quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now turn it back to today's speakers for closing remarks. Jay Adair : All right. We appreciate everyone showing up for the call and we look forward to reporting Q1 in the future. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Jeff Liaw : Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Thanks and good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency-related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises and the effect on common equivalent shares from ASU 2016-09. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website under the Investor Relations link and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. We analyze our results on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets, including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31st, 2020 and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today and Copart has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. And with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Jay. Jay Adair : Thanks, John. Appreciate it. While fiscal 2020 was a record year despite the pandemic, and as we talked about in the last quarter, our people performed across the organization through what was really a year of not just challenges, but a year of unknowns, and we met daily, we course corrected daily, and I'm happy and proud to say that we had an amazing - not only record year in terms of results, but in terms of accomplishments. And Q1 of this year is starting strong and I believe it's indicative of the year ahead. I was talking to Jeff this morning, 26 years ago, Willis and I went to New York and Copart became a public Company. And as I stepped on the streets of New York and saw it for the first time, I was amazed and when we eventually went public and I saw the inner workings of Wall Street, I was amazed and I was confused. And today, 26 years later, I can't say I understand Wall Street any better. I think that's probably a good thing. What I do know is a great Company when I see it, and Copart is a great Company. Jeff and John are going to give you guys details today on the quarter, but at the highest level, when we look at Q1 we saw record results, we saw record sale prices and we saw record returns for our customers. And that bodes well for our future. Copart has continued to grow over the years. We've done that till process have being prepared, we've done that through excellent technology, the best systems, the best technology in the industry and the best people delivering the best service in the industry. And I see no reason why that's going to change. Just three years ago, the entire EBITDA for Copart for the year was nearly $538 million, and then this quarter, we generated over $275 million of EBITDA. And we knew this was going to happen, we started a campaign, 3.5, four years ago called 20/20/20 where we went out and aggressively started adding land to our existing locations and opening additional new locations and then in addition to that, we went out and opened up mega sites for catastrophes all along the Eastern seaboard and all the way over to across the Gulf and into Houston. And so we've continued to be prepared, we've continued to spend big on land and we did that again not only in 2020, but in the first quarter of this year. We now have a record number of acres available to us to store cars, and that means that we have the capacity for not just the market as it grows and we'll continue to do so with technology and cars, but as we continue to win new business. I view our continued investment in land as a continued investment in our future. And looking forward, we still have a large list of acquisitions that we would like to make. We won't be able to make them all, we won't be able to get the zoning, we won't be able to get the deal done on the land. And as many of you know on the call, some of these acquisitions can take three, four, five years to come to fruition. But we have a big pipeline, and we'll continue to work on that as we continue to believe in our growth. I'm happy to say that volume assigned is starting to return to pre-COVID levels. I actually had a little bit of traffic on the way to work this morning and we haven't really seen that in six months. So volume is almost back to where it was prior to COVID, not quite there yet, we still don't have everybody driving as frequently as they were before COVID. But clearly, we are starting to see a lot more miles driven across the country. Sales still lag, volume and this is obvious, but back when COVID started., we were selling off inventory even though we weren't getting big assignment volume, now we're getting large assignment volume and not selling off the inventory yet. So in the next quarter or two, I suspect we'll be selling those vehicles off and could be more or less back to normal in terms of assignment volume and sales volume in about six months. I'm excited about some of the new changes we've made in our senior management team. You heard John this morning, John has a two-decade plus experience in the Automotive industry, working in automotive companies. And so, I'm very excited to have him on our team. I know he's excited about our future and to be part of Copart and we're excited to have him in our leadership team as CFO of Copart. I've said this before, our people and our systems have never been stronger. And as you know, we don't think about Copart in a quarter or in the next year, we think about it in the next five to ten years. And I'm excited about the team that we have upgraded and built in the last six months. Our CFO, our Chief Marketing Officer, our COO and Jeff leading the team, I feel very good about our executive leadership team and our future for the next 10-year horizon. So now for more details on the quarter, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff, our President. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Jay. It's been just two short months since our last earnings call, but it sometimes feels like multiple years' worth of world events have transpired since then. First, like as Jay did, I wanted to express how proud I am of the Copart team. It's been immensely gratifying as an organization to be able to do our part to provide an essential service to the communities we work in around the world. We've taken very seriously the importance of adapting our procedures to keep our employees, members and customers safe at the same time. The disruption and adaptation have been substantial and continuous and we're profoundly grateful for the commitment of our people to a job well done. Our aspiration throughout the crisis has been to deliver much more than business stabilization or business as usual. We've been committed to playing offense to improving the way we do business and to investing in our long-term future and we've done so. We deployed new products and features for both internal and customer facing applications. We've enhanced ProQuote, our best-in-class machine learning powered price estimation tool for our insurance carrier partners. We've grown our first to market digital loan payoff product. We've deployed electronic signature processes and we've updated our communications technology among many other achievements over the course of the pandemic. Under Willis J and many other senior Copart leaders who predate John and me, we had the foresight to build our businesses a natively digital one. We've been operating exclusively online auctions since 2003 and have therefore adapted our workflow smoothly to the pandemic. I wanted to draw out a few industry themes we've observed over the past quarter, really the past two quarters, many a continuation of the themes we talked about on the last call. We continue to observe lower than baseline driving activity, but with a steady increase from the pandemic trough with the U.S. generally recovering more quickly than some of our international markets. The data on miles driven is noisy depending on the source. We track many of the sources you do, Google, Apple and Rick's among others. Most of that data indicates they're still relative to pre-pandemic baselines, we are seeing much less commuting traffic and retail and recreation-related driving. Nonetheless, a meaningful sequential improvement from the - from the COVID-19 trough. As another guidepost, we note that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has recently published data indicating that gas consumption is down, plus or minus 10% versus a year ago. We have also seen relative increases in driving activity relative to other forms of transportation including mass transit and ride sharing where we've seen activity down some 50%. As for the other important drivers of our business, accident frequency, conventional wisdom has held that accident frequency is positively correlated with miles driven because congestion contributes to accident frequency. During the pandemic, we continue to see evidence that in some scenarios anyway, the opposite is true. One industry source has indicated substantial double-digit increases in speeding, phone usage and hard braking. With our roads less crowded, speeding and distracted driving have both increased contributing to increased accident frequency per miles driven. And then of course on total loss frequency and accident severity, which we have emphasized as the most important long-term driver of our business. The long-term trend of rising total loss frequency has very much continued during the pandemic. There are some indications that it may have accelerated during the pandemic, in part due to the high returns we are generating at auction. Turning to our unit sales trends, we experienced a global unit sales decrease of 13% for the quarter, with the U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an international unit decline of 11%. The unit decline of course has been driven by the COVID-19 impact on miles driven and therefore the absolute number of accidents and total vehicles. Our non-insurance business, within that non-insurance business, charities and wholesalers have been the most significantly affected by COVID-19. Excluding those two categories, our non-insurance volume has grown year-over-year, including those two categories, we were down a 11%. Within that non-insurance group, our dealer business in particular was up 11% in units sold year-over-year compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms for dealers, a continuing validation of our business model. Our global inventory decreased 3.6% versus a year ago, that is comprised of a U.S. inventory decline of 3.3% year-over-year and an international inventory decline of 5.3%. Turning then to selling prices for vehicle at our auctions, despite some natural headwinds and the economic disruption of the pandemic crisis, we've experienced ASPs for our vehicles at all time highs, a reflection both of market dynamics as well as our own member recruitment and retention efforts. ASPs worldwide grew 37.3% year-over-year for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 39%. Used car prices have no doubt helped to contribute to that high ASP environment for us. They are however only up 15% or thereabouts year-over-year based on some of the industry indices we track. With our selling prices meaningfully exceeding the used car price environment, we believe that's a reflection in part of our marketing efforts and member recruitment. Turning in to the last theme, we've closed out an unusually busy hurricane season and we are very proud of our CAT teams. As always, we stand ready to respond to catastrophic events with land, equipment and people that are second to none in the industry. This year was in some respect the most active Atlantic storm season on record with 30 named storms and 13 hurricanes. The property damage effect however was less severe than we've experienced in prior seasons, but we're nonetheless grateful for the Copart CAT team and their multiple mobilizations in support of our customers and communities this season. Before I hand it off to John to walk through our financial highlights, it certainly feels like one of the most tumultuous windows in my own career with no doubt, still more uncertainty and change ahead. Our experience so far in 2020 has given us great conviction that we're ready for anything. Just a few days short of Thanksgiving, we're grateful for our people, grateful for our customers who empower us to continue investing in their long-term prosperity and our own. And with that, I'll turn it over to our new CFO, John North to walk through the first quarter financial results. John North : Great. Thanks, Jeff. First, I just want to say thanks to Jay for the warm welcome, and to just reiterate how happy I am to be at Copart. It's obviously a phenomenal organization and team and I am sure proud to be here. With that said, I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide more color around the earlier remarks and then we'll open it up for some questions. Global revenue increased $38.5 million or 6.9%, including a $2.5 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $27.5 million or 5.6%, a more accurate reflection of the underlying activity in our business and primarily due to higher ASPs. U.S. business grew 4.5% and international experienced an increase of 14.2%. Purchased vehicle sales increased $11 million or 16.5% as growth in the U.S. was partially offset by international declines, primarily driven by COVID-19 volume impact and a U.K. customer shift to a fee-based sales contract. Purchased vehicle profits defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales increased by $5.4 million as modest volume declines were more than offset by higher ASPs. Gross profit increased by $41.9 million or 16.4% and our gross margin rate improved by approximately 400 basis points to 50.1%. U.S. margin improved from 49.2% to 52.6% predominantly due to increased ASPs, partially offset by negative yard operating leverage due to reduced cost absorption across pure vehicle sold. International margins increased from 29.5% to 37% driven primarily by rising ASPs, but similar to the U.S. was affected by higher cost per unit processed. I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. In general, G&A expenditures will fluctuate and grow over time, but we continue to believe we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long term as if all trended data sold in our business, gross margins, G&A, unit sales and inventory changes. And we encourage you to review longer-dated headlines rather than a single quarter metric for more - a more accurate view of the business, particularly given the recent COVID impact. With that said, our G&A costs were down slightly, a decrease of $0.8 million from $43.3 million a year ago to $42.5 million in 2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 21% from $205.4 million to $248.6 million. We delivered approximately 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs, partially offset by negative operating leverage from a lower absolute volume of vehicles. Net interest expense increased $1 million or 25% year-over-year due to reduced interest income on collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increase in debt issuance costs and unused line of credit fees due to the July 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment. Q1 income tax expense was $46.5 million at an 18.9% effective tax rate reflecting an $11.8 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included on the earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 23.7%. In summary, GAAP net income decreased 8.2% from $218.2 million last year to $200.3 million this year due to a prior-year tax rate reduction for stock option exercises. Adjusted to remove these items, non-GAAP net income increased 21.2% from $155.4 million last year to $188.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights, as of October 31st, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity, comprised of $605.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $424.6 million over October 31st, 2019 and a $1.05 billion capacity on our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased $46.1 million year-over-year to $258.5 million, primarily driven by working capital benefits. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $8.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 as assignments have ramped back up consuming working capital and due to income tax effects. We invested $147.1 million in capital expenditures in the quarter and over 90% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion and lease buyouts. In conclusion, our conservative capitalization and strong cash flow enable us to continue to make decisions for the long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. That concludes our remarks, we're happy to take some questions. Diego? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please state your question. Bob Labick : So obviously another terrific quarter and it looks like maybe both ASPs and volumes were up sequentially from the July quarter, but ASPs rose faster. And I say this because service revenue grew faster than yard costs. And so, I'm trying to understand the dynamic here between ASPs and supply and demand and see what other factors may be at play. And - so do you think there's been an increase in demand from the pandemic as you brought in new people, new buyers, etc, so that demand could even continue to outstrip supply even when volumes do return to pre-pandemic levels or how do you see kind of ASPs faring as volumes recover, I guess is the question. Jeff Liaw : Yes, it's a very fair - and in certain complex answer - complex question and answer. I think in short, the prices are high, and it is assuredly not just the supply and demand. And I say that with some conviction Bob, because if volumes were down 13%, but ASPs are up 37%, then there are literally many, many, many more actual dollars purchasing cars at Copart, right, so on fewer units we're seeing more absolute dollars. So I think that leads me to conclude that at least in part, we are continuing to grow the demand base for the vehicles. You may recall we had grown, expanded our marketing efforts, we hired a new SVP of Marketing, we opened new lounges. So that's been an ongoing multiple decades theme, frankly, Bob. But that's certainly borne fruit in the pandemic, and we will continue to invest in that going forward. So how much of today's ASP increase is a function of supply and demand is hard to say. I'm sure it's part of it, but it's certainly not all of it. I think, equally important perhaps is the growth of the buyer base, and also frankly the total loss frequency. Those are interrelated as well and as total loss frequency increases and more and more marginal totals are totaled, those of course further drive ASPs upward, they further recruit new buyers because those cars are closer to immediately drivable. So there certainly is a favorable, a virtuous flywheel effect which we think is we're seeing in the pandemic as well. Bob Labick : And then a question on international, didn't talk too much about it yet, so how has COVID impacted your plans? I think in the past you talked about Germany now starting to sell on an agency basis, so maybe an update on Germany, where it's going. Then the overall international emerging opportunities and were they affected by COVID, and how do you see those over the next three years to five years? Jeff Liaw : So I think the short answer to your question is that the countries have very much been affected by COVID-19. I think I made a brief comment in passing, there are the two varying degrees, and in general, more severely than in the U.S. Our plans and our intentions and our execution, I don't think had varied as a result of pandemic. So investing in Germany, which you called out specifically continues to be a key theme for us. We continue to invest in the land and the technology and the people. And we are selling cars as you noted on an agency basis for carriers in Germany today, and so far demonstrating excellent results in doing so. The growth path then remains the same with all of the opportunities and challenges you've heard us talk about on prior calls, but including changing the way the industry manages the total - the total loss process in general to the benefit of both insurance carriers and the policyholders. So that of course is a much longer discussion, but no, our perspective on it certainly hasn't changed. Bob Labick : And last one from me. Just a congratulations to John and the other new hires. So Jeff for you - and maybe Jay, but how do your roles change now with the new hires and the kind of expanded executive team? Jeff Liaw : I think the - I'd say, the senior leadership approach at Copart has always been quite fluid, right. So I think the walls at Copart between functions and countries are quite a bit lower than what you would generally observe in public companies of our size and stature. So I think it's fluid, but certainly John will take on much more of the day to day leadership of what are traditionally considered finance and accounting functions including accounting, including Investor Relations and so forth. But also help to - help us navigate the strategic future for Copart in evaluating return on investments and our approach to evaluating ROIC for the various initiatives we undertake. Our new SVP of Marketing, Scott Booker comes from the online travel industry, which I'm sure you well know is one of the more challenging, competitive and difficult arenas when it comes to the online marketplace universe. And so, he will spearhead our efforts in continuing to grow that buyer base and continuing to build the demand for the supply that we bring to market. So I think day to day, it's hard to answer because no individual day looks like the other, but I think they will certainly take very meaningful leadership roles in their specific functions. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist Securities. Please state your question. Stephanie Benjamin : I wanted to touch a bit on the non-insurance side of your business. It saw a pretty, pretty strong growth particularly in the dealer side as well as excluding some of that charity wholesale business you called out, Jeff. You know, really interesting I think it made sense, just given your digital platform for the strong outperformance we saw in last quarter. But clearly that continued into this quarter, despite some of the other traditional non-insurance auction providers opening up more. So maybe you can speak a little bit about what you're seeing in that segment. If there have been some share gains or some opportunity where it's actually sticky, pretty sticky, and these gains kind of continue going forward. And really wasn't just pandemic driven. Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think it's a fair question, Stephanie. I think if you go back and you've been following us for years now, but track the individual quarter-by-quarter trends for Copart Dealer Services, I think you could see this growth trajectory long predated the pandemic by many years. So it's a business we've steadily grown over the years and we've grown it today in the pandemic, while other wholesale auction platforms we think have not grown nearly to the same extent, in many cases may have shrunk. That's largely a product of auction returns, what the - what we generate for our sellers at auction is ultimately what matters. I'm sure we are - I'd like to think we're very likable people and charming, but ultimately the dealer's key priority is achieving an excellent return and doing so quickly. And the liquidity of our online marketplace I think is what's distinguished us. We haven't had to adapt real time, we haven't had to invent a purely digital auction after having become accustomed to physical auctions instead. So I think there is something about being natively digital which perhaps has helped to enhance our relative performance during the pandemic. But more broadly, that is an important - important profit driver for us, important long-term revenue growth driver for us as well. And we are achieving good returns for our dealers and aspire to do more and better still. Stephanie Benjamin : And I was wondering you'd touch a little bit on the international side of your business. I know you spoke a little bit on Germany and some of the efforts there. Has there been any kind of internal plans or investments to expand even further internationally, so maybe in some other new markets? Jeff Liaw : In short, yes. I think Germany and in Spain where we have a footprint as well have always been viewed as the gateway to Western Europe more broadly. Western Europe shares many of the characteristics, many of the macroeconomic and social characteristics that make total loss such a compelling economic proposition in the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and elsewhere and that is a high repair costs, high regulatory burdens and so forth in good cars that have intrinsic value both in those native markets and elsewhere in emerging markets where demand for cars and repairable drivable cars and mobility continues to expand over time as well. So Western Europe certainly is a - it's our expectation that our success in Germany and Spain will eventually extend elsewhere there. Now there are other international markets long term that certainly will emerge as priorities for us as well, but I'd say for the relevant X-year horizon, our emphasis is on our core markets where we already do business today, Germany and Spain and Western Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please state your question. Craig Kennison : Wanted to start with government lock down scenarios, I know the government in various geographies are considering different lock down options here, and I'm just wondering if you see geographies that are more at risk or if you're approaching the spike in cases we've seen across the globe in a different manner, now that you've learned what you have through early - the early portion of the pandemic. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Craig. A good question, and one I'm not sure we have a more enlightened perspective than you do. So it's a function of both of the virus trends themselves and then the expected government and social response to them. And I think we've now have six months of experience, all of us do in understanding how - or eight months, understanding how that unfolds. So we are prepared for really any scenario, including very extreme lock downs, I'd argue that the April, May, June timeframe was among the more severe windows and we could adapt, we're able to adapt our operations, able to prove that our operations are an essential service to the communities we do business in. So I expect to continue to be able to serve our customers and our communities. The volume effects, I think remains to be seen. I think it's fair to say we don't know. Craig Kennison : And my second question has more to do just big picture with your relationships with your insurance consignors. We know that you have some exclusive relationships where your insurance partner consigns 100% of their volume to Copart. You have others where you get a fraction of that volume. I guess I can see how an insurer might want to have more than one vendor for that service, but what would be the benefits for an insurer that commits to an exclusive agreement with Copart? Is it cost, are there - is there data that is unique when you have an exclusive relationship? Is there a priority access? I'm just curious why you're able to win those exclusive deals. Jeff Liaw : I think the exclusive deals are a reflection of a strong relationship with those customers. It's not per se that we have American Airlines' platinum status with warm nuts at the front of the plane, per se. It's more just a reflection of the excellent returns we generate, the excellent service we provide to them. So a, there is no secret ring per se, Craig. But we work like hell to earn that trust from our customers. We earn it in the day to day in the pickup and towing of vehicles and the auction management returns we generate and the entire work we do for them. And certainly we work like hell on catastrophic events to make sure that we are the most responsive, that we have the most people and process and technology on the ground to serve them at those critical moments. So those exclusive agreements are a badge of honor for us that we work like hell to earn, and for the carriers, the benefit to them is that they get the Copart experience end to end. It certainly does reduce the complexity for them in not having to manage as many providers across their own platforms, and so there is one counterparty with whom to integrate technologically, there's one counterparty with whom to discuss inventory trends in X, Y, Z markets or processing older dated units and so forth. So the simplicity I think is worthwhile for makers as well. But in general, I think it's a reflection of a - of good service and good returns. Craig Kennison : Great, thanks. And Jay, if you figure out Wall Street, please let me know. Jay Adair : Yes. I love it when you knock the cover off the ball and the market moves the opposite direction, you think it's going to move. So it's something I'm yet to figure out. I'll let you know. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please state your question. Bret Jordan : On the dealer volumes, that growth against the declining backdrop, I guess, is there an explanation and are there more cars that you're selling in the non-insurance that are going to export? Are you getting a higher bid in North Africa or Eastern Europe and that's driving incremental units to you? And I guess when you think about across the board units, do you have a feeling for the direction of how many cars go to export now, are you exporting more of your volumes than you were maybe a year ago? Jeff Liaw : So the answer to your - the first part of your question is yes, a meaningful portion of those cars we auction on behalf of our dealers are ultimately exported and it's therefore that more expansive buyer universe with access to the cars that helped to drive the differential returns. The more precise question you asked afterwards about whether the international buyer mix is higher year-over-year, over that time horizon, it's harder to say. And I think it's probably flat, it may even be down slightly in part because of the currencies of the relevant buyer countries for us had been weakened in the pandemic. Currencies, if you've been tracking throughout, there's been a lot of noise, some currency depreciated a lot versus the dollar and others have depreciated a lot. For the buying countries, their currencies have generally weakened. So they are actually paying way, way more in their own local currencies, and our international demand in absolute terms then has grown. But their relative purchasing advantage is more in near term impaired. So over the kind of time horizon you're describing, it's closer to breakeven in terms of the volume changes year-over-year, but certainly over a 10-year and 20-year horizon, the international buyer is much more important today than it was ten years ago and will be much more important in ten years than they are today. Bret Jordan : And then a question on catastrophic, you talked about multiple mobilizations, but limited property damage. Was catastrophic a negative in the quarter in the sense that you had the cost of showing up to storms, but not enough volume created by them? Jeff Liaw : It is, but not enough to call out and in part because I think we've seen enough seasons to know that it's always - there's always going to be some noise in it and trying to adjust for - I don't see a whole lot of value in trying to report no storm EBITDA, right, because I'm not sure there are no storm operating profit, I'm not sure there's any scenario in which there are no storms whatsoever. So suffice it to say that when there are various severe events like Hurricane Harvey, they call it a meaningful net effect in our P&L, you'll hear us describe it, but we generally try to accept as good and bad the noise that comes in the business and this year's storm activity I would characterize as such. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Ryan Brinkman : Congrats on another strong quarter. Thanks for taking my question, which is about - you know, the second straight quarter of this 26% or 27% year-over-year growth in average selling prices. Firstly, are these record price increases? I cannot recall them previously growing this fast. And then also, can you just talk about the biggest factors that are driving the increase and maybe rate the sustainability, your outlook for those different factors such as whole car prices, maybe metals or maybe precious metals, I don't know. And what has also been the impact of mix, such as, for example, if you're selling these newer higher quality of more drivable vehicles, do you think we could see these types of increases for another quarter or two before you start to lap the difficult compares or maybe should we think about some sort of moderation beforehand done on whole car prices or something like that? Thanks. Jay Adair : First just a clarifying point to make sure I didn't misspeak, but our - I think our ASPs last quarter were up 26% year-over-year and this quarter were up 37%. So the increases is more meaningful this quarter than it was last quarter. Yes, we are at all time highs, and yes, I believe these are all time year-over-year changes as well in selling prices. You may have been away for a moment, we did comment a little earlier on the selling price trends in the business and what portion of it is quote durable and not. And I think there is likely some supply and demand characteristics here. But overall when we have seen volumes decline 13%, but average selling prices increase 37%, we conclude that the absolute dollars flowing to Copart auctions are meaningfully up year-over-year. So it's not just supply and demand, it's not just a fixed number of dollars pursuing a certain number of units, it's much more than that. To your question about mix, I think it is fair to say that as we've seen total loss frequency increase that, that benefits us in the form of ASPs because marginal totals generate higher selling prices at auction. I would note that that's also been a multiple year trend. Total loss frequency in 1980 was 4%, today it's probably north of 20%. So it's not something that's happened during the pandemic, per se. But it arguably has accelerated to some extent during the pandemic, but it's been a true phenomenon for many years. Which is one reason why until if memory serves until the third quarter of 2020 which was right when the pandemic hit, until then we had experienced ASP increases for 13 straight quarters or thereabouts. And that is a reflection of our marketing efforts by recruitment total loss frequency and the like. So some of - so no doubt, some portion of the - there are secular drivers then, that will lead ASPs up over the very long haul. To what extent today's 37% increase is purely a pandemic related phenomenon? Very difficult to say. It's certainly not all of it. Ryan Brinkman : And then just last question is, if you could weigh in on sort of the whole inflation versus deflation debate that's taking place may come in, we're seeing a lot of inflation in used car prices, but there is deflation in other areas like commercial real estate, et cetera. I was just thinking that if one was of the view that there is going to be materially higher inflation over the long run because of what's happening with - that the money supply and Federal Reserve or whatnot, I mean, you own all of your land, so that appreciates in value, won't face higher rent prices, and you get compensated as a percentage of transaction prices. How is the Company positioned to benefit or not from inflation? And is that part of - is that potentially part of the investment thesis here? Jeff Liaw : I'd say only indirectly so. So, as you know, for example, you cited one of the more important strategic decisions we have made and continue to make which is that owning our land is the - is the more correct approach to navigating the - our balance sheet. Even though on paper, any way you could arguably turbocharge return on equity by selling that land and leasing it back. We've concluded the strategic importance of controlling our own destiny, owning our land knowing that we can assure it's used for our customers for the next 50 years, outweighs the leverage benefit of a potentially more balance sheet efficient approach. One byproduct of that I think is some inflationary protection, that we do find ourselves in an inflationary environment, we are both landlord and tenant. So we are not subject to the potential risk you described. When it comes to inflation in general, inflation is certainly a fraught expression, and certain indices include or exclude durable goods like automobiles and real estate and the like, some exclude fuel. So, it's harder to comment on it in isolation. I would say in general, inflation does not - it doesn't enter our decision calculus very frequently when it comes to the strategic and operational decisions we make. So hard for - hard for me to know, I think you - and the - and Wall Street will certainly have a better perspective on this than we will. But it's not top of mind when it comes to the decisions we make. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, I'll turn it back to Jeff Liaw for closing remarks. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Well, thank you for the thoughtful questions and we look forward to talking to everyone on the next call. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Thanks. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency-related gains, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises.  We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets, including with the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31st, 2020 and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. And now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us, everyone, for our second quarter call here. We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion.  As an appropriate cap to a bizarre 12 months, we are now experiencing a major weather system in the U.S., of course, including here at headquarters in Dallas, where four inches of snow qualifies as a snowstorm of epic proportions.  So we start by extending our well wishes to our team, our customers and their families. And a special thanks this week to the Copart's headquarters team, including our tech people, operations, finance and accounting, for keeping us in business to serve our customers and in this case, our investors today as well without disruption.  The [natural questions] [ph] today will, of course, focus on the pandemic. Since our last call in November, we have all experienced firsthand the holiday season and therefore, the accelerating and now decelerating caseloads across the world. We've seen new viral strains. And of course, we are observing the emerging logistics challenges of the global vaccine distribution phenomenon as well.  And therefore, we've seen mobility modulate up and down over the course of that time as well. We have, throughout, remain honored to be recognized an essential business, as an essential business in serving our customers and the communities in which we do business. The themes remain overwhelmingly consistent. We have observed reducing activity, offset by the substitution of driving for other forms of transit, including air travel, buses, trains and the like. We continue to [observe] [ph] frequency that remains higher than what would have historically been projected given recent driving trends.  We've also observed higher total loss frequency in parts empowered by very strong returns at our auctions. If anything, our long-run views remain very much reinforced that the 40-year trend of rising total loss frequency remains the most important underlying driver of our business and has been a continuous trend despite some major macroeconomic disruptions over the course of the past 12 months. And pausing to reflect almost now a full year of pandemic life, I think we've remained incredibly true to our foundational principles. We continue to focus day-to-day on serving our customers exceptionally well in both good times and bad and snowstorms and otherwise. We've been flexible in accommodating their workflows. We have also noted the importance of auction liquidity, that being the flywheel of our marketplace business. At a time when others may well be retrenching, we continue to invest very substantial resources in growing our global buyer base. We continue to believe that physical capacity is a key enabler of our business as well, and have invested accordingly, including making some opportunistic purchases in -- over the course of the past year or so. And we certainly have seen the power of deploying technology in every corner of our business to make ourselves more efficient, our customers more efficient and to drive superior returns, as well in our auctions, in our member recruitment and retention efforts, in customer integration, in reporting loan payoff tools, our vehicle valuation tools and on and on and on. There is no end to the power of technology, both past, present and future in Copart. Our people and culture have also been remarkably durable and essential despite the disruptions of various remote work requirements, quarantines for exposure to coronavirus. And otherwise, it is the durability of Copart's culture, I think, that has proven to be the strongest thread that keeps us together. We've invested substantial resources throughout the pandemic and all of the above in the face of massive economic disruption. We continue to make decisions all day, every day to support our customers [for 20] [ph] years. That remains our horizon as we make day-to-day decisions. On our business specifically, we certainly did observe volume declines in the second quarter due to reduced driving activity and high car prices, of course, which, all else equal, would lead to fewer cars to being totaled, offset by higher-than-expected accident frequency, very strong auction [written] [ph], therefore and total loss frequency as well. Our global unit sales decreased by 13% for the quarter with a U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an international unit decline of approximately 15%. We've observed a slightly more pronounced international decline as certain countries in which that have implemented more severe shelter-in-place orders due to high COVID-19 case counts and population density as well. Within our U.S. non-insurance business, we continued the trend of seeing charities and wholesalers volumes contracting the most significantly, perhaps affected most directly by COVID-19. Excluding those two categories, our non-insurance volume continued its year-over-year growth trends. And in fact, our dealer business grew 10% year-over-year in unit volume, compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms. This is both a product of our auction liquidity, the flywheel I described a moment ago, and certainly a contributor to it as well. Every dealer car we earn the right to sell empowers us to serve our insurance customers still better with superior returns and vice-versa. Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1.1% versus a year ago. That is comprised of both a slight increase in U.S. inventory of 1% and a decline of 15% for international inventory, primarily driven by those countries, where we have experienced more severe COVID-19 lockdowns. On our average selling prices, they remain robust with substantial increases year-over-year. ASPs worldwide grew 35% for the quarter, with USP up 36%. And while there are various offsetting mix shift considerations for that U.S. number, our insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year in the U.S. as well. The natural question, of course, is how durable those are. We note that there are certainly favorable underlying drivers as well, including strong used car prices, folks like Manheim and NADA citing increases in values of 15% or thereabouts, substantial increases, but certainly shy of the mid-30% range that we've experienced firsthand. Our selling prices have grown, we think, as a reflection of our ongoing marketing member recruitment capabilities and broad global reach, with the exception of the one quarter at the beginning of the pandemic last year, we've now experienced 16 straight quarters of ASP increases year-over-year. International buyers, after experiencing a slight decline in terms of the mix of vehicles purchased at the height of the pandemic, are now purchasing cars again at a greater rate than before the pandemic, despite logistics challenges and the headaches that might come with shipping cars in 2021, a reflection of the decades long trends that we've discussed at great length previously. I think it's difficult to project any given month, any given quarter or year, but the secular trends for ASPs, including our international buyer recruitment and retention, total loss frequency certainly as well remain durable. We are grateful for our very strong financial performance this quarter, excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to discuss the second quarter financial results. John North : Thanks Jeff and good morning everybody. I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color and then we'll open it up for some questions. Global revenue increased $41.9 million or 7.3%, including a $2.2 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $22.6 million or 4.4% primarily due to higher ASPs. The US service revenue grew 4% and international experienced an increase of 7.2%. Purchased vehicle sales increased $19.3 million or 29.7% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes, partially offset by lower international volumes. US purchased vehicle revenue was up 48.3% over the prior year and international grew by 7.5%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $3.6 million overall. Global gross profit increased by $47.6 million or 18.3%. And our gross margin percentage improved by approximately 160 basis points to 49.8%. US margins improved from 47.6% to 52.2% and international margins increased from 32.8% to 37.6%. Both segments margin was driven primarily through increased ASPs, but was partially offset due to volume declines over fixed cost components, leading to higher cost per unit processed. I'll now move to the discussion of G&A excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. We continue to believe that we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long-term and we encourage you to review trend lines rather than a single quarter metric for a more accurate view of the business, particularly given the impact of COVID. With that said, our G&A spend was down $3.2 million from $39.2 million a year ago to $36.0 million in 2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 23% from $209.9 million to $258.2 million. We delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong fees, outpacing the impact of a lower absolute volume of vehicles, while controlling G&A costs. Net interest expense increased $400,000 or 8.6% year-over-year, due to reduced interest income on collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increased issuance cost and unused line of credit fees due to the -- by 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment. Q2 income tax expense was $59 million at a 23.4 effective tax rate, reflecting a $2.2 million benefit to size of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 24.2%. In summary, GAAP net income increased 14.7% from $168.7 million last year to $193.4 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 24.8% from $153.5 million last year, to $191.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 -- in the second quarter 2021, excuse me. For the first six months of fiscal 2021, GAAP net income increased to $393.7 million. And non-GAAP net income increased 23.0% to $379.8 million. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights, as of January 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity, comprised of $616.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $138.7 million over July 31, 2020. Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased modestly by $10 million, year-over-year to $134.5 million, primarily driven by working capital changes. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $124 million from the first quarter of 2021, due to seasonal factors that should reverse later in the year. We invested $136.1 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, and 85% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity, for additional business and creates an economic vote to potential market entrance, given the difficulty in-sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable growth enable us to continue to make decisions for long-term interest to both, our customers and our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Victor, we're happy to open it up for some questions. Question-and: Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll be having a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bob Labick : Congratulations on strong operating performance. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Bob Labick : I wanted to start with one of the comments you made, just to dig a little further, Jeff. You mentioned total loss frequency is one of the -- has been rising for 40 years. It's one of the keys to the investment thesis to the secular growth that you have. But there's also been, a 30-plus percent ASP rise over the last nine months plus. Has total loss frequency risen proportionately? Do you think there's more to come? Do you think -- what's the correlation between those? And how do you think it's going to play out going forward? Jeff Liaw : It's a great and very thorny question you raised. So I mentioned used car prices. I would use my track carefully as well. So if you -- let's separate a bunch of different variables at the same -- start with the used car prices, used car prices being high, by itself, would lead to fewer cars being totaled. To the extent that it helps to bring salvage auction values up, that can then increase total loss frequency to some extent as well. But your question really is to what extent are today's auction returns, being incorporated by insurance companies, into their total loss decisions. And I think the answer is partially, so. But I don't think, broadly speaking, folks have fully accounted for today's auction returns in terms of the total loss frequency. You've seen the uptick in total loss frequency, but it's in the 1% kind of range. I think if and when these prices prove durable, I think we would see total loss frequency up meaningfully still. Bob Labick : Got it. That's great. Thank you. And then, obviously, you guys were all going into the pandemic, but it still was a largely disruptive event for everyone. Can you talk about some of the biggest changes you've made to the business model as a result? And where that positions you going forward? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think the \u2013 we have the good benefit, Bob, in some respects of having been wired for disruptions like this even before we could expect them, meaning we have been an online-only auction platform, as you know, since 2003, so we didn't have to figure it out on the fly. We have been a global online auction house for literally decades. So that's been the single biggest help during the pandemic. Otherwise, we certainly had to make real-time accommodations to a number of our customers who have their own evolving workflows that now \u2013 they now wish to send fewer people to physical locations and so forth. So we have to find ways to accommodate that workflow and some mix of \u2013 through some mix of business process and technology deployments on our part to keep our own people safe and to reduce density in our facilities. We've deployed tools that help our members, our employees and our sellers reduce congestion. So they can go to the facilities at the right times and wait in their cars instead of coming into the facility and waiting in line physically. We certainly had to accommodate work-from-home arrangements for folks who have been quarantined, exposed or in high case count areas, where the restrictions are more severe. But by and large, we have, I'd say, much more business as usual in actionable practice than not in part because we had already been a digital business beforehand. Bob Labick : Okay. Got it. And then last one for me, I'll get back in queue. And I know you guys are always looking out three to five, 10 years in your planning. I was wondering if you could share with us the biggest changes in opportunities you see domestically and internationally over the next three to five or 10 years? Jeff Liaw : Incredibly open-ended question and probably a longer discussion than we can handle today, but we're certainly excited about our core business being the \u2013 I think you were citing our incumbent market, specifically. But in the US, I think we believe that, that rising total loss frequency is a huge opportunity for us, not just as the passive beneficiaries of it, but because we affect those results to some extent through our auction technology, our member recruitments. Building that global liquidity base is everything. And as we drive returns upwards, we can for our customers continue to achieve better returns and therefore, earn the right to sell still more of those cars. So bringing us back to the total loss frequency thesis you described a moment ago. Therefore, also, we can continue to grow our business in the non-insurance realms as well, including among automotive dealers. As our auction values rise as sort of liquidity grows and builds upon itself, we are the right outlet for [little more whole] [ph] cars as well. And that also is a large and substantial opportunity for us here in the US. Bob Labick : Okay. Terrific. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Most welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist Financial. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi. Good afternoon. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Stephanie. Stephanie Benjamin : Jeff, you got -- made an interesting comment. I don't think it's particularly unique, but you called out that your buyers are now buying at a greater rate than pre-COVID levels. Just given what we have seen with ASPs, I'd love to hear your thoughts on why you think the buyer base has been a little bit more active. I know you've made a lot of strides in building and expanding the buyer base, but the frequency is an interesting dynamic as well. So I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Sure. The observation was more \u2013 a part that in the height of the pandemic, which I think of as the \u2013 the pandemic uncertainty, perhaps the spring and summer of 2020, and also compounded then by many of our buyer currencies having - relative to the US dollar. We've seen -- and these are all in small percentage point changes definitely to be fair. These aren't titanic shifts of any sort. But we've seen their buying power compressed by virtue of their currencies. Now sitting here in \u2013 after this quarter, we've now seen international buyers purchasing the most cars on a percentage basis relative to our total units sold that they have bought since before pre \u2013 since pre-pandemic levels. So I think it's a reflection of ongoing demand, more the 40-year trends, more that our [rect] [ph] cars are incredibly valuable as drivable cars to many other countries around the world. So I think that's really the phenomenon as you note, supported by our marketing and technology efforts to build upon that buyer base. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you. And then I was wondering, if you could just provide a little bit of an update on your efforts to build out your presence in Germany? Jeff Liaw : Sure. In Germany, I think, the economic thesis, which we described at great length in a couple of calls in 2019 \u2013 or fiscal 2019, so certainly we would direct other \u2013 direct others to go there. I know you've read it carefully. But the underlying thesis is that the status quo today is a disservice to insurance carriers and to their policyholders both \u2013 both in economic terms and experiential ones. And at the Copart auction model, which we have deployed, as you know, at great scale in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil and elsewhere. It generates better economic outcomes for everyone involved and better experiential outcomes as well. Our experience there, including during the pandemic, has done nothing, but reinforced that. We are \u2013 as noted a few calls ago, we are selling consigned vehicles on behalf of a number of the top insurance carriers in Germany. We are continuing to invest in our technology, our land, our people, our marketing efforts. Ultimately, we think it is our business process, our global buyer base and our technology which will ultimately allow us to prevail. We have the roles. We are incredibly excited. As you might imagine, the pandemic itself is an interesting catalyst. It is -- it shakes up the status quo to some extent. But in other respects, it also can rest \u2013 meetings that otherwise might have happened in working sessions and so forth with insurance carriers. But the underlying thesis is as strong as ever. Our results -- our auction results there continue to demonstrate a superior outcome relative to the status quo, which ultimately benefits the insurance carriers and benefits the policyholders as well because they don't have an owner-retained rect vehicle and ultimately, because this will drive insurance rates down as well. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Good morning, Jeff and John. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to take another crack at deconstructing ARPU trends over the last several years really. To what extent is the higher ARPU due to services that you didn't even offer five years ago? I'm thinking like loan payoff or other fee-for-service opportunities that are available on the platform that maybe just weren't available five years ago? Jeff Liaw : Craig, clarifying question. ARPU, what's your arithmetic? Craig Kennison : Well, I'm just thinking, I mean, you've got a big trend, obviously, a big movement in your average selling price and overall revenue per unit, which I can't remember the number you cited on the call, but obviously, this quarter was up a lot. We know that there are several factors driving it, and I'm trying to just get a -- probe really one issue, which is maybe you're offering features and capabilities today that you didn't offer in the past, and that would partially explain the growth in that metric? Jeff Liaw : It does partially, but only partially. So a minority of that would be explained by additional services. We do think we offer the best suite of seller services in the business, including the loan payoff tool you mentioned a moment ago various title services and the like. But the majority of what I think you're calling ARPU growth, which is the comparison of our revenue change relative to our units sold change, there is some principal mix in there as well. So principal mix can throw that math off in ways that overstate its economic importance, as you know. But that aside, it is principally driven by strong auction returns, which then, in turn, of course, generates higher revenue for Copart as well. Craig Kennison : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe somewhat related, but it goes to the platform itself. I'm just -- you've continued to innovate this platform, but you don't like to talk as much about that innovation. I'd be curious to know what you achieved in 2020 that -- what features did you develop in 2020 that your buyers or sellers embraced? And I'm just thinking about the tools that build confidence in the buyer, especially whether it's pictures, sounds, facts or like inspection services. I'm just learning -- looking to learn more about innovation in 2020. Jeff Liaw : I think as you might know, Craig, I think we are quite delighted to invest aggressively in innovation and to talk about it at great length, but principally with the actual audiences themselves, with the sellers and the members alike. But when it comes to building member confidence, to us, it is a matter of reducing friction as well. So ensuring a seamless auction platform participation for those buyers, whether it's from their desktop or from their phones, increasingly, we are mobile-first as they are as well. So ensuring the frictionless experience for them in purchasing cars, paying for cars, registering as a member, et cetera. There are dozen scores of individual innovations that I won't cite in great detail here, the audience. But that is -- the principle of it is that, is that we want excellent visibility, excellent transparency and a frictionless experience from both the member and the seller side as well. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : When you think about the dealer cars, I mean, still growing pretty significantly. How are they impacting ASPs? I would imagine -- or maybe you could give us some idea as sort of the average value of the dealer cars? And at what point does the dealer mix become large enough that it starts to support the ASP average by itself? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it's a good question. And one reason we went ahead and proactively disclosed, because I think the intuition is fair that if dealer volume is up 10% year-over-year and the ASPs are higher than those of your insurance cars, to what extent is it contributing to ASP growth? And the answer is, yes, it contributes, but it's offset by other mix effects as well. So that US insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year, right? So, it is not, by and large, the story for ASP change year-over-year for this quarter. Over time, it certainly could have that effect as well. As you know, the total of our non-insurance business is in the order of the 20% kind of range. So, it won't. We will still be largely driven by insurance changes for the next X quarters and years. But over time, yes, they will continue to grow that dealer business and it will nudge our ASPs upward as well. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then in the past, you've talked about what percentage of IP addresses were either foreign or maybe brokers on behalf of foreign buyers. Could you give us an update on that number, or at least maybe some idea what -- an idea maybe what percentage of vehicles sold windup in export now? Jeff Liaw : --: There are international IP addresses that we know are for buyers who intend to export cars. There are international IP addresses that we know are not. They're literally for US buyers who have outsourced or located their purchasing operations outside the US and we purposely exclude them as well. So, the output of that analysis is circa 40% of our units are purchased by those international buyers. Now, I qualify that by saying that 90% plus of our cars are -- have their values affected by international buyers, because they bid on many, many more cars still than they buy. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to start on a bit more of a near-term one before a longer term question, Jeff. When we look at the volume backdrop near-term, miles driven appear to have stagnated here kind of down 10%-ish, but total loss rates going higher. I guess as we look forward, do you expect the gains we've seen in total loss rate just stay this year? We saw kind of a step function change during into pandemic. Do you think the industry holds onto the? And then related, what is your expectation for miles driven as we look out 12 to 24 months on the US business here? Jeff Liaw : On the first question, yes, is there some blip at some moment where somehow it is down slightly year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter when it -- suppose that's possible. But when I look at the 40-year trend line, which we mentioned a few moments ago, I think total loss frequency in 19 -- get my date straight, 1980 was 4% or so. And 40 years later, its north of 20%. So, it's a five-fold increase in the past 40 years. I think that's an inexorable march to 30%, 40% and beyond. Whether there are near-term technical blips that caused it to change in a given quarter, I think it's totally plausible, but I think the 40-year trend is unassailable. To your other question about miles driven, unfortunately, I think we see tons of data. So I think since November, we have tons of data. I'm not sure we have tons of incremental insight there beyond what you and others would cite as well in the EIA\u2019s data, Google, Apple, INRIX, et cetera. We study those same trends. And I think underlying them are all the same questions about proliferation of the vaccine, when the kids go back to school, when leisure travel resumes, air travel resumes. I think they are so many variables that are upstream of that question, even driving activity to say nothing of Copart volume, that it's somewhat speculation on our part to give you any kind of number or even a range.  That said, I think we are preparing ourselves. And when it comes to our business, investing in technology and in land for a growth -- ultimate growth environment, I don't know if that's coming in six months or more. That remains to be seen. But I think we are prepared for it. Daniel Imbro : Yes. That's helpful. Moving over to the international operations. I want to dig in, in the U.K., Brazil, Germany, how much are you doing on the non-insurance side over there? I would think with your global buyer base digitally native, you could probably give them a pretty good dealer market over there compared to what they have? But I'm curious how that opportunity looks and how achievable you think that will be? Jeff Liaw : I think the answer is similar that, in that, where we have very substantial liquidity as we do here in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, U.K., et cetera, we are, therefore, a very attractive platform for other non-insurance cars as well. So I think your hypothesis is fair and accurate. Daniel Imbro : Got it. And then last one for me. Jeff, you mentioned shipping rates and logistics headwinds are weighing on the international buyer. Is that -- frankly, I think the buyer bears the cost of shipping. So that's just a lack of available shipping containers. And then are you guys forecasting that sustains for a while here, or what, kind of, the shipping outlook look like from your standpoint? Jeff Liaw : Yes. You are correct that the logistics are the responsibility of the buyer. I think the disruptions were more severe, frankly, in the middle of last year than they are now. But that has weighed, to some extent, on those international buyers. And that -- the reason for sharing that context is that, against that backdrop, they are now at pre-pandemic levels in terms of the share of cars they're actually purchasing in the international markets. So I don't -- anything I can share with you would just be anecdotal, by and large, based on what we've heard from our members. I gather it's a condition today, but not a major one. Daniel Imbro : I appreciate it. Best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one is clerical. Did you give the non-insurance mix this quarter for the U.S.? John North : Sorry, can you repeat that? You broke up a little bit? Chris Bottiglieri : Sorry. I\u2019m having connection issues. Did you give a non-insurance mix in the call? John North : Yes. It's about 20%. Chris Bottiglieri : 20%. Got down a little bit. Okay. And I guess my question was, so dealer consignment was up more than insurance. It sounds like non-insurance was down a little bit, but what were some of the mitigating factors that hurt the ARPU growth? You talked about mix effects. Just trying to understand the channels that would have been weaker that would have hurt ARPU? John North : Well, our insurance ASPs are up in ARPU. We're probably completing a few things there, Chris. So if you start \u2013 let's just state ASPs, which are not revenue for us, right? And there, the insurance selling went up 36%. Dealer prices also went up. They didn't go up 36%, right? So that is a quite headwind relative to the overall 36%. That is offset by the mix shift benefits of those dealer cars. We did, as we noted during the prepared remarks, see a decline in sureties and wholesaler volumes to some extent. And that is also, frankly, ASP supportive by itself, right, because they are lower-value cars that are declining as a share of the overall mix. John North : Chris, this is John. Just to jump in. The number was 22% of total volume in the quarter, not \u2013 I said approximately 20%. It's 22%. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Perfect. That actually went up. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a big picture question. From what I could tell, it seems like you took more share in dealer consignment this quarter than last quarter just based on what one of your peers reported yesterday, a few days ago. Is that, what you're seeing? And then two, is there something that COVID that's eroding the barriers to entry in dealer consignment? Is there anything you're doing differently to win more accounts from dealers? Just want to hear your perspective on, how you're able to accelerate market share gains in dealer consignment right now? Jeff Liaw : Give me that first half of the question again, Chris? The second one I got. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay. Sorry, I apologize, if I'm breaking up. The snowstorms killed my service. Yes, the first question is, it seems that you're taking share in dealer consignment, right? It looks like relative to last quarter, your share actually accelerated just based on your growth rate and the market growth rate. So just trying to understand what \u2013 if that's what you're seeing from your own data that you're taking share was the first part. Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think, based on what we can tell from publicly available information for other dealer auction platforms, yes. We are outgrowing other participants in the industry. I would describe our practices during the pandemic as largely a continuation of our trends. We have a terrific internal sales team that pursues those dealers. I think we have benefited from having been this online auction platform, global auction platform forever. So if the right buyer for your car is 10 miles away, he or she will own it. If the right buyer for your car is in Poland or Nigeria, he or she will own it. So that global marketplace, I think, has been our most important tool in our belt, when it comes to winning those dealer accounts. It is not per se a major strategic shift. But because we were online throughout, there are certainly other participants in the industry who are more accustomed to physical auctions or hybrid auctions, et cetera. And we have been certainly relatively less disrupted than some of them. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your question. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning all. Hey, Jeff, John, what was the US revenue growth and the international revenue growth? I couldn't write that down quick enough. John North : US service revenue was 4.4% \u2013 sorry, global was 4.4%. US was 4%, and international was 7.2%. Gary Prestopino : And revenue growth? Yes. Go ahead. John North : Yes, that was... Jeff Liaw : Service. John North : Service revenue. For purchased vehicles, it's 29.7 U.S. is 48.3, and international was 7.5. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Just a question on your dealer vehicles, I mean, are you seeing your platform being used moving, I guess, up the value channel? The impression, I always had when this was initially started that you were kind of trying to dis-intermediate maybe the wholesaler that was getting the 12 to 15 year old car awful lot. It seems that as you're gaining share here. Are you seeing your platform almost play out to the extent that it's mimicking some of the other online services that are out there on a dealer-to-dealer market basis? Jeff Liaw : That direct comparison is harder for us to comment on, Gary. I think your general observation is fair, though, that \u2013 I agree, as our overall pool vehicles evolves over time, if you just took a picture of what a Copart car looked like in 1990 versus what a Copart \u2013 the median Copart car looks like in 2020, the car in 1990 was much more heavily wrecked, physically speaking, right? Cars were more readily repairable than they are today. And today, if a couple of sensors are knocked out, then the cars can be totaled much more readily in part because the returns are better on the back end as well. And therefore, the overall pool of the liquidity has evolved as well. And more and more whole cars are directly addressable by our buyer base as well. So to your overall question, yes, we are being up the value chain. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I know you've gotten a number already around the non-insurance business. I thought to ask a couple more, including if you're able to say what percent of your non-insurance volume is truly whole car as opposed to, I guess, salvage cars that are sourced outside of insurance companies? And are whole cars more profitable vehicles for you to sell because they transact at higher prices? Is there anything else to think about? Like, for example, on the self fee side, like if there are smaller dealers selling the vehicles, maybe they don't get the volume discounts that your customers are selling tens of thousands of vehicles do, making it even more profitable. And then just finally, I'm curious, if there are certain parts of the whole car market that you're targeting now such as dealers, but maybe there are other segments or categories of sellers that you've not gotten into yet, which might offer future growth opportunities? Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Ryan. Insightful questions, some we can address more transparently than others. In short, the \u2013 in short, we certainly believe that the \u2013 as total loss frequency rises, as the character of the vehicles that we sell changes and that pool of liquidity evolves over time, but yes, still more of transacted vehicles become addressable through Copart's platform in short. As for the profitability or the mix thereof, the dealers are not the majority of it, but a very important portion of our non-insurance business, of course, that business is profitable to us. We won't comment on relative fees paid by our customers, in part because the services we provide them also vary greatly as well. But it is a profitable business for us. It is important to us. It also, as I noted in the prepared remarks, also helps us serve insurance customers better as well. They are all mutually supportive of one another because of the liquidity phenomenon. When we win that dealer car, it attracts still more buyers who have been on insurance cars and vice-versa. And so as we total -- as we help insurance carriers, total cars that are more and more marginal from their point of view, that also attracts more buyers, which also, therefore, attracts more dealer cars as well as those other sources that you may have in mind. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, very helpful. Thanks. And then, just lastly on the winter weather outside your office window, should investors be thinking about that as a potential tailwind to both revenue and profits, or is it more of a surge or cat-type volume that also comes with a higher cost? Jeff Liaw : It's a fair question. I have to confess, despite having grown up here, to not have tremendous experience with Texas snowstorms to be fair. So I think we'll see how this unfolds over the course of the next few weeks. Typically, the major challenge in flooding, the major rainstorms and windstorms is that cars are stranded in all kinds of different places that require very urgent pickups. I think in this -- we have seen certainly reduced driving activity. This is pandemic effects turbo charge still in terms of driving activity and such. But we are deploying many of our resources to address this question. Many of our owned, company-owned trucks, our people who are on -- like this, we're deploying as well. So I don't know what the ultimate financial impact will be. But we're, I think, well-prepared to handle it regardless. Ryan Brinkman : Interesting. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. Jeff Liaw : Great. Well, thank you for joining us for the second quarter call. We look forward to talking to you in a few months. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effects of certain discrete income tax items, foreign currency-related gains, certain income tax benefits, and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, and uncertainties in our markets including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. So, with the disclosure out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Liaw, our President. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, John. We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. I want to start first by extending a thank you to our team in the field around the world and here at headquarters for their resilience and agility over the past 14-months. For over a year now, we face the challenge of providing excellent service to our customers while keeping our people and communities safe, and I'm grateful and proud for our team for having delivered on both. We take very seriously our responsibility as an essential business in keeping our roads and support infrastructure clear for the movement of people and things. I'll start with some of the key statistics that we share each quarter, and I'll close with some remarks about the future before turning it over to John for a review of the financial results specifically. For the quarter, we experienced a global unit sales increase of 3% for the quarter with a U.S. increase of 4.5% and an international decline of 5%. We have observed more pronounced shutdowns internationally in certain countries in which we operate, and they are likewise adopting more protracted reopening plans than we're experiencing here in the U.S. Our insurance business specifically was slightly below the third quarter 2020 volumes, down approximately 3%, but effectively flat with 2019. This is the product of lower driving activity, of course, as driving activity remains suppressed relative to the norm and also decreased claims frequency offset by increases in total loss frequency and share gain. Our US non-insurance business grew approximately 30% in unit volume year-over-year. This is also a reflection of strong used vehicle price environment combined with our auction liquidity and sales efforts across non-insurance categories. Our dealer business, in particular, increased 26% in unit volume year-over-year compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms that serve dealers. This is a reflection of the flywheel effect we've talked about on earnings calls previously. Our growing auction liquidity enables us to serve an expanding set of vehicles, and then those additional vehicles, of course, further enhance our liquidity as well. Our global inventory at the end of April increased 16% versus a year ago, and that's comprised of a year-over-year increase of 21% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory, a reflection of the dynamics described a moment ago. On average selling prices, our ASPs increased worldwide 48% year-over-year for the quarter. Our ASP strength is a reflection of both market dynamics as well as our own member recruitment, and member recruitment and retention efforts as we cultivate more buyers worldwide. We'll comment more on that in a moment as well. The ASP increase is not primarily due to mix shift effects. Our insurance ASPs in the U.S., for example, were up more than 50% year-over-year. And while growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling price growth has far exceeded the overall used car price environment, a reflection again of our marketing and member recruitment capabilities and our broad global reach to emerging economies who are increasingly buyers of vehicles from our markets. Our auction liquidity itself also continues to grow as we observed sequentially and year-over-year, more domestic and international bidders and bids per unit, a reflection both of supply growth for us as well as our active cultivation of those buyers. The natural questions that we would all pose would be what\u2019s the aftermath of the pandemic might be to our business. It's certainly challenging to separate signal from noise given the abundance of confounding [ph] and extreme variables at the moment. My comments will largely be U.S.-centric but will apply by and large to the rest of our markets as well. I thought I'd take a minute to talk about some of our long-term assumptions and how they may have been affected or not by the pandemic. First on driving activity, it does appear to be rebounding, but certainly still suppressed relative to pre-pandemic levels, in particular, with commuting traffic still down 25% to 30% or more based on sources like Google Maps, among others. Due to increasing vaccine availability, there is certainly line of sight to reopening more fully here in the U.S., and our other markets appear to be three to six months or thereabouts behind the reopening sequence of the U.S. Longer-term, we continue to expect modest increases in per capita driving as we've observed over the past 50 years. Mobility remains essential for employment, education, healthcare, leisure, and every other aspect of our existence. We do anticipate perhaps some increase in virtual work arrangements but offset by a shift from various forms of other mass transit in favor of driving. Accident and claims frequency have declined during the pandemic, as you know, though with increasing severity due to higher speed driving and increase in distracted driving. Long-term, we expect a continuation of a decade-long trend to a very modest decline in accident frequency over time due to the gradual penetration of safety technologies in new car shipments, which then in turn eventually make their way to the operating fleet. We do, however, expect an increasing severity over time as well as those safety technologies also become more expensive to repair as well. On the question of our average selling prices, I would note the longer-term trend in favor of higher ASPs. Certainly, there have been near-term pandemic effects. But over time, say over 10-years plus, it has been demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our markets, from the U.S., from UK, Canada, Germany, Spain, the Middle East and Finland and elsewhere, combined with our member cultivation efforts that have driven ASP growth over time. I'd acknowledge that we're seeing an unusual historic moment for used car valuations given the supply shortage for new cars, but we have experienced with the exception of the third quarter of last year the very beginning of the pandemic. We\u2019ve now experienced year-over-year increases in prices for 17 straight quarters. So, we think that there are elements of the selling prices certainly that will prove much more durable over time. Our operating and strategic decisions are predicated on the expectation of volume recovery post-pandemic as well as long-term growth post pandemic, largely consistent dramatically with what we've experienced over the past 40 years. We're grateful for our strong financial performance this quarter, and excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North. John North : Thank you, Jeff. As we mentioned, I'll make a few brief comments on our results to provide a little more color on the earlier remarks, and then we'll be happy to take a few questions this morning. Global revenue increased $184 million or 33%, including an $8 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $132 million or 27%, primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 27%, and international experienced an increase of 23%. Purchased vehicle sales increased $51 million or 87% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 103% over the prior year, and international grew by 64%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by almost $11 million overall. Global gross profit increased by $138 million or 57%, and our gross margin percentage improved by approximately 788 [ph] basis points to 52%. U.S. margins improved from 46% to 55%, and international margins increased from 32% to 37%. For both segments, margin improvement was driven primarily by higher ASPs. Moving to G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and G&A and depreciation expense, our spend increased $2.2 million from $37 million a year ago to $39 million in 2021. We anticipate G&A will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter but will continue to improve as a percentage of revenue over time as we grow. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 68% from $195 million to $328 million. We delivered 926 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and controlling costs. Net interest expense decreased $0.2 million or 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lapping last year's decision to draw on our revolver in the initial days of the pandemic to ensure adequate liquidity. Q3 income tax expense was $36.7 million, at a 11.4% effective tax rate, reflecting a $20 million tax benefit from the effect of certain discrete income tax items and a $5 million tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options, both of which have been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP earnings, included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 19%. In summary, GAAP net income increased 95% from $147 million last year to $267 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefits described above, non-GAAP net income increased $89.8 million from $138 million last year to $262 million in the third quarter of '21. For the first nine months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased 27% from $534 million last year to $681 million this year, and non-GAAP net income increased 44% from $447 million last year to $642 million this year. Now to briefly highlight our liquidity and cash flow. As of April 30, we had $2 billion of liquidity comprised of $912 million of cash and cash equivalents, and an undrawn revolving credit facility with a capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $434 million over July 31, 2020. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $75 million year-over-year to $369 million, primarily driven by stronger earnings that were partially offset by working capital consumed by building consignment on inventory. We invested $81.2 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, approximately 95% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates a wider economic moat for potential market entrants given the difficulty in sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable cash flow enable us to continue to make decisions for the long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. And with that, that's the end of our prepared remarks. We're happy to take some questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Pete Lucas : Yes. Hi, good morning. It's Pete Lucas for Bob. Just wondering if you could discuss how -- if you could just talk about how increased supply demand imbalance impacts auctions other than price, i.e. are cars selling faster, is less service needed, your ability to raise fees, anything you can comment there. Jeff Liaw : Pete, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I entirely follow, but certainly the high -- if you're talking about the strong used car price environment, I think it has helped with conversion on the margin of consigned vehicles, customer dealers. But, by and large, I don't think there are any unusual effects other than what has already been reflected in price. Everything else in terms of bidding activity, of course, has been true for many years where we talk about having more domestic and international bidders and bids and bids per unit, that's been a recurring theme since before the pandemic. Pete Lucas : Great. Thanks. And sticking with dealers, you mentioned there, can you just kind of talk about, I think you\u2019ve mentioned Copart taking some significant share there. What advantages or disadvantages does Copart have? And in terms of dealer cars, are you seeing them sell disproportionately internationally or domestically or a similar mix to your overall \u2026? Jeff Liaw : I'd say in the first instance, it\u2019s similar but indexed more internationally because they tend to be higher-value cars than our insurance cars. Of course, the insurance mix will include some very low value cars that end up transacting almost locally, though economically the ones that matter of course are the higher end units. Those tend to go internationally as do the dealer cars as well. In terms of the share capture that you described, as with all of our customers, what matters to them are the results in the end and what are the delivered prices that we can achieve at auction. So, it's auction liquidity and prices that matter the most to dealers by far, and we continue to deliver for them, and thus earn the right to sell still more of their cars. Pete Lucas : Great. And just one last one for me sticking with dealer cars. Do all your dealer cars go to a Copart location or can you sell them without bringing them to a yard? And if not, do you anticipate being able to do that in the future? Jeff Liaw : I think we're today not commenting long term on where our products might go. Today, when a vehicle sells either before or after it is sold, it is brought to a Copart location. Pete Lucas : Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter, and I'll jump back in the queue. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Pete. Operator : Our next question is from Stephanie Benjamin with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Benjamin : Hi, good afternoon. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Stephanie. Stephanie Benjamin : I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the demand levels you're seeing, particularly from international buyers. Do you feel like they're buying at a greater rate than we saw pre-COVID levels? I'm just trying to get a function of what has been lower assignments versus the supply side and just the demand level. So, I'm just trying to get an idea of how healthy the buyers are at this point of time. Jeff Liaw : I would describe the buyers as very healthy in the aggregate. The international buyers are purchasing \u2013 are bidding and purchasing at plus or minus the same rates as they were pre-pandemic. Now, that's with everything having shifted very meaningfully with ASPs up 48%. They tend to buy higher value cars on average than our domestic buyers, and their activity has grown proportionately during the pandemic. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you. And then I'd love to get an update on where you stand internationally, particularly with the Germany operation and continuing to switch over to a consignment model. I believe beforehand, you were doing some pilots with the consignment model, so any update there. Jeff Liaw : Briefly, so we continue to invest in Germany in the form of land, technology, people, and infrastructure. We are as you know selling vehicles on a consignment basis for multiple insurance carriers as well as selling vehicles as a principle there as well, as I think we described in much, much greater detail, probably six, seven, eight earnings calls ago. But we continue to make good progress there. The key linchpin as you noted being to convert the markets to a Copart style auction and gross settlement away from the historical listings service/net settlement model. The results continue to bear out. This is an economically superior path for insurance carriers long term as well as a superior policyholder experience as well. So, nothing has particularly changed in our approach, and our results continue to warrant further investment in Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe. Stephanie Benjamin : Got it. And then last for me more high level. I'm curious, especially given the events over the last year as well as some significant investments that you guys have made, but when you guys have conversations with your insurance customers as well as even some of your non-insurance customers [indiscernible] business is growing. What are they asking for from you guys as a preferred partner and what are they looking for in terms of services, digital tools, and has that changed at all in the last year? Jeff Liaw : Great question, Stephanie. I think it has changed. I think there is certainly much more virtual work being done by all participants in the ecosystem, ourselves included, but certainly our insurance carriers among others of our sellers. They want more handled virtually, more by phone, more by text, more through our various applications that we provide to them, so that's certainly one of the demands that we have met. It has helped that we've been natively digital so to speak. We've been operating online-only auctions since 2003, so this is already a language that we spoke fluently. We've already been operating internationally, so we know what it means to operate this business remotely in many cases, and we're able to do so well and to accommodate our customers who in some cases had not been accustomed to such an approach. So, those are some of the specific pandemic-related requests we've gotten for certainly video services or virtual communication in lieu of in-person interaction. Stephanie Benjamin : Great. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions as well. It's really a big picture question that goes to one of your core advantages, which I think is your member consolidation and cultivation globally. How would you frame the size and scale of your global buyer network and how does it compare to your competition? Jeff Liaw : I think the latter half of your question, Craig, harder for us to opine on, since we don't have firsthand visibility into their own buyer network. But, I would say, this is largely the result of having what I think is a multiple decade advantage in pursuing the international markets. Being online, I think is essential to accessing that portion of the marketplace. We have been investing for years in physical and digital media, in physical infrastructure and physical presence in those markets. We respond to early signs of a market showing promise as buyers of Copart vehicles. We also will anticipate certain markets that make sense for Copart vehicles and plant seeds there. So, this is the product of multiple decades of investments in that regard, which we think ultimately manifests itself at auction in the form of returns, but comparatively difficult for us to know. We do believe it's a distinct advantage for us. Craig Kennison : Thanks, Jeff. And then John, maybe, could you frame your CapEx outlook for this year, and maybe the next couple of years, and where you expect to target your investment dollars? Jeff Liaw : I think, in short, Craig, we are still very much in investment mode. So, you may remember from, if I get my date straight, probably the May 2016 earnings call, when we launched the 20/20/20 initiative, which was to open 20 new yards and expand 20 yards inside of 20 months. As it turns out that was not nearly ambitious enough, we have far exceeded that and continue to expect to invest in land and infrastructure for at least the next few years. I think this is always a dynamic question. As you know, Craig, it takes a long time to permit and acquire land. We've taken the pandemic as an opportunity into opportunistically turn it up to buy land, perhaps or buy or permit land and perhaps would have previously been difficult to pursue. So, we view ourselves very much still in investment mode. Craig Kennison : And lastly, maybe just a follow-up on the land acquisition piece. When you buy land, to what extent you have knowledge of potential share gains that would immediately consume that land or is it not the case that you can kind of align your share gain opportunity with where you acquire that property? Jeff Liaw : I think our aperture is wider than that. It\u2019s not per se customer-specific or even time-bound or narrowly so. I think we buy land when we are currently congested or foresee potential congestion and are serving the industry broadly, and that could include market share gain in certain markets, but it's about being a good steward of industry owning this land to make sure that we can control our own destiny and deliver that service for our customers for the next 50 years, not the next three. So, in short, yes, those kinds of account-specific considerations certainly factor into our decisions, but overwhelmingly, it's more about just having enough to serve the industry today and tomorrow. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : To follow-up on that CapEx question, I guess, if you could talk maybe about land investment in U.S. versus international markets, sort of how much of that CapEx is weighted to geographic expansion? And then if you could talk a little bit about capacity utilization, you talked about when you feel congestion building out incremental real estate, but could you maybe give us a feeling for capacity utilization as we stand? Jeff Liaw : Sure. To your first question, the strong majority of the capital expenditures is still in what I think, in your mind we would characterize as incumbent Copart markets, so that's the UK, Canada, U.S., and Brazil, with growth to come in Germany and Spain and Western Europe, but that is certainly not a very substantial portion of the CapEx to-date. Your second question Bret was? Bret Jordan : Capacity utilization, we sort of looked at your existing real estate footprint, what are we utilizing? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, capacity utilization, a challenging subject to address directly in part, because our land is not fungible as you know. So, having excess capacity in city one or in Salt Lake City, for example did not benefit you at all in Minneapolis or in Miami. And so, it ends up being a microeconomic decision, not a macroeconomic one. So, we don't actually track measure or reports per se on capacity utilization on U.S. wider, certainly globally speaking. We look so within metropolitan areas. And so, capacity utilization, then we target our CapEx based on where capacity utilization is either high today, or it could be high -- or it could be high in a catastrophic event. We will factor all of that into those microeconomic decisions, but it isn't, by and large, an overall global. We are 2% higher than we were a year ago. That's not a metric that guides our business. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a quick question on ASP. You\u2019ve said that it was not really mix-driven, but it sounds like the dealer cars are typically higher value. Could you sort of just give us sort of a description of what a dealer car looks like versus the company average, maybe transaction value? And is the fee structure comparable for dealer cars as it is for the insurance business? Jeff Liaw : Our auction platform regardless of the source of the vehicle has the same fee structure, so to speak. So, as a buyer at one of our auctions, you would be indifferent as to the source of the vehicle. In terms of the selling price, we haven't provided that specific disclosure, but it is higher, meaningfully higher than our average insurance car, though they over time I think is the rising insurance values as well. It is decreasing total loss frequency. It is the safety technology that makes the typical Copart salvage car look a whole lot more like a drivable car than a wrecked vehicle that will be parted or dismantled or melted down for metal. It's that big shift over time, I think is expanding the relevant dealer universe to us as well. So, there is some overlap, [indiscernible], we view them as both curves. The curve for the dealer car certainly has its midpoint higher than the curve for insurance vehicles, but with heavy and increasing overlap as well. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yep. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff, you noted the increased buyers, particularly in emerging markets are improving liquidity. First, sorry if I missed this, but did you provide global bidder growth or buyer activity growth in the quarter? And then secondly, are we seeing the mix of international bidders increase from newer countries or is this further penetration of existing markets where you\u2019ve already kind of have a foothold? Jeff Liaw : Okay, fair question. We didn't disclose specifically the percentage increase, so to speak, but did note that we're increasing domestic buyers' bids and bids per unit both domestically and internationally for the quarter. So, I think we -- and that has been true for many quarters. You can go back and check the transcripts, and I think we've said that virtually every time we've been on the phone. In terms of the mix of countries that is -- both are true. There are some microeconomic [ph] considerations here, some countries will have a stronger currency one quarter than others or one year than others. And so, you'll see some shift over time. You'll see local economic variables also fluctuate, obviously all dwarfed by the pandemic, so that's the ultimate confounding variable. But in general, we'll see countries ebb and flow. I think that's the benefit of having a true global platform that's online, is that we smooth all of that activity in effect by accessing the world's economies period [ph]. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. And to follow-up on that, just a theoretical question on the international buyer, if prices keep going up at auction, which it makes sense why they are and maybe why they will, is there a limit or a natural limit, where they still need to make money on the backside of that purchase to where ARPU or ASPs cannot continue to increase or maybe how do you guys think about that just longer-term as factoring in your business? Jeff Liaw : I think, the specific answer to the question is for an individual buyer, certainly there is some truth to that, that they have to make a margin for whatever their ultimate activity is to rebuild the car, restore the car, and sell it again into a used car price environment. So, certainly for a given buyer, they would tap at it at some point. I think the reason, however, that our international demand has grown so much is that it's not a static buyer. The number of countries and the population share of that country, which has access to an automobile and will want access to an automobile is what drives international demand over time. So, it's that there are more countries with more of a desire for US, UK, Canadian, Middle East used cars, that's what drives the growth over time, not a specific buyer per se, but there are more countries -- as countries grow wealthier. But as you well know, the U.S. and Western Europe have the richest economies, and certainly China and Japan and Asian countries as well. But, in most cases, the wealthiest countries per capita have the most cars per capita, also have the slowest GDP growth rates as well. So, the faster growing economies with an appetite for vehicles that you and I and everyone on this call takes for granted very much wants access to a vehicle for education, for employment, for healthcare, leisure, all the reasons we cited a moment ago. And that trend, I think, is a 50-year trend that will not evade. Daniel Imbro : That's perfect, really helpful color. And then last one on the non-insurance. I think you mentioned total units were up 30%, dealers were up 26%. Both are impressive, but that does imply that something else within the non-insurance is, as you know up well over 30% to bring that average up. Curious what other sources of volume within non-insurance were outperforming this quarter to get you to that 30% unit growth? Jeff Liaw : I think, it's probably not -- I think sharing that level of detail I think will may be sharing more noise than signal, but in general, the rest of that segment includes charities cars, wholesalers, rental car fleets, banks, and the like. So, as you know, non-insurance is a bit of a catch all for us. We certainly think of them individually as separate businesses or separate customer sets to serve. And collectively, as you know, they grew more than that 26%, but I think more detail on that would be more confusing than helpful. Daniel Imbro : Got it. Fair enough. Thanks so much and best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Ali Faghri : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, starting on the pricing strength, is there anything that's occurred during the pandemic, changes in the industry dynamics or your company specifically that would suggest ASPs could remain structurally higher even after some of the more cyclical factors like constrained used car supply and higher pricing normalized? Jeff Liaw : Ali, I think what I'd point you to is before the pandemic even, I think it would have been three straight years, maybe more than that every quarter year-over-year increases in ASPs. I think the total loss frequency dynamic is the most important driver of our business long term, and it naturally drives ASPs upward. As insurance carriers find it more economically rational, more economically favorable to total more cars over time, those marginal cars are better and better vehicles, less damaged. They are ones with cameras and sensors taken out, not drivetrains. And those have a very wide ranging set of buyers who want those vehicles. So, I think there's a lot to our ASP growth over the years, which is secular. There certainly are cyclical factors. Five years ago, we used to talk about scrap metal prices, which are obviously less relevant today. Today, we're talking about used car prices, clearly relevant to us, but I think there are secular portions of this ASP growth, which will prove more durable. How exactly? I think is -- what is exactly attributable to either, I think is obviously a difficult intellectual exercise to isolate those variables. Ali Faghri : Okay, great. And I guess just as a follow-up, has the recent surge in pricing caused insurance companies to maybe change the way they think about the total loss formula, perhaps factoring in salvage pricing to a greater degree than what they've done historically, which should help increase total losses, maybe at a faster rate than in the past? Jeff Liaw : I'd say overall, we have seen total loss frequency increase during the pandemic, and as we anniversary the pandemic, we haven't seen a dramatic shift either. It is more a continuation of the many decade long trend, and I think you're well aware of it Ali, as well. If we were in 1980, a total loss frequency of 4%, today north of 20%, total loss frequency over 40 years has grown fivefold. I'd say over the course of the past year, we've seen a continuation of that trend, not a dramatic shift. The reason for that is that, of course, the used car price environment has been strong as well. And as you know, the higher the value of the intact car before the accident, the more prone the carriers are to repair it. So, we have had the offsetting effect of very strong salvage returns, which would otherwise all else equal drive more volume to total loss. We also had increase in used car values themselves, which all else equal would drive more cars to repair. The net effect of that, I think is a gradual continuation of the favorable trend we've seen for 40 years. Ali Faghri : Do all insurance companies factor in salvage returns into their total loss formula? Jeff Liaw : I think to varying degrees, some carriers will evaluate that economic proposition on every car. Others, meaning they will literally access our machine learning-enabled pricing tool, we call ProQuote, which estimates the value that an insurance carrier can achieve at auction. And some carriers will run a ProQuote for every perspective, total loss or literally every claim to see if it makes economic sense to total the car. Others will rely more on rules of thumb that the repair cost exceeds ex-percent of the intact value of the car and use those guideposts to make total loss decisions. Over time, more and more are accessing that specific economic decision, which I think leads to a better economic outcome for them. Ali Faghri : Great. Appreciate that color. And last one for me is, with nearly a billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, can you talk about your priorities for deploying that capital? I know investing in capacities is your priority, and you're still very much in investment mode for your earlier comments. But it does seem like you're going to have excess cash beyond that. So, I want to see how you think about maybe potential M&A and buybacks specifically, and how you balance those two? John North : Hey, Ali, it\u2019s John. I think obviously, the first priority is capacity investment, as you mentioned. As we've talked about and it has been the trend over the past number of years, all the way back to '16 with the 20/20/20 plan. That still remains a primary focus. There are obviously other markets in Western Europe, our expansion in Germany, Spain, and otherwise that are there as well. And then we've been opportunistic to return capital to shareholders at times in our past, and we think that makes sense. I think overall, we like the flexibility. We think that we've been able to take actions in the pandemic that wouldn't have otherwise been possible without [ph] the balance sheet that we had. And so, I think we view that as a structural advantage we want to maintain. And other than that, we're capitalists. So, we're certainly thinking about how to generate the highest return on capital overall, return on invested capital for our shareholders. Ali Faghri : Great. Thanks, Jeff and John for taking my questions. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the deployment of 360 technology. Just wanted to see where you stand in terms of the rollout of that technology. How prevalent do you think this will be across your inventory? And early but are you seeing any kind of measurable impact on selling prices because of the technology? Jeff Liaw : In a word, I think those are kind of the variables that are very hard to isolate Chris, in a very dynamic environment, right, in which there are a number of variables changing at the same time. For us, the technology including the one you described like 360, among other such technologies is important for us in terms of the service that we provide sellers. They have use cases for images like that. And so, we track that certainly very carefully to make sure we're providing them the best possible service. I don't think we're in a good position to talk about differential auction returns. I don't think there is a fundamental -- there's not a fundamental shift attributable to 360 images particularly. Chris Bottiglieri : That's interesting. And then two, can you talk more about the dealer consignment channel? Are you seeing increased engagement on the buy side of the equation, the sourcing at the buy side of the equation as inventories become more constrained in the industry? And is this how they are going to get a flywheel effect on your ability to source more vehicles from these same dealers? Jeff Liaw : I think in a word, yes, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure it's unique to the moment. By that I mean the dealers have grown as a share of our activity on both the sell side and buy side and defined more broadly to include not just U.S. and Canadian dealers, but dealers all around the world, right a dealer who buys a car and sells it as is or a dealer who buys it will recondition to some extent and then sell as is, that has been very much part of the flywheel effect over the past 10 years, 20 years plus. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it. Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask again around inflation just given it is now a larger part of the national conversation and given the quarter looks to have benefited from higher used car and metals prices, butprimarily I'd like to try to zero in if I can on the value of your land holdings. So, I've been seeing these headlines about how the average price of a home has risen by an incredible like 16.2% year-over-year in April and haven't really seen or done much research into what the price of, say, undeveloped land or land generally has done. But I've seen some other articles recently about big increases in the value of farmland, et cetera. So just wanted to get your sense of what might be happening with the value of your land. Given that you've been out there in the marketplace so much in recent years buying land, I would think that you have a good sense of the value of your existing properties, too? So what is happening with the value of the land? And, given that it doesn't get captured into the P&L, how are you thinking about or are you thinking about any actions to ensure that increased value gets reflected into the equity value of the company? I know you have historically preferred to be conservatively capitalized, but would you ever consider maybe like sale leasebacks to raise capital for shareholder friendly actions or any other kind of actions to try to tap into the value of that land or even just put some estimates out there for shareholders to see, so that they could better appreciate any increase in the value that you might have captured here? Jeff Liaw : Certainly, I appreciate the question and appreciate the thoughts. I think history would show that the shareholder-friendliest action we have taken is to buy the land and hold it forever, and we view that also as the customer friendliest approach as well, and that we own the land, we control it, we are the stewards of that facility, that capacity on behalf of the insurance industry for the next 50 years plus. So, that to me is overwhelmingly the default approach that we would take. As to your question, your IR question more narrowly about how to ensure that that value is reflected in our stock price. I think, to some extent that's academic for us. We own it, we use it, we have virtually never repurposed land that have been permitted for Copart use in part because it's so hard to achieve that. We don't repurpose it for other uses. We are there today and tomorrow to serve the insurance carriers and to serve our expanding non-insurance sellers as well. So, unfortunately, I think the intention, I know your question is good, but the outcome is effectively [ph] academic for us. That land is there to serve our customers. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. And then I would be curious if you have any thoughts on this emerging digital dealer to dealer marketplace that ACV Auctions and KAR Global's, TradeRev, and BacklotCars businesses operate. And is that a market that you might be interested in participating in? I was just thinking that, given that you're primarily a salvage car auction company and need to have I think capacity, including search [PH] capacity for cat type events, et cetera, if that might be a way to sort of participate more in the whole car market without crowding out space on your lots for salvaged cars? Jeff Liaw : We certainly evaluate and consider strategic extensions of the sort that you described a moment ago. So, I think we recognize that the world is evolving in terms of how vehicles transact. As we noted earlier on the call, we were the first to move rather dramatically in 2003, I think it was less conventionally obvious at the time to move to a pure digital auction platform. We did that 18 years ago. So as for additional shifts from here, we certainly evaluate, experiment, et cetera as to how we can achieve still greater share of the market over time. I would note that it is against the backdrop of companies of the sort you described who are running digital-only options, who are performing services on site of the dealer and so forth. It is against that backdrop that we continue to grow that dealer business at healthy double-digit rates for years now. So, I think that speaks to the power of auction liquidity as well. So, the one thing that -- with money, you can replicate an app and inspectors and so forth. With money, I'm not sure you can replicate auction liquidity and many thousands of bidders and buyers attending online auctions globally, but we will help you achieve the absolute highest and best use and value for your car whether it's here or Estonia or Honduras or Poland or wherever it might be. I think many of the other platforms out there cannot achieve the same. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Interesting, thank you. And then just last question, I wanted to ask about the types of things that you consider within your wheelhouse to auction. I know that you've obviously focused on salvage cars, but now also increasingly on whole cars and have gotten more into sort of the crash toys market, right with the personal watercraft and the motorcycles. I don't know if you're doing ATVs or just what other things you might potentially consider doing, heavier equipment, RVs I don't know. I was at one of your auction yards, it was 10-plus years ago, but you were auctioning then some like fire damaged or smoke damaged furniture or something like that. I don't know if that's ever anything that you would consider again, any sort of tangential moves, or you've got enough [indiscernible] in the air already? What do you think? Jeff Liaw : I think that's a long-term possibility, though I think that furniture is low on that priority list, but we have extended our auction technology and approach to other arenas. As you know, we acquired National Powersport Auctions, which is not per se in the salvage business, but sells motorcycles, watercraft, and other powersports equipment on behalf of financial institutions as well as dealers, and that we continue to expand that business as well. So, we do believe that our auction technology, our logistics management, our understanding of the regulatory environment, et cetera could well be applicable to other markets. We would experiment cautiously and thoughtfully because our core business is obviously critical to us in serving our existing customers, our existing markets as well as priority number one. But we would consider other such extensions as well. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your questions. Gary Prestopino : Hi, Jeff, John. Could I get what your global inventories were, up or down in the quarter, I didn't get a chance to write that down? Jeff Liaw : Global inventory at the end of April, at the end of the quarter was up 16% year-over-year. Gary Prestopino : 16% year-over-year. Okay. And then just a question on the dealer market. Over the years, how has the profile changed of the kind of car you're selling? My understanding of it is that initially it was -- the target market was the 10-year-old to 15-year-old car that the wholesaler was taking off the dealers\u2019 hands. Have you -- I guess downstream that to a younger kind of vehicle? Are you seeing a lot more of that now? And the real competitive advantage that you have is that auction liquidity that allows you to compete with some of these online platforms that are proliferating in the market? Jeff Liaw : Yes, in a word, yes. So, the cars have become younger so to speak, over time, in accordance with our insurance volume as well. So, the insurance industry used to total quote, old cars, badly damaged cars, and increasingly we're seeing lighter damaged and newer vehicles because of the severity and repair costs and sensors [indiscernible] that business which are well. As that market has shifted in that direction and therefore brought buyers to bear, so too then do more of the dealer cars become addressable as well. If you went back 20-years ago, I imagine a good portion of the dealer cars would have been actual wrecked cars that were for which the policyholder only had liability coverage, perhaps didn't have collision, didn't want to fund the money to repair the car himself or herself, ended up at a dealer, sold for cash and traded in for another car. Those might have been a meaningful portion of the cars that we were selling. Nowadays, however, I think it is now more like drivable whole cars, certainly newer than they were a decade ago. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Gary. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Healy : Thank you, guys. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture trend question. Jeff, when you look at kind of electrification, and think about how that's coming into the car population, how do you see electric vehicles compared to combustion engine vehicles in terms of stacking up in terms of total loss frequency? And are the proceeds of those vehicles materially different than what you see with kind of your historical book of business? Just kind of curious what the initial findings are there. Jeff Liaw : Sure. In short, the electric vehicles outperformed the average combustion engine vehicle at auction. The returns are meaningfully higher. I think the root cause of that, I think may well be that electric vehicles tend to be cars with a lot of sensors, a lot of technology on the perimeter, more exotic materials in the car to lower the weight and so forth. So, in many cases, they total more easily. But the returns we generated at auction are some of the highest that we achieved for any kinds of vehicles we sell. So, I think the total loss proposition is promising there. I think repairs are difficult, so severity tends to be high. Our repair infrastructure, the handful of public companies, as you know as well as the extensive mom and pop network around the U.S., the insurance carriers rely on U.S., UK, Canada, everywhere that insurance carriers rely on, in most cases are well equipped to manage repairs of combustion engine vehicles. Not yet so for electric cars, so if anything, I think that's a tailwind in our favor, and the severity will prove to be more extreme still for electric cars. John Healy : Great. And then just another theoretical question. With the non-insurance business becoming an even bigger part of the puzzle for you guys. As you look at that business, how do you react and how do you feel about potentially getting into aspects of the floor plan financing business? I think it's a polarizing business, but it's proven it has some pretty good returns to it. So, just kind of curious how you see that is and how you would rate that as an opportunity for the company going forward? Jeff Liaw : Sure, I think it's \u2013 the floorplan for financing certainly, broadly available, by and large for a given credit qualified dealer or buyer for a car. So, that's a space that we would consider, but carefully. So, it's obviously different in many respects from what we do day to day. And so, the banking business, not something that has to date been a priority for us to enter, but the kind of thing that's along with auctioning other models and so forth, it\u2019s in our strategic window but has not been a priority. John Healy : Great. Thank you, guys. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Liaw for closing remarks. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thanks, everyone for joining our call. We look forward to talking to you after the fourth quarter as well. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Thanks. Good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effects of certain discrete income tax items, acquisition-related integration charges, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, and uncertainties in our markets including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. So, now that we\u2019ve got the Safe Harbor language out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Liaw, our President. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021. We're pleased with the results for the year, another record setting quarter on multiple dimensions with a core to discussing some of the underlying factors in the business with you as well. The big news, of course, since we last spoke with you in May has been the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we've seen ongoing recovery across the industry including key measures, such as vehicle miles traveled, published by the Department of Transportation, gasoline consumption and the like. So we're beginning to see the return to normal driving activity accident volumes, et cetera, though, we noticed still likely down on an apples-to-apples basis versus two years ago. Given the growth in our business, nonetheless, our inventory levels we'll talk about in a bit are up meaningfully year-over-year, and up double digits versus July 2019 as well. And due to several drivers we'll discuss later on the call as well, our average selling prices, the values we generate for our customers remain elevated and are in fact at all-time highs. Before we dig in, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the Copart CAT team which has had an active and productive few weeks, certainly. As many have projected over the years, we're seeing more severe weather events with each passing year. And just recently, we've observed flooding and other severe weather in Germany, in Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and now of course, Hurricane Ida in the Northeastern United States. We're wishing all of those affected in those communities, including our employees, our own team members, the very best and a speedy recovery. Hundreds of us, myself included were in the northeast over the weekend and still more Copart team members headed there leading the charge from here forward. We'll discuss the financial implications of these recent weather events in future quarters, but the first order of business as always is to serve our customers and to take care of our own people. I wanted to start with a couple of statistics that we provide every quarter and close with a handful of remarks about the future as well. Our global unit sales for the quarter increased 25% year-over-year, with a U.S. increase of 26% and an international increase of 18.5% year-over-year. We continue to see more aggressive COVID-19 measures in many of our international markets than we have here in the U.S., which has caused more of a volume reduction or less volume growth in those markets. Within the U.S., our insurance business grew significantly year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of 2020. That is the net effect of lower driving activity, while increased driving activity year-over-year still slightly lower driving activity on a two year basis, but increasing claims frequency and increasing total loss frequency as well. Our non-insurance business which we talked about each quarter includes dealer consignments, wholesales and charities business, our Copart direct business in which we buy cars from consumers and institutional volume as well. We\u2019ve historically provided the unit growth in particular excluding wholesalers and charities, and on that basis our U.S. non-insurance business grew 17% year-over-year, including solid growth for our dealer consignment business, despite inventory shortages of course throughout the automotive industry. Our strong use of car prices are used vehicle prices are driving strong returns, and therefore consignment growth across these non-insurance categories. Our global inventory at the end of July increased 21.7% compared to a year ago, and double digit growth on a two year basis as well. That's comprised of a year-over-year increase in 28% for U.S. inventory, and a decline of 13% for international inventory attributable to the COVID-19 measures I've described a few moments ago. We are especially proud of the record average selling prices that we're delivering for our customers. The ASP strength is a reflection in part of course of market dynamics for used vehicles, but it's also a byproduct of our member recruitment and retention efforts. ASPs worldwide grew 20.7% for the quarter, with U.S. ASPs up 20.6%. The question we often get is, how much of that is attributable to mix a shift, and it's not. So our insurance ASPs are up comparable levels or even up more still than that. While growth in use car prices have of course contributed to our ASP growth. Our selling prices throughout the pandemic and prior to it as well had generally grown at a rate in excess of that of use car prices as well, that being a reflection of the marketing and member recruitment efforts I mentioned a moment ago. The Manheim index, which is one of those third-party indices we do track is at 194.5 for the month of August, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year. We track other indices as well, which would provide similar directional guidance. Our average selling prices are certainly the ultimate output metrics for auction liquidity. But the underlying figures that support that notion, the notion of the flywheel effect certainly continue as well. In the fourth quarter, we noted more bids per unit more domestic bids per unit, more international bids per unit, all compared to a year ago. Our auction liquidity is stronger than it has ever been. The natural questions, of course, will continue to be about what happens after the pandemic goes away. And we certainly hold an appropriate level of humility given the once in a lifetime nature of the event. And our comments will largely be U.S. centric. But I think it's worth revisiting some of these longer-term assumptions we've talked about on prior calls, and how they've been affected by the pandemic. Driving activity certainly is rebounding by the measures we have seen, gasoline consumption and vehicle miles traveled. But not yet back to 2019 levels. We continue to believe that longer-term mobility will continue to grow that miles per person in the U.S., but certainly in our emerging markets in many of the countries they're buying our highest value vehicles will grow significantly. We saw accidents and claims frequency decline somewhat during the pandemic, but it actually increased relative to miles driven. That is a new learning for us in the pandemic to see, I think the historical conventional wisdom has always been that if there are fewer vehicle miles traveled, that accident frequency per miles traveled will decrease. But in effects or in actual practice, we've seen arguably more distracted driving, certainly higher speed driving and therefore accident frequency can in some respects be inversely related to vehicle miles traveled, accident frequency per miles driven. On total loss frequency, the most important driver of our business long-term that we talked about at length in the past, we've seen that increase during the pandemic as well. And I wanted to offer one addendum to that in a moment. On the durability of ASPs, we note the longer-term trends in favor of ASPs. We continue to see increasing demand from emerging economies for the wrecked vehicles from the U.S., UK, Canada, other mature economies. These emerging economies are especially eager to purchase our vehicles, which are wrecked and total vehicles become their drivable fleet. That trend has been a 30, 40-year trend and we think will be so for the foreseeable future. I want to note one important consideration that I think can be easily overlooked. The natural questions are about when the selling prices could face weakness in light of an eventual recovery in semiconductors and new cars and the like. What I think is sometimes misunderstood is that all else equal, high ACVs or high pre accident values actually reduce total loss vacancy. The higher the more a car is worth before the accident all else equal the more prone it is to be repaired. And so eventually certainly there is a decline in ASPs or decline in in vehicle values, the offsetting consideration is that we will see higher total loss frequency and therefore higher consignment volume. We continue to make our operating and strategic decisions predicated on the expectation of long-term growth post-pandemics, consistent certainly with what we've communicated over the years. We're grateful for the strong financial performance of this quarter against the backdrop of a pandemic, and now severe weather events all over the world. It can feel awkward to sound a congratulatory tone on the call. But nonetheless, we're certainly pleased with our results in the fourth quarter excited about the year ahead. Our business is stronger than it has ever been. The quality of our team, the sophistication of our technology stacks and the depth of our auction liquidity, we think is yielding better results than ever for our customers. With that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John North. John North : Thanks, Jeff. I'll make a few comments on more of our operational results, and then we can open up to some questions. For the fourth quarter global revenue increased $223 million or 42%, including a $12 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $162.4 million or 36%, primarily due to higher average selling prices. U.S. service revenue grew 36% and international experienced an increase of 29%. Purchase vehicle sales increased $60.6 million or 89% with the higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchase vehicle revenue was up 99% over the prior year, and international group 73%. As a result of purchase vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales increased by $1.6 million overall. Global gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by $107.1 million or 43%. And our gross margin percentage increased by approximately 11 basis points to 48%. U.S. margins improved from 50% to 51%, driven primarily by higher ASPs. International margins decreased from 34% to 30%, due to a higher purchase vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs and cost leverage. I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense. G&A spend increased $5 million from $34.6 million a year ago to $39.7 million in 2021, but decreased from 6.6% of revenue to 5.3% revenue this year, an improvement of 130 basis points. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue in future years. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 47% from $205.7 million to $301.5 million. We delivered 114 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and leveraging volume. Net interest expense increased $0.2 million or 5% year-over-year, primarily due to our upsize revolving credit facility, which we upsized in July of last year. Before income tax expense was $43.1 million at a 14.4% effective tax rate, reflecting an $11 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which have been adjusted for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 17.6%, and our full year rate would have been a normalized 20.8%. Fourth quarter GAAP net income increased 55% from $165.5 million last year to $256 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency, acquisition related costs and the tax benefit on the exercise stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 51% from $163.4 million last year to $247.3 million in the fourth quarter of this year. For fiscal year \u201921, on a full year basis, global revenue increased $486.9 million or 22%, including a $31.6 million benefit due to currency. Global gross profit increased $335.3 million or 33%, and our gross margin percentage increased by 219 basis points to 50%. Operating income increased 39% to $320.3 million, and operating margin improved by 521 basis points. Finally GAAP net income increased 34% from $699.9 million last year and $936.5 million this year. And non-GAAP net income increased 45.7% from $610.5 million last year to $889.7 million this year. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights, as of July 31, 2021, we had $2.1 billion of liquidity comprised of over a billion dollars of cash and cash equivalents, and an undrawn revolving credit facility with a capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $570.5 million over July 31 of last year. Operating cash flow of the quarter decreased by $38.2 million year-over-year to $228.7 million, primarily driven by working capital investments as we increased the inventory levels, which Jeff spoke about a few moments ago. We invested $98.6 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, and approximately 76% of this amount was attributable capacity expansion. For the year, we invested $463 million in CapEx, of which approximately 85% was associated with capacity expansion. We continue to prioritize investing in physical infrastructure above other choices, and believe this continued investment is creating a durable advantage and our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole car marketplace. We continue our relentless focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology, while maintaining conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility, regardless of economic changes, or transitory market dynamics. Now we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks this morning. And we\u2019re happy to open it up for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Pleased proceed with your questions. Bob Labick : Good morning, and congratulations on fantastic results. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Bob. Thank you. Bob Labick : Yes. So I want to start, obviously, really, really strong sales growth. And you talked about inventory a little bit too, but kind of looking sequentially from last quarter to this quarter on the service revenue basis. Service revenues were roughly flat, but yard expenses were up sequentially, quite a bit. Is that all inventory build? And is that kind of -- is inventory seasonally building at this point? Are there other factors behind it? And if it's not inventory, what are the other drivers between the cyclical yard cost increase on flat revenues? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. Fair question, Bob. And that is certainly a healthy portion of the explanation is that the activity that comes from inventory growth. This is -- the fourth quarter is not historically an inventory build quarter for us. We tend to build in the second quarter, in particular ending in January through the winter, to some extent, the third. The fourth quarter is usually a quarter in which we are liberating inventory and preparing for the seasons ahead this year, in part because of the pandemic investment, in part because of growth in the business for the reasons we talked about a little while ago. Yes, that is a meaningful portion of the driver of yard costs. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, great. And I know you've touched on this, Jeff, but just maybe if you could kind of wrap it up in terms of the insurance growth is recovering. How you put us now versus the pre-pandemic levels, in terms of insurance activities? And how long do you think it takes to get back to a kind of a normalized rate of driving accident, accidents, et cetera looking ahead? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, that's the right question and almost an impossible one. My answer might be different, even in June, when the vaccines were rolling out, and I thought that we were on our way to being done with at all, and then the Delta variant emerged. And we've seen, of course, case counts rise again in many of certainly across the U.S. and in many of our other markets as well. So I think that the forecast is, I don't know that we would have a more insightful perspective about the unwinding of COVID-19 than others might. On driving activity, we look to the same metrics, you might, which is the DoT data, the gas consumption data. We have certainly information from our insurance company clients as well, which would suggest huge growth versus the fourth quarter of last year, but not yet back to fourth quarter of 2019 levels. When that bounces back, I don't -- candid answer is we don't know. I would guess multiple quarters though. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay, great. And then last one for me. Obviously, Copart -- dealer cars have been a big growth driver and you've been talking about it as such for quite some time. How does the type car like the ASP for your dealer cars compare now to maybe two or three years ago? Obviously, adjusting for the Manheim used car index. I guess in other words, are you still selling the same mix of cars you were before presumably aged inventory older cars et cetera? Or, have you expanded the mix and what is the typical Copart dealer car look like now? Jeff Liaw : I think the quotes typical car as you're describing looks somewhat similar though, higher ASP and off the cuff likely even adjusted for the Manheim index. The natural liquidity pool for us as you know from the insurance side of things becomes a better and less damaged and more valuable car over the years that's been true forever, as you know. That therefore has cultivated a different buyer base, different member base who's looking for a drivable car. And that in turn that liquidity has benefited us on the dealer side. That trend certainly continues. And I think if you've visited some of our yards, you'd be astonished by some of the high value Range Rovers and European vehicles that you would see on lots, that's at least on their surface look perfectly good and perfectly functional in many cases. So it is a gradual shift over time. This is not an overnight shift. But the liquidity certainly has nudged us up market, so to speak, and CD in our Copart dealer business as well. Bob Labick : Okay, super. Congratulations again. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Operator : The next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist. Please proceed with your questions. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch a little bit on the impact of the catastrophic events that have really swept the globe over the last couple of months. First, some of the pretty deadly flooding we saw across Europe, particularly in Germany, and any impact that had on the quarter or expectations for the coming quarter and that particular as well as what we should expect in the U.S.? And maybe you can remind us, I know there's been a lot of efforts to expand your catastrophic capabilities to make it so somewhat more profitable or profitable, given the situation. So any update you can provide generally would be helpful. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Sure. Thanks, Stephanie. The significant catastrophic activity largely occurred after the quarter. So in the United States, in particular, we did experience some flooding in the U.S. and in Germany prior compared to catastrophic events. In the past, these events were relatively modest in absolute size. In terms of catastrophic readiness, I think you posed the question, Stephanie, we have invested massively in this anticipating more severe weather over the years to come. In a catastrophe, the key questions are, do we have the technology to support the suddenly accelerated volume of activity. The answer is yes, and we are continuing to invest behind it. Do we have the land to store the vehicles until we can process the titles and sell them on behalf of our insurance company clients? The answer to that is yes, we have bought and built catastrophic yards that in many cases have run idle, simply awaiting a catastrophic event to service our customers again. We certainly depending on where the CAT event might be, also then lease land on a temporary basis as well to expand our capacity. And then towing and trucking is certainly an important variable as well. We pick up of course, millions of cars a year on behalf of our customers and have, again, a more acute need in the middle of a catastrophe. We have therefore invested in a fairly sizable fleet of our own, which we expect to continue to invest in as well to support those efforts. So these are folks day to day who are deployed in their home yards but in a crisis are asked to join us on the ground, where the need is most acute. So those are all ways for us to address to be more ready in anticipation of the weather events rather than scrambling last minute. Those have been investments that we've made very consistently and continue to grow year-after-year. Stephanie Moore : Got it. That's really helpful. And switching back to Germany, is this a situation where thinking of a little bit more longer-term, or maybe the impact of the kind of the flooding and where you guys were able to come in and really show your value from a consignment model standpoint? Is that an opportunity where it might accelerate this shift on what you're providing in Germany with insurance carriers and maybe potentially get them to shift over to more of what the model looks in the U.S. or any update there? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, I think that's an insightful question or insightful premise. And I think it is true that in Germany and elsewhere, the catastrophic events very much underscore the Copart value proposition that our service, our hustle in a moment of crisis is still more visible at moments like that to insurance carriers, whether they are longtime customers who have been with us for 30-years, or German insurance customers, we're recording for the first time or converting more of their volume to the consignment model under Copart\u2019s business model. That I think is certainly true. So all else equal this this for sure, it better communicates our value proposition to the German market. Stephanie Moore : Got it. I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Craig Kennison : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Copart likes to innovate without much fanfare, I think. But I'm curious if you would call out any key platform enhancements you might have made in the last six to 12-months that could be driving value for your buyers or sellers? Jeff Liaw : Craig, I think the introductory clause there I think is accurate. We tend not to declare much victory in particular on investor calls, where we launch these products to our sellers, our customers and our members as well. So I'll talk more broadly, I think we have introduced a range of products and enhanced them that help our customers to process titles more quickly. The loan payoff tool we talked about in the past is better still today than it was a year ago in terms of the lender coverage. Lien cars are an especially challenging title for insurance carriers to obtain, and therefore to allow us to sell the vehicle. And I think our various offerings loan payoff included in that realm are better than they ever have been. When it comes to the member side of things, we have deployed a number of different tools, including app based tools, including mobile check-ins and scheduling of pickups and such that has made their experience more seamless. And we think we are reducing friction for new and existing members to buy cars at Copart, and certainly have much to do on our to do list to move that ball forward. And then lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the auction itself is arguably our most important single platform that we invest in very aggressively to make the experience faster to make it still more mobile friendly to let anyone who wants to see and buy and track vehicles at Copart to make that as seamless experience as possible. Our paid member growth, paid member growth is up very meaningful year-over-year, a reflection of our investments in that arena. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then we continue to hear stories about the exceptionally high cost of shipping containers. And, naturally your business relies on that to some extent. Are you surprised that there's no or has seemingly no impact from the rising cost of shipping containers on your overall demand? I would think that your customers would have to factor that in. Jeff Liaw : I think that's a -- no effect, probably is overstating it. I think the point would be that the offsetting forces have overwhelmed that, so vehicle demand, the member recruitment and auction liquidity have more than covered it. I think it's also fair to say that when it comes to shipping containers and the inflationary pressures there, those are much heavier on inbound volume to the U.S. as has always been the case then it is the containers leaving or the ships leaving the U.S. and going elsewhere. I think those routes tend to be a little less congested, the slots less spoken for. So those pressures I think are more modest than they might appear at first glance. Craig Kennison : That's great. Hey, thank you so much. A - Jeff Liaw Thank you, Craig. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. A question on, I guess one of the vehicle profile. I think Jeff commented that that you're seeing less damage mix over time. Could you talk about sort of what percentage of mix might be run in drive and then the inverse of that what percentage of your mix is really sold as crushed car bodies on its metals content? And where you see that metals price environment now? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, to the last portion of your question, which is probably the easiest certainly metals, commodity metals are rebounding like many underlying physical goods in terms of the prices. Still, it's a small minority of our cars. They're sold for the pure meltdown value so to speak. And it's still smaller minority of our relevant economics where the car that sells for a few hundred dollars and is stripped of a part or two and then melted down is a very valuable service that we provide to our communities and our customers to eliminate those cars, but not as consequential when it comes to the economics of our business. Bret Jordan : And then the run and drive mix as a percentage I mean, obviously with dealer cars it's gone up. But is it a 30% or 40% of your volume sold or less than that? Jeff Liaw : No, we haven't disclosed that precise mix in the past and don't tend to do so. But in terms of the run and drive mix, yes it is a reflection of rising total loss frequency, so that less damaged cars. And I think it's probably easier Bret for that matter to strip the insurance from everything else to isolate that question. But when it comes to the insurance vehicles, yes, more cars are drivable today because a car can be totaled because a rear sensor or front sensor or lane departure warning sensor on the mirror is knocked out and the replacement and calibration is expensive. Yes, there are more run and drive cars as a percentage of the total. Bret Jordan : Okay. And a quick cash flow question, I guess when you think about the land build out strategy, I think it was back in \u201815 or \u201816. What inning of land acquisition are we in? And when you think about your CapEx expectations, what's the maintenance CapEx number versus the acquisition real estate investment CapEx expectation? John North : Rob? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is Joe [indiscernible] on for Daniel Imbro. [Technical Difficulty]. So our question, we're looking for availability on land overseas. I want to know if it's kind of an arduous process to find land? And given the [Technical Difficulty]. John North : Rob, can you hear us? Operator : Yes, I can hear you gentlemen, please continue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, yeah. Given the growth in Germany, and do you have the capacity to support more growth? Operator : Please, standby, we're experiencing technical difficulties. We'll resume momentarily [Operator Instructions]. Jeff Liaw : Okay. Thank you. Bret, apologies. We got disconnected there. Hello, Bret, can you hear us? Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Joe. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Joe. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. So I was looking for some color on the availability of land overseas. Wondering if it's an arduous process to find land. And then given the growth in Germany, do you have the capacity to support more growth there? Jeff Liaw : Great. Good question. And certainly the challenge of land acquisition and development is universal. It varies and it certainly varies by degrees, even here in the United States, depending on what city and state we're talking about. It then varies across countries as well and within those countries as well. So it\u2019s difficult to provide a thoughtful nuanced answer there. But yes, the challenges are similar. We do have the capacity in Germany to support the business we have and we have built for growth. But certainly we would expect to invest more over the years to come to support on our ongoing growth there. There is lead time to do so. So you've heard us tell the stories here in the U.S. in the past, in which we would buy a parcel of land in in California, for example that we've been pursuing for 20-years. We don't expect that to severely time in these markets. But it does take time to identify, to permit and to develop the land before we can operate on it. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then as a follow-up, what about Spain or other markets, you have capacity there? Jeff Liaw : Same answer. Yes, we have the capacity to serve the business today and for near, medium-term growth, but also that we intend to and will invest more still in it to support our future business there. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Exane. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys, a couple questions for me. First one is one of your salvage competitors spoke to inflation in towing cost? Have you seen this at all? Can you give us a sense for the sensitivity of yard ops to towing cost, and what type of impact this could have on operations growth? And then historically, when you've seen periods of inflationary towing cost, like what extent to be able to pass out there to sellers would be helpful. Jeff Liaw : Got it. Well, inflation, perhaps the generalized first, it's always a consideration in our business. And in different years, there are different inflationary inputs for our business. In many years, of course, it's been healthcare, fuel and other such commodities. Today, yes, somewhat more acute for all the reasons you're reading about in probably the press already. We're comfortable, we can manage that inflation and continue to deliver operating leverage in our business. So in short, towing costs are a significant portion of our costs at the yard level. So they certainly do matter to us. But we think it's manageable. And we haven't proactively raised it as a consideration this quarter, because it's just part of the business as is labor cost, healthcare costs, power and utilities, and so forth. It's part of what we do. Chris Bottiglieri : So it sounds like you do a lot of like logistics services for insurers, while managing the towing all of that. Is there an opportunity to the container side like or shipping side for ocean freight for your international buyers? Like who are the international buyers? They tend to be smaller, one-off consumers or small business like small businesses? Are there wholesalers that are managing this process for them? I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at, is there an advantage to use your scale to be able to get better shipping rates on behalf of your customers? Or there's not a way to arbitrage that market, just kind of curious how you think about that? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, I think there's a healthy distribution of buyers, some cases pure one-off buyers who will literally buy one car and then disappear. And there are others who make it their business by hundreds, in some cases thousands of vehicles to rebuild and sell in their native markets. We have experimented and dabbled certainly in international shipping over the years. If there is a healthy ecosystem that emerges, of course, around a business of our size, other folks who do ship, who do aggregate vehicles, who do martial them on behalf of buyers. So it's something we would continue to evaluate. But there's a robust enough and healthy enough ecosystem around us that has never been a barrier to auction participation. Chris Bottiglieri : Just quick housekeeping one. It looks me the small acquisition this quarter, $5 million or so like I\u2019m not sure it was proceeds for past acquisition or something. But anything you could shade color there'll be helpful. Jeff Liaw : Yeah, it\u2019s a small regional provider in our space that we've had a relationship with years and bought it in the Midwestern United States. Chris Bottiglieri : That's helpful. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Ryan Brinkman : Thank you for taking my questions. How much of the increase in transaction prices do you think is driven by the rise in used vehicle and crushed auto body prices, which would have of course or could of course cyclically decline after having experienced such a large run up, versus how much of the increase in transaction prices do you think is being driven by your member recruitment or other company's specific efforts, which could prove longer lasting? And then also, I think it's difficult to make such projections. But I'm just curious about the extent to which you think or estimate or handicap that increases in used vehicle in commodity prices that we've seen, may actually be partly structural in nature rather than cyclical, given fiscal or monetary policies, and that whatever level we do, cyclically declined to might, in fact, prove potentially higher than where we stood pre-pandemic. Jeff Liaw : Sure, I think you've got probably eight questions nested in there, but we'll try to tackle them. On the question of ASPs, and what is driving their growth, the third variable I'd add to your list in addition to I think, first you were citing the market dynamics and use vehicles today. Second, you're citing our member recruitment, retention, expansion and experience. The third variable I'd add to that list is total loss frequency that as carriers total more cars, as they fill newer and less damaged vehicles that has a healthy effect on ASPs as well. So the latter two, I would describe as durable long-term secular forces. The first I think, is an open question. I think all three have mattered a lot over the course of the past year. The first question on to what extent the vehicle values are typical or reflections of more secular structural forces, I think is a fair question. I don't know that we have an especially enlightened perspective on that. I think some of it for sure is here to stay, perhaps not all of it. How the semiconductor universe and the new vehicle, universe et cetera, how those forces unwind or how they rebound over the course of the next six to 24-months, I think is I don't know that we have a different perspective on that. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, very helpful color. Thanks. And then just last question is, what the latest is that you're seeing in terms of the recovery in miles driven? LKQ has made some comments recently about how well miles driven is recovering. The distribution of when people are driving throughout the day is different, less centered around commuting hours, meaning less congestion, which can result in accent frequency and maybe not recovering in a linear fashion along with miles driven. Just curious what the latest that you're seeing there might be? Jeff Liaw : Latest data, June, July, August, which suggests ongoing recovery. And certainly now is the Northeast goes back to school, also post-Labor Day we're seeing a recovery. But not yet back to 2019 levels. I don't know that we have a finer resolution on that question than you would, we're looking at the same underlying data. As for the distribution of driving hours, I think we've seen a change both in when people drive and where they drive to. So less commuting much more retail, much more recreation, I think in some cases, as folks have avoided airlines and such. Now that has frankly yielded in the end higher accident frequencies and that I think had been predicted going into the pandemic. If you told folks that vehicle miles traveled would go down by ex-percent, I think the conventional wisdom is that accidents, the number of accidents in the absolute would go down by more than ex-percent. And in fact, it has gone down by significantly less than ex-percent, a reflection of higher speed driving, more distracted driving, and the like. So, even though the congestion I think has been appreciably less than it once was, I think that has not yet yielded the effect you just described. Ryan Brinkman : Very interesting. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Bret Jordan : Hey, guys. I think my follow-up question got lost in the shuffle earlier. It was cash flow. When you think about your CapEx in the last five or six years of real estate investment, what inning are we at in building out the North American real estate? And, as you think about your CapEx number, what number will remain versus acquisition of additional real estate going forward? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, fair question, Bret. I think we launched you may remember Jay talking about it in the spring of 2016, or then 20, 2020 program to expand our footprint to absorb the growth that was to come. If anything, we had then under declared our ambitions by a fair bit, and have continued to invest even through this past quarter, as you've seen. The issue with the forward prognosis is that this is a dynamic question. It's a reflection of what we see in volume growth, share gain, growth of our non-insurance business, cycle times, et cetera. But we are certainly continuing to meet literally weekly to review our investment opportunities in land and the like, both in the U.S. and overseas. So my expectation is that we'll continue to invest in land. It each quarter, as you know, tends to be very lumpy, because the nature of land is that we chase it for a long time, and it finally comes through and therefore one quarter suddenly, much more substantial than the prior one. But we can continue to invest in our business, it's essential to what we do. So we expect that to continue. Bret Jordan : Okay. Could you give us sort of an expectation on maintenance CapEx, so we can sort of bucket what is acquisition versus ongoing spend? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, maintenance CapEx, I think as a proxy depreciation and amortization is a decent starting point. It's a reflection of the useful lives logic that we are diligent about and review with our accountants and so forth, that that should reflect how long that asset should last. And it's a good proxy certainly across the company overall. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist. Please proceed with your questions. Stephanie Moore : Hi, thank you for the follow-up. I just had a quick point. I think you touched on many times just the efforts that have been done on a member recruitment side on the buyer side. So maybe you can touch a little bit on is there is there anything different that has been done as the strategy needed to change, or just remind us what you're doing specifically just to reach that larger buyer base? Has anything changed to create maybe a more stable buyer base where you have more consistent purchases? Just anything there would be helpful. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Excellent. I appreciate the questions, Stephanie. And the logic is a little bit circular, but it is the growth, the quality of our cars, the vehicles that we earn the right to sell from dealers then brings additional members on board. The increasing total loss frequency brings more members on board. The increasing members who are on board then brings more consignments from dealers and insurance companies. So it certainly is circulars that very much works in both directions. In terms of the actual active measures we take on member recruitment, it very much varies by country, by market, by type of buyer. It can include things as mundane is the trade show attendance, physical media, certainly social media, and the like. But it's radio ads, et cetera. It's all over the map and we tried to have a sophisticated market specific approach to each of our major member buying countries. It's also a major to do of ours to anticipate the next country which has the characteristics of one that should be a major Copart buyer, and to invest proactively in that. And then once they're in the funnel, we view the member experience is paramount as well, not just the registration and becoming eligible to bid and participate at Copart auctions, but really the lifetime journey with Copart, what it means to buy a car, pay for it, pick it up, and so on and so forth. And there are certainly enhancements we'll provide there over the years to come as well. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Ali Faghri with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your questions. Ali Faghri : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering about the impact of these CAT events on your margins. In the past, you talked about upfront costs related to towing and land. And you've seen kind of a pretty sizable margin impact initially before you actually sell those incremental total loss vehicles. Given all of the investments you've made in land, as well as your fleet on the towing side as well, is there a chance that these CAT events have maybe less of a kind of near-term cost and margin impact than they have historically? Jeff Liaw : I think it's perhaps more accurate Ali, to say that for the same catastrophic event relative to 10-years ago, the financial effect impact to us is more muted than it otherwise would have been. Now, every catastrophic event is unique. And the East Coast is very different from Louisiana, which is in turn very different from Houston, Texas, which is certainly in turn different in Germany as well. So it's a matter of investing proactively. It's partially a question of cost, because it allows us to clip the extremes of the supply curve, but largely about service too. The reason we own trucks and land and have a catastrophic team already assigned here at Copart, who is ready to deploy at a moment's notice, that as much about customer service as it is about cost. But yes, all else equal, the margin effects would be more muted today than they otherwise would have been. But the priority really is providing excellent service to our customers. Ali Faghri : Great. That makes sense. Appreciate the color. And then a quick follow-up, what drove the stronger vehicle sales growth in the quarter? Is there anything you'd call out there? Jeff Liaw : The vehicle sales growth, there are a number of different avenues through which Copart purchases cars, including our Copart direct business, which reflects vehicles we buy directly from consumers and in turn sell at our auction platform. It certainly includes our international business. In Germany, as we penetrate the market and show the market why the consignment model with Copart makes the most sense, we also hope to get the flywheel going by purchasing cars there as well. So there are a number of different forces. I think, unfortunately, the vehicle sales number just has an awkwardly outsized effect on the P&L results, especially if you're focused on basis point changes and margin rates and the like. But certainly, we continue to evaluate the business on a per vehicle economics basis, which is a little bit less transparent to the outside world. But yes, vehicle sales have grown, but even still relative to the actual size of our business very modest. Meaning, if we were to gross up every car we sold to its actual selling price, you will see that the purchase of vehicles is pretty modest in the grand scheme of things. Ali Faghri : Got it. And one final question, if I can squeeze it in. I\u2019m sure you do a lot of work on this internally, but any insights about what your market share currently may be within kind of the insurance business, the consignment side versus your primary competitor? I know this industry has historically been viewed as a duopoly, but it's pretty clear that Copart has taken share over the last call it five plus years. So I'm curious if you have any kind of numbers that you would put around your market share versus your main competitor. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : No, appreciate the question. I don't think we could provide an absolute number or an estimate of our market share. We certainly do know that our customers have alternatives and we act that way and invest and operate that way as well. Our market share gains which you just described a moment ago, a reflection of some of the things we talked about on the call, including catastrophic readiness, including auction liquidity and day to day service, including the technology stack or member experience, et cetera. So over the years, we certainly have grown our market position, because we take it. That's one of our key aspirations as a business, and we hope to do so in the future as well, but not in a position to provide an absolute estimate. Ali Faghri : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, John. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Ali. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Jeff Liaw : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us for the fourth quarter. We'll talk to you in a couple of months after the first quarter of fiscal \u201822. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Good morning. During today's call we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse payroll tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our investor relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures together with our corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, and uncertainties in our markets including the COVID-19 pandemic.  Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31st, 2021 and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to our President and CEO North America, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We are pleased to report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against a backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and evolving pandemic, changing global traffic patterns, supply chain disruptions, a strong used car price environment, and an active storm season to name a few.  We continue to serve our customers successfully to enhance auction liquidity and to continue our long-term trend of profitable growth. I'll elaborate on a handful of key themes for the quarter and John will provide additional perspective. My comments will center around Hurricane Ida, brief commentary there, secondly, the health of our auctions, and third the implications of the used car price environment, and fourth, our institutional commitment to sustainability.  First, on Hurricane Ida; Hurricane Ida struck the Gulf States on August 29th and the north -east region on September 1st and 2nd. This represents our most substantial storm since Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and our largest storm in the north-east region since Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  Having learned from those experiences and a litany of catastrophic events between then and now, we were better prepared for this event than any in our history, due to our very substantial investment over the years in land, in technology, in Company-owned trucks, Company-employed drivers, heavy equipment, and most importantly, our dedicated tag team who deployed at a moment's notice. Hundreds of us from around the country spent our Labor Day weekend on the ground and many weeks thereafter, managing the retrieval of vehicles, receiving an imaging them, and navigating the vehicles through the titling process to their eventual sale. As is often the case with major storms, we experienced an operating loss from the event in the quarter of a few million dollars.  We view our pre -storm prep and our robust response to catastrophic events as investments in the strong and durable partnerships we have with our insurance sellers. Our storm-related costs, as you know from prior experiences, include lease expense for temporary storage facilities, premiums for towing, labor costs and overtime for our people, travel expenses and lodging, among others.  These expenses are of course offset by revenue from incremental unit volume. Financially speaking, the impact of the storm in the quarter was approximately 100 to 150 basis points of gross and operating margin rate compression. You all know we haven't provided further specifics in our press release or included adjustments in our non-GAAP earnings schedule for the catastrophe.  We believe that providing excellent service in difficult times is an intrinsic aspect of our value proposition to our customers and that these storms will become -- will increase in frequency and severity over time. The second thing I wanted to tackle is our unit volume growth and our auction liquidity. We experienced global unit sales increase of 21% year-over-year, of which approximately 2 points was explained by the hurricane itself. A U.S. increase of almost 24% and again, 2 or 3 points of that growth was explained by Hurricane Ida. We grew our international unit sales by just shy of 8%. The COVID responses in countries outside the U.S., as a general matter, continue to be more aggressive and more pronounced than what we've experienced here at stay side. Our insurance business grew, relative to the first quarter of last year, at 23%. We are observing certain continued increases in total loss frequency. I'll comment more about that in a moment and benefit from share gain as well. Driving activity itself continues to rebound relative to last year very significantly, but still just shy on measures such as gasoline consumption of what we experienced in the year prior.  Total loss frequency has increased steadily, including during the pandemic. The , as many folks on the phone already know, the strong used car price environment almost certainly is an inhibitor to assignment volume  to Copart auctions. Turning to our non-insurance volume.  When we exclude lower-value cars, such as wholesalers and charities, our non-insurance business grew 7.5% year-over-year with our dealer unit volume up slightly approximately 1% versus last year and strong growth in our Copart direct business. I'll note and you'll note, that this represents solid, absolute performance, but arguably the strongest relative performance in our history to other vehicle marketplaces given what is the pronounced shortage of available supply in the industry.  We think this is a testament to the power of Copart's marketplace. And we said it before, but it's worth reiterating. The cars we earn the right to sell on behalf of insurance companies along with rising total loss frequency, enable us to achieve superior returns for progressively more non-insurance cars as well. And it's also true in reverse.  The dealer rental car fleet, bank, and consumer cars we earn the right to sell, drive still more insurance volume and higher total loss frequency as the years go by. The next theme I wanted to address is prices themselves. We are experiencing, of course, high used vehicle prices across the world and certainly strong ASPs at Copart auctions as well. Our ASPs worldwide grew 11% for the year -- year-over-year for the quarter, with U.S. ASPs up 10% year-over-year as well. The Manheim Index, as one industry proxy, is at all-time highs with a November mid-month reading of 234.8. The durability of ASPs is, of course, a natural question.  There certainly are longer-term trends in favor of higher ASPs, including our auction liquidity, total loss frequency, and the like, as well as growing demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our origin countries. We also continue to invest significant resources in member recruitment registration, retention, and the like. But, of course, we should acknowledge the technical forces as well.  There remains a chip shortage which is affecting the production of new vehicles and driving higher prices for used vehicles around the world. Our perspective doesn't diverge from the industry consensus which indicates that this chip shortage will persist well into 2022 and likely into 2023 as well.  The important note here is that if and when used car prices do fall, we expect a corresponding increase in assignment volumes. Total loss frequency is negatively correlated with used car prices. The more a car is worth before the accident, the more prone it is to being repaired. Last theme I wanted to tackle before handing it to John is, the notion of sustainability.  As a longstanding cultural matter, we at Copart have always asked to be judged on our actions and results, not our words or our PowerPoint presentations, but we recognize that we're at a moment in history in which companies are being challenged to articulate their ESG position more clearly and I'll spend a few minutes on that theme.  Copart plays a critical role in the automotive circular economy, enabling the reuse, recycling, and responsible disposal of vehicles around the world. We sell well over 3 million vehicles per year. And by matching those vehicles with our optimal owners, we enable the return to service of automobiles that would otherwise have been scrapped, the re-use of parts that otherwise would have ended up in landfills.  As a result, the re-use and recycling that Copart enables displaces what otherwise would have been de novo resource extraction and energy consuming manufacturing as well. As climate events themselves increase in frequency and severity, Copart will play a growing role in assisting communities and recovering from them as we have in our past by removing vehicles from roadways and storage facilities and repair shops enabling the free flow of people and goods and services and economies in which we do business.  And finally, because so many of our vehicles are ultimately purchased by buyers outside the U.S., our auctions contribute to the physical and economic mobility of residents in countries of emerging economies, including in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. If you haven't read it already, please do see our annual shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website where we expound further on these themes among others, including diversity and inclusion. We'll offer more substance in the coming days in the form of a sustainability report as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to talk about the fourth quarter's financial results -- the first quarter's financial results. John North : Thanks, Jeff. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to begin by also acknowledging our team's effort relative to Hurricane Ida and thank them for their dedication and sacrifice. Being relatively new to the Copart family, this is my first opportunity to see us in action and to observe firsthand a tremendous sense of ownership we take to ensure positive outcome, in the face of both disaster and tragedy.  Our people and our culture have always been and will continue to be the key to our success. Now I'll make a few comments on our operational results and then we'll open it up for questions. For the first quarter, total revenue increased $217 million or 37%, including a nearly $4 million benefit due to currency.  Global service revenue increased to $152 million or 30% primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue was up 31% and international experienced an increase of 18%. Purchase vehicles sales increased $65 million or 84% due to higher ASPs and increased volume. U.S. purchase nickel revenue was up 87% over the prior year and international grew 79%. As a result, purchase vehicle gross profit is defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $2.7 million overall. As Jeff mentioned, we had significant relative growth in our purchase vehicle volume, resulting in gross and operating margin rate contraction of approximately a 150 basis points to 200 basis points. Global gross profit in the first quarter increased by $88 million or 30%.  And our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 250 basis points to 47.5%. U.S. margins declined from 52.6 to 50.3 and international margins decreased from 37 to 33.1 due to a higher purchase vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs globally. I will now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense.  G&A spend increased $5.9 million from $35.2 million a year ago to $41.1 million in 2022, yet it's lower from 5.9% of revenue to 5.1% of revenue this year. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 33% from $248.6 million to $330.1 million. First quarter income tax expense was $65.5 million, had a 20.1% effective tax rate, which reflected a $3 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options. Adjusting those to a non-GAAP measure, included in our earnings release, and changed our effective tax rate to 21%.  First quarter GAAP Net Income increased from 30% from $200 million last year to $260 million this year adjusted to remove the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options. Non-GAAP Net Income increased 37% from $188.5 million last year to $257.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our global inventory at the end of October increased 12% from last year. This is comprised of a year-over-year increase of 14% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 3% for international inventory. These increases in inventory is largely a function of U.S. accident frequency and miles driven returning to normal, supplemented with the effects of Ida and share gains, partially offset by declines in international driven by countries with longer duration lock downs in response to COVID.  Now, to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.3 billion of liquidity comprising of $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $54 million year-over-year to $312.5 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $65 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Approximately 70% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. We are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure, above other choices, and believe this continued investment is helping to create durable advantages and our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole car marketplace. We're continuing to focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics. And with that we're happy to open up the call for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Stephanie Moore with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch a bit on the overall inflationary and cost environment that you're currently experiencing, and if you are in fact taking the impact of the hurricane out of the equation and thanks for quantifying the impact that you saw from that event.  But just looking at, 1, the dynamic that you called about on the last quarter was just operating deleverages inventory, the levels increase as well as somewhat newer dynamics that we've heard, whether it's higher towing costs, higher driving costs, you name it. So just want to walk through if you could what you're seeing from an inflationary standpoint and higher costs and then some levers that you might have in place to offset from those costs would be helpful. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Sure. In the cost categories you noticed, Stephanie, certainly, I think all participants in all economies worldwide are experiencing inflation, to some extent in the form of wages, towing expense, fuel, capital equipment, and the like. And certainly, we aren't immune to that either.  It's our job to manage that, to absorb it where necessary, to manage with productivity as we can, and to deliver the results. So it's -- we are seeing and experiencing those things. I would note that inflation, although certainly more pronounced today, it's not a brand new phenomenon.  For years, we've experienced very meaningful inflation in healthcare costs, for example, land has continued to grow in value, capital equipment, the loaders we buy, for example, are more expensive than they were 5 years or 10 years ago as well. So inflation is more pronounced today, but it's not a radically new phenomenon. So we do have experience in managing through that, with productivity being the most important long-term lever. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then I guess maybe just talk a little bit about from an inventory standpoint. Do you find that given where inventory levels are particularly in the U.S., that you're seeing just as inventory builds just some operating leverage in the near-term as well as maybe some seasonality. Just trying to think through the dynamic that impacted the fourth quarter and if that continued into the first. Jeff Liaw : Fair question and it's -- as you know Stephanie, we tend -- we run the business to deliver service per se trying to optimize any individual quarter months or units in our inventory. I think your observation about inventory growth and unit volume growth helping to absorb fixed or semi fixed costs is real.  There's also other noise in the system as you know from the inflation you just mentioned a moment ago, Hurricane Ida among other things. But yes, all else equal certainly unit volume growth on its own is near medium-term accretive to margins. Stephanie Moore : Absolutely. Thank you. And then lastly for me, big picture, you put out a release in early November about a partnership with, I believe, Commerce Bank that just talked about some of the digital efforts that you have in place, rare. I feel like most of the time you don't advertise some of the investments and initiatives you have in place.  But maybe if you could talk about incremental investments that you're looking going forward, is it focused on improving cycle times, or what are areas where you find have the largest opportunities for improvement here just for continued investments? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Fair point. And Stephanie I'll talk perhaps in broader framework here. It's our job to serve our clients and, as you know, multiple types of clients starting with insurance companies, which still represent the strong majority of the units we sell. For them, they care a lot about speed and execution. They care about auction returns, they care about policyholder experience. And on all dimensions, we are investing.  There are different nuances to each, I think what you mentioned a moment ago about cycle times and the public notice you mentioned a moment ago about our partnership with Commerce Bank, for example, those are investments to address cycle times in particular for cars with outstanding liens on them, which also have derivative effects on the policyholder settlement timelines in some cases. So we certainly are investing there. Lien holder cars are in particular some of the most challenging vehicles in terms of cycle times and we invest all the time in initiatives like that. But anyway, the point of all that was there are many dimensions to that and we invest across those dimensions as well. Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bob Labick : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Bob Bob Labick : I wanted to start and dig a little further on the total loss frequency commentary you offered us in the prepared remarks and as it relates to used car prices and insurance carriers ' formulas to total a car. If you had said two years ago, used car prices would rise 40% now 60% or 70% over a two-year period, I would have incorrectly said total loss frequency would crater unless repair costs went up equally to offset it.  So I guess my question is, are repair costs up as much in terms of dollars as used car prices? I can't imagine that's true. Or are insurers adjusting their total loss calculation real time to the current salvage your recovery rates that you're getting, or is it something else?  Because if it's dynamic insurance calculations, if they're changing it with used car prices much faster than they have in the past, would that potentially suggest that as used car prices fall then total loss frequency wouldn't rise as fast as anticipated? If that question makes sense. Jeff Liaw : It does. A very perceptive question, Bob, as usual. I think your statement is accurate and the total loss frequency I think has been impaired, all else equal, because of our used car prices. And your question as to then what tips balance -- -- what tips to balance in the other direction? I think it is a combination of repair costs as well as rental car costs.  The repair pack, so to speak, for an insurance carrier is also onerous and expensive -- is onerous and expensive today, relative to what it was 2 years ago. I think there's also just the long-term secular trends in this direction. Anyway, Bob, as you know, which is the accident section and avoidance systems and the vehicle complexity, substrate mix change from steel to aluminum and carbon and the like, electric vehicles, etc.  I think those are all contributing to the net effect that total loss frequency is rising when this one variable in isolation would suggest that it shouldn't. Now, the other variable which is worth mentioning, Bob, is the it's the mix between the -- it's the tinge between the two as well in terms of what the used car prices are, but also our auction returns. Our auction returns are up I think more than pre -accident vehicle prices have been over that same period. So we have also helped to close that gap with the auction results as well. Bob Labick : Got it. Okay. That's great. Very helpful. And just kind of going back to cycle time. When I think in general, that's obviously a benefit in period entry, but you're always trying to improve cycle times. And obviously, they've probably have over the last 5, 10 years as well. And as cycle times do improve a little bit, they open up yard capacity.  So just curious as to when -- thinking about your over-capitalized balance sheet and the liquidity that you have, what are the primary uses of that liquidity as you run out of more land to buy or if cycle times pick up enough, you need less land at the same time. So just trying to balance those two. And ask other uses of capital beyond land because eventually you won't have to always buy land. Jeff Liaw : Many puts and takes on the question of land. So the business is growing, and has been growing for years. That by itself would necessitate more land not less. Cycle times have improved, but there's plenty of complexity in the ecosystem as well. So there are many examples, case studies, in which cycle times are increasing.  And today, arguably, the very strong used car prices are making lean settlements faster than they otherwise would be, relative to an environment in which you had a bunch of underwater loans, for example, Bob, as you know. And so I think in practice we will continue to invest in line for years to come, and probably very substantially.  That said, as you noted, overcapitalized, Bob, is more editorializing perhaps than I offer, but nonetheless I think the point there we have a very robust balance sheet today but the answer over the next 10 years is sure that we'll buy stock back as we always have from our share count ex the split that we have contracted the open market show party the shares outstanding over the years and we'll continue to do so. That's a matter of timing and comparison to our relative investment options and land and otherwise. So we'll be good stewards of capital and return that via share buybacks at some point. Bob Labick : Okay. Super. And I meant to say well capitalized, but it slipped out as over-capitalized. I apologize. And thanks for answering. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Some have already been asked, but I thought I'd shift to Europe. I think you mentioned 8% volume growth, which was slower than what you saw in the U.S. And I think you identified COVID and the response there as a factor.  But it's also a smaller business with potentially a lot of momentum to it. Could you just comment on maybe the secular shift in that business and whether you still feel like you have momentum with insurance carriers in shifting their priorities to -- the shifting their practices to your platform. Jeff Liaw : Sure. And one technical clarification; when we said the growth rate, that was for our \"international business \" which includes Canada, Brazil, the UK, Finland, Spain, Germany, and the Middle East, so it's not just Europe alone. I think underlying your question, Craig, is what's happening in Spain and Germany and our growth markets in Europe, for example.  And there we've continued to experience very significant year-over-year growth. We continue to prove the economic model, if anything, the gap between the auction returns we generate at Copart auctions relative to the listing services we've talked about in the past, that gap is expanding still. The economic proposition, I think, is becoming more compelling, not less. But what you're seeing in terms of the overall growth rate is for sure that the UK and Canada for that matter, and Brazil in certain areas have been more aggressive about COVID-19 countermeasures than the U.S. has. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And then you had good success in the U.S. with your non-insurance business. Is there a point when your international businesses mature such that you feel comfortable rolling out a service like that as well? Jeff Liaw : Which service now, Craig? Craig Kennison : I'm talking about non-insurance volumes, especially dealers selling cars on your platform. Jeff Liaw : Yes, in some that we have. Where we do have liquid auction marketplaces we do -- we have pursued other sources of that volume, including dealers and otherwise. In Canada, in Brazil and the UK,  Middle East. In most places we do business as liquidity is -- comes in a hurry and the cars that we can sell that extend beyond total loss units from insurance carriers happen pretty quickly as well. Craig Kennison : And then lastly, I appreciate your commentary on sustainability. Clearly your story fits that narrative quite well and nice to hear you articulate it. I'm wondering if the board or you have done any analysis on whether you are under owned by that group of investors that put ESG as there are number 1 priority. Jeff Liaw : A judgment call perhaps to make from where we sit. I'm not sitting in their rooms and understand their criteria. But certainly from our understanding of what constitutes true sustainability, I think our businesses should be at the very top of that list. I think that's a reasonable conclusion, Craig, but we don't spend a lot of energy with target list and trying to figure out who should own us and not. We trust this. We deliver the results long term economically and sustainability wise. And those questions will take care of themselves. Craig Kennison : That's great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff, I want to start on the non-insurance side of the business. You noted some pretty stark outperformance versus the peers. As you're growing into the diverse synergies back to the business, I have a few questions. One: right now, are you selling all of those dealer cars internationally, or are you actually transacting some maybe U.S. dealer-sourced cars to other dealers in the U.S.?  And the second question would be, given the reverse synergies and, obviously, the attractive unit economics, what are the limiting factors on maybe growing into that faster as you think about the next 3 years to 5 years outlook on units\u2019 side? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Daniel, to your first question, the latter. So the U.S. dealer cars are being sold both to U.S. buyers and international buyers. Both are meaningful portions of the U.S. dealer buyer base. On your second question about the limit, that's -- there are dynamic circumstances. So as total loss frequency rises, as we win more dealer cars, we then can win more dealer cars.  So the logic is a little bit circular. But are we the absolute sweet spot for a perfectly intact $75,000 Audi today when it comes to liquidity? Perhaps not yes. I'd argue we can achieve a very strong result there too, but there are certainly many cars and an increasing number of cars for which we are the obvious answer. I don't think we're yet the obvious answer for $75,000 Audis, but there's no ceiling per se. probably the same conceptually, Daniel, when folks ask what the ceiling for total loss frequency is? Can it get to 25%? Can it get to 30%? I think this is a dynamic picture and we will see that evolution over time, but there's no reason there's a hard asymptote. Daniel Imbro : That makes sense. And, I guess, tied to Bob's question earlier, as you think about land capacity though, you're not feeling right now, given a tradeoff, like you don't have enough land for continued growth in either dealer or insurance cars? Your land gives you flexibility to pursue both? Jeff Liaw : Correct. The combination of our land and our logistics and our planning is such that we are in position to serve our customers. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. And then last question, I just wanted to touch on the percentage of vehicles, I think it was 10,000 less that was filed, that were getting sold overseas. I think we're still in the mid-30s. That's pretty flat from the year before. I guess where we are is a hard question to answer, but in terms of innings, where are we at in terms of opening up new countries that sell into?  Are there still larger emerging markets, thinking like India, that you guys aren't selling into today? And maybe can you talk about what the steps look like as you enter into these new countries to really start scaling those buyer basis where you're not maybe fully matured today? Jeff Liaw : I think it's not anywhere close to mature. I think if you compare, and we do this exercise internally some years ago, but if you compare long-term GDP growth rates and have that on one axis, on the other axis have vehicles per capita, the very fastest-growing economies in the world tend to be the ones with the fewest cars and vice versa The ones with the slowest growing economies have the most cars, let's say, U.S., Western Europe, Japan, for example.  And so there will be a 50 year trend of more of our used wrecked damaged vehicles moving overseas where they are meaningful contributors to economic and fiscal mobility there. That theme isn't going away anytime soon. As for tactically how we pursue individual countries, we do both.  So we are responsive when we see activity from countries that previously didn't buy and we'll invest in online and physical marketing in some cases, we will invest in fiscal resources on the ground there as well to cultivate that new buyer base. And in some cases, we're simply proactively identifying countries that fit the parameters. If, obviously, country X looks a whole lot like countries Y and Z that already buy a lot, let's go dip our toe there proactively even before we see actual buyer activity. So we give you both. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much and best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just one quick clerical one to start off with. With the revenue impact on the cat, was that roughly like 2% as well in terms of the contribution to revenue that you gave volumes? Jeff Liaw : Yes. Directionally, yes. Chris Bottiglieri : That's okay. And then I want to ask about what you're seeing in terms of towing availability, what extent that may become a constraint as more brick-and-mortar dealers are going digital and online retailers if that's putting pressure on the business? And then relatedly you have a small but growing fleet in the U.S. that's dedicated for CAT events. But what do you do with those towing vehicles when you're not in a car?  The other 365 days of the year, how do you use those towing trucks in other parts of the year and is there any opportunity to expand that to vertically integrate or is it just an upscale? How do you think about that trade-off? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. We've not deployed based support our business in markets in which we are facing the most pressure in terms of towing vehicles. So you're right that even when there are not active storms, we make good use those assets. Medium, long-term, I think there is -- there may well be an opportunity to invest further still here.  Historically we have done very well with the third-party contractor model. They tend to be very resourceful and productive. And it's a good alignment of interest as they want to grow and support their own businesses and to work productively for us. But that's all we're going to -- it's an evolving mix and one we continue to evaluate overtime. During the catastrophic event, and certainly even -- and afterwards as well, we are certainly happy that we have those trucks and those drivers employed in-house. They have been very productive members of our team. Chris Bottiglieri : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeff Liaw : Morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the Ida cars, and I think you called out the 14% U.S. inventory growth, have most of Ida cars been processed or are there any that flow into the second quarter that might come with margins but fewer expenses associated with them? Jeff Liaw : Many of those cars are -- we have not yet sold the majority of the cars. So they're coming in -- many of them in the second quarter, and some no doubt will -- there be a tail that takes longer still than that. Bret Jordan : And then you did comment that insurance growth of 23% included both a higher total loss rate as well as share. Could you maybe give us some what the share versus total loss in that growth? Jeff Liaw : No, we don't break that out. And, Bret, the share commentary, I think, as you know, is along that comment product find in literally every earnings call. It's been true for a long time, the industry tends to move more slowly in terms of switching providers, but over the very long haul, we have generally speaking grown our share both in the insurance realm and certainly in the non-insurance as well. And that was true in this quarter as it was in the past 30 quarters as well. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess a question for the longer-term, as you think about the purchase vehicle trend and purchase vehicles up 85%, if you were to think out 3 years to 5 years, do you see this becoming a business where you are doing a greater percentage of your unit volume on purchased versus service? Jeff Liaw : No, I think the long-term wins of history would suggest we move the other way that we migrate eventually from principal to a consignment basis. The principal business, for example in the UK, when we entered in 2007, was largely principal oriented and today we shifted a strong majority over to a consignment basis instead, which we think is a better long-term alignment of our incentives with those of our sellers.  As opposed to being principals to trade against them, we are on the same side rooting for the highest possible sale price for those cars. Now the realms in which we do have more principal activity tend to be places where we are less established as a known brand and a known quantity. So today we are not yet a prominent consumer brand.  So it's tough to ask Bret Jordan to consign his car through us and assume that we'll get a good return for you. Instead, we can offer you a compelling price. You sell the car to us and we sell it in turn as a principal. And ditto in the UK in the early days. Today that's no longer necessary because we certainly are a well-established brand among the insurance industry and otherwise in the UK. The point being all long term as liquidity grows, as our recognition grows in those subsections of the marketplace, so to speak, will migrate to a consignment model. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And I guess one final question, just percentage. As you think about the running drive that what percentage of the cars that you are processing could be put back on the road in these emerging markets. I mean, obviously, some are beyond repair. But when you think about the mix, is it 30% or 40% of cars that you see in theory could be road worthy again? Jeff Liaw : Of the cars that are exported, I don't know off-head, Bret, so I don't want to speculate. But it's high. That number doesn't sound unreasonable to me in part because there is a natural filter, as you might imagine, for the kinds of cars that's even worth putting on a boat to get to Eastern Europe period.  You will filter out the cars that are pure metal content or a couple of recycled parts and then otherwise dispose them. They tend to by their nature be the more drivable repairable cars that would ever leave the country in the first place. Bret Jordan : Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on what you think are the biggest drivers of your non-insurance volume and in particular, the dealer cars, which we know from following KAR Global and ACV are under significant pressure as the chip shortage has weighed on new vehicle inventories and therefore new vehicle sales and used vehicle trade-ins.  Given your significant out-performance of the trend in dealer cars, I'm curious if you're doing anything differently or have changed your go-to-market strategy with regard to dealer cars or maybe it's a function of your greater capacity after the land purchases or just what has been the drivers there, and what do you think the longer-term potential for dealer cars might be? Jeff Liaw : Sure. Nothing radical in terms of our approach. We have a very capable sales team who approaches those dealers and communicates our value proposition to them being our global auction liquidity. Subjecting your car to a global buyer base and finding the best home for that car, whether it's in Ohio, Florida, Poland, or Honduras, I think there is a compelling value proposition there.  But there's nothing radical that we had changed in the last quarter or 2 or 3. This is the byproduct of the auction liquidity we've talked about a moment ago as well as our own proactive sales efforts. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. And I'm not sure what percent of the non-insurance cars you auction are whole cars as opposed to like non-insurance salvage cars. Maybe you can help us with that. And then of the whole cars, what percent are dealer cars versus from other sources such as off-lease, off rental, and repossession?  Because I think these other non-dealer whole car categories are down even more than the dealer cars. So just curious what you're seeing there too and if those other categories are also a potential source of share gain going forward beyond the opportunity in dealer cars. Jeff Liaw : The answer to your latter question is yes, those are also relevant and addressable for us. And all cars, as you all know, are on a spectrum. So even what you define as a salvage versus whole car is a more nuanced matter and simply than a binary distinction between the two. But we have grown our business very naturally, of course, the rental car Company with a car that's slightly damaged, or meaningfully damaged, we are absolute obvious home for it.  Older car, we're a good and obvious home for it as well. The newer rental cars, those of course are very meaningfully compressed in terms of industry -- available industry volume because of the shortage of new cars, the fleets are hanging onto cars they've got. But yes, long-term, those are addressable for us as well, addressable targets for us as well. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks. And just lastly, I want to follow up on your comment about higher used car prices being a global phenomenon. I found that quite interesting, curious if you could identify any trends that you're seeing in terms of used vehicle inflation by market?  I think it is more severe in the U.S. I don't know if you have any ideas as to why that might be or if that's not what you're seeing. And also, if used vehicle prices aren't inflating more in the U.S. than internationally and the U.S. dollar has somehow outperformed all expectations hanging in there very strong rallying recently, how does that impact affordability overseas for these cars? Jeff Liaw : I would say that I think of vehicles with some notable exceptions. The automotive industry is being a reasonably liquid global market so I don't think you could see 50% inflation for two-year-old Toyota Corollas in one market and 8% inflation in other currency adjusted. I do think we have observed increases in used car values around the world and most countries in which we do business.  There are sources of friction and distortion, of course, when comparing those trends, whether it's tariffs or shipping or otherwise. They can introduce discontinuities in that comparison. But by and large, I think of the vehicle business as being a global one in nature. In terms of the long-term trends -- short-term trends, I think we certainly can be affected by currency in any given auction in any given week in any given quarter, maybe in any given year. But I think the long-term trends of our cars being in higher demand in other countries still than they are in the U.S., that's not going away. That's over a multiple year horizon will dwarf any currency effects. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. Thanks for accepting me back in. It's a follow up to Bret's question. Just want to make sure I heard you correctly. You said the vast majority of the CAT cars hadn't been sold yet. Jeff Liaw : We sold a bunch, but the majority have not yet been sold. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. So are we thinking like it was 1 point or 2 point impact this quarter, is it like 2 to 3 or is it just much more than that? Any sense in the margin where it should be similar headwind, like how do we think about all that? Jeff Liaw : Yeah. As you know we don't provide any forward guidance. Those cars will sell, they will generate revenue. They do have costs associated with them. They'll have some implications. We'll talk about it next quarter. Chris Bottiglieri : It's okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for any closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Good. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Please standby. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. John North : During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse payroll tax benefits related to accounting for stock option exercises and certain discrete tax items. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management\u2019s current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. And so with that out of the way, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report a strong second quarter for fiscal 2022. I know that over the course of our discussion today, we\u2019ll naturally migrate to a discussion of near-term trends, such as driving patterns, new vehicle production, total loss frequency, cost inflation, market share trends and the like. But I\u2019ll start by observing that the long-term fundamentals of our business are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. Auction liquidity and returns, member recruitment and participation, our collaborative engagement with our clients day to day and in catastrophic situations. And certainly, our aggressive reinvestment in capacity, technology and people that make all of the above a reality. A quick thank you to the Copart team worldwide for their efforts in making these true. Our results in the second quarter financially were largely a continuation of what we experienced in the first quarter as we observe commerce and mobility continuing to trend back to the quote to new normal, which we\u2019ll elaborate on in greater detail. Accident and assignment volumes beginning and continuing to recover and ASPs remaining elevated as well. As I\u2019ve done previously, I\u2019ll elaborate on a handful of key themes for the quarter, and John will provide additional detail and perspective as well. Starting with our unit trends for the quarter, our unit sales globally increased 19% year-over-year, with a U.S. increase of 21% and an international increase of 9%. Our insurance business in the U.S., in particular, grew over the second quarter of 2021 by 21.5% and was also up on a two-year comparison versus fiscal 2020 due to the recovery I described a moment ago as well as share gains. Notably, our unit volume has been reduced by increasing used car prices, which I\u2019ll describe in greater detail momentarily. As we noted a moment ago, driving activity continues to rebound as measured across a number of different dimensions, including simply vehicle miles driven as measured by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the UK Department of Transport Statistics and gasoline consumption and a host of other statistics as well. We note, however, that the character of driving has evolved as well. With downtown office occupancy remaining quite low, driving is less focused at rush hour and more distributed over the course of the day. There are a number of other phenomenon that have emerged with COVID-19 with nuanced outcomes like that one. The next theme I\u2019d tackle is total loss frequency, which for the first time in our memory, we have noted has declined sequentially from the third quarter \u2013 calendar quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter from 19.3% to 19%. That\u2019s, of course, a very fine measure in that case. But in any case, it\u2019s the first time we have seen a decline as opposed to the long-standing increases we\u2019ve observed over the course of our 40-year history. This is a reflection of the very strong used car price environment and vehicle availability, used car availability, reducing assignment volume relative to what it otherwise would be. As most of you already well know, insurance companies typically compare the cost to repair a vehicle to the difference between the pre-accident value and what they can recover at an auction through Copart for the damaged vehicle. While our auction returns are at or near all-time highs and have kept pace with used car appreciation on a percentage basis, higher pre-accident values certainly do reduce our volume relative to what they otherwise would have been. As those who are following us in the industry in general would well know, there are a host of countervailing forces also working in our favor, which have been incorporated into our clients\u2019 total loss decision process to varying degrees, accident severity and repair costs are up. We are facing, and our clients are facing larger repair supplements, repair cycle times are up, parts are delayed and rentals are both longer and at higher rates than they ever have been. We certainly look to the 40-year trend in the 40-year history of total loss frequency as the right long-term perspective. Total loss frequency as a reminder, was 4% in 1980 and effectively 20% today, a fivefold increase over the company\u2019s history. We take that to mean that we\u2019re likely experiencing a temporary dislocation as a function of used car prices. The secular trends we have discussed previously remain true. Vehicle complexity rises, vehicle composition becomes less repairable substrates like composites and aluminum, making cars more expensive to repair. And our auction liquidity and international member base make them ever more efficient to total instead. We believe that as used vehicle values potentially peak and trend back to historical norms in the future, we may see some moderation in our ASPs will certainly benefit from volume increases as well. Moving to our non-insurance business. We\u2019ve continued to expand our market share there. Excluding cars as we customarily do, from sources such as wholesalers and charities, our U.S. non-insurance business grew on a unit basis by 4.5%, driven in part by growth in our Copart Direct business as well as consignments from rental fleets and financial institutions. Across our various non-insurance channels, we believe our growth is a reflection of market share capture as a function in turn of our auction liquidity and returns combined with our own proactive selling efforts. The cars we earn the right to sell on behalf of insurance companies through our online auction platform, no doubt, enables to \u2013 enable us to achieve superior returns for progressively more non-insurance cars as well. And in turn, these dealer, rental, bank and consumer cars further contribute to our auction liquidity, spinning the flywheel to benefit our insurance sellers as well. Turning then to our average selling prices. We continue to experience ASP strength as previously noted. Worldwide, our selling prices grew 20% year-over-year for the quarter. The Manheim used car vehicle index is currently at record levels in January at 236.3, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our selling prices, frankly, increased earlier, but have kept pace in the aggregate with the Manheim used car index. When we look forward prospectively, we note that a variety of industry sources indicate that chip shortages will persist for 2022 and potentially well into 2023. We\u2019ve seen a variety of forecasts. We are, from a business perspective, certainly prepared for the influx of volume that may come with softening in used car prices. With that, I will hand the call to John North. John North : Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll make a few comments on our operational results, and then we\u2019ll take a few questions. For the second quarter, global revenue increased $250 million or 40.6%, including a $3 million loss due to currency. Global service revenue increased to $178.5 million or 33.5%, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue grew 35.5% and international experienced an increase of 20%. Purchased vehicle sales increased 71.9% or 85.2% sorry, purchased vehicle sales increased $71.9 million or 85.2% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 84% over the prior year, and international grew 87%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales increased by $5 million overall. Global gross profit in the second quarter increased by $95.8 million or 31%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 350 basis points to 46.5%. U.S. margins declined from 52.2% to 49.4% and international margins decreased from 37.6% to 31.6%. The margin decline was primarily attributable to two factors : approximately 150 basis points of decline is due to the mix shift from a greater proportion of purchased vehicles, which have a lower gross margin, but a similar profit per vehicle. The balance of our margin contraction is attributable to cost inflation, offset partially by higher revenue per unit. There was a very modest impact to margin rate due to Hurricane Ida as we continue to incur expenses due to the sale of vehicles consigned to us from that event, although we have now sold through approximately 85% of our assignment volume from the storm. We remain excited by the opportunity to increase margin over time as we add additional scale and find further operational efficiencies through technology and innovation. I will now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation. G&A spend in the quarter increased $7 million from $35.8 million a year ago to $42.7 million this year and increased slightly on a sequential basis from $41.1 million last quarter. However, as a percentage of revenue, it\u2019s down 88 basis points to 4.9% compared to 5.8% last year. While G&A can be volatile from period to period, we anticipate G&A to continue to decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business and create additional leverage. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 34.5% from $258.2 million to $347.3 million. Second quarter income tax expense was $54.6 million, had a 16% effective tax rate, reflecting a $4 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options and a $17.5 million benefit associated with the discrete tax item, both of which have been adjusted for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 22.2%. Second quarter GAAP net income increased 49% from $193 million last year to $287 million this year. Adjusted to remove the tax benefits I described a moment ago, non-GAAP net income increased 39% from $191 million last year to $266 million in the second quarter of this year. Our global inventory at the end of January increased 8.4% from the last year. This is comprised of a year-over-year increase of 7.7% in the U.S. and 13.2% internationally. The increase in inventory is largely a function of accident frequency and miles driven or turning to normal, as Jeff mentioned previously, along with growth in our non-insurance business. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of January 31, 2022, we had $2.4 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with a capacity of over $1 billion. We amended our credit facility in December of last year, increasing the size to $1.25 billion, while lowering certain fees. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $53.5 million year-over-year to $446.5 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $91.5 million in capital expenditures in the quarter and approximately two-thirds of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. We are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure in our technology platform and believe this continued investment creates a durable value in enabling us to serve our current and future customers more effectively. And with that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks and take a few questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Labick : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with cost inflation, as you guys talked about it a bit in the prepared remarks. Obviously, it\u2019s not unique to Copart, the inflationary environment we\u2019re in. So maybe just help us understand the primary drivers of the cost inflation for you? Is it towing, labor, other? Where is it coming from? And really what remedies you\u2019re looking at and the opportunity to bring back kind of cost per unit to prior levels? Or how long do you think that might take? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Thanks, Bob, I think you may be astute preamble there that like all enterprises, frankly, across all industries, we experience inflation, we consume a mix of third-party goods and services and certainly employ a large number of team members worldwide. And so we\u2019ve always been subject to inflationary pressures. I\u2019d say, historically, on a more selective basis, whether it\u2019s health care or commodity cycles and the like. Today, there is more widespread inflation across our cost base overall. I think you are already aware of the major costs in our business, but they do include the towing, the personnel, certainly, our technology platform as well. We have some structural protection in that, as you know, we own the vast majority of our land. And so that cost is -- we already own the land outright and therefore, don\u2019t face the inflationary pressures when it comes to rental expense to the extent that we otherwise might. Historically speaking, over any intermediate term, Bob, we\u2019ve always demonstrated the ability to recover or more than recover inflation in the marketplace. And I don\u2019t think the expectation in this case would be any different long term. Now most importantly, we also strive for productivity enhancements and improvements over time to help absorb those same inflationary pressures, both before this wave courtesy of COVID-19 and otherwise. Bob Labick : Okay. Got it. Great. And then you\u2019ve obviously had a lot of success in growing not just the salvage and insurance cars, but beyond that to non-salvaged dealer cars and whatnot. Can you talk about, I know not in specific numbers per se, but the relative credibility of the gross profit per unit of the salvaged vehicles versus the, say, dealer or rental or repose? Jeff Liaw : I think it\u2019s tough to provide a sweeping answer that covers all such non-insurance categories. It\u2019s a little bit of a contrived catch all basket for us. There are certainly groups of those sellers, as you noted a moment ago, for whom the average selling price is higher than our typical insurance car. And therefore, the contribution may be higher as well. There are other categories included in that non-insurance portion that are lower average selling price than our typical insurance car. So on a tough to answer so on a blended basis, probably on average, higher, but distributed. Bob Labick : Okay. Great. And then last one for me. And I don\u2019t know if you guys are ready to answer this, not yet or not if it\u2019s too early, but I\u2019ll give it a shot. Obviously, you\u2019ve recently launched Copart Select and it\u2019s an attractive kind of less damaged non-insurance car, clean title, less damaged car auction. And so I was just curious if you could give your initial thoughts on the launch, if there\u2019s any surprises from the launch and how you think about Copart Select going forward? Jeff Liaw : Bob, you\u2019re always observant. On Copart Select, it is, as with many things we do at our action, we are innovating and experimenting and attempting new ways to position our auctions and the product that our sellers can sign through us. We think this kind of offering holds real promise. So, we\u2019re not yet ready to share substantive results, but it\u2019s the -- in keeping with the themes we\u2019ve addressed in the past through you and I have been talking about these kinds of pursuing this market in these kinds of cars for years now, and this is one more arrow in the quiver to tackle that marketplace. Bob Labick : Okay. Super. Good luck. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one on the pricing backdrop. Maybe first, Jeff, you made the comment the salvage market moved faster, but in aggregate, has kind of kept up with Manheim. Are you still as confident, now that we have the benefit of hindsight, that some of the more secular drivers, less damaged total loss vehicles, more improved auction liquidity were as big of ARPU drivers as we thought at the time? Or has hindsight proven that maybe that was more used car price driven than you initially thought? Just trying to understand that comment. Jeff Liaw : You were saying since March of 2020 or you were saying before that? Daniel Imbro : Yes, I feel like during 2020, some of the comments on the earnings calls discussed that you guys thought a lot of the maybe company-specific drivers, auction liquidity, things like that, were a larger contributor than used car pricing. The used car pricing was one of the inputs. Just trying to understand as we move further from it and gotten more data points, if your understanding is the same or if it\u2019s changed at all? Jeff Liaw : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed. I think it\u2019s been imprecise the whole time. When we look over the very long-term history, I think those secular drivers are unequivocally true, that they are newer cars that are totaled, less damaged cars there totaled. I think the auction liquidity is when we say that, those are objective measures, right? Those are the number of bids that are being submitted for a unit, the number of participants in a given auction, et cetera, et cetera. So those aren\u2019t -- that\u2019s much more science than art in that regard. Now as to precisely the trend for pricing for our cars in the pandemic and frankly, even the first year of the pandemic it was very different from the second in terms of the supply chain and used car availability and such. I think both were \u2013 both were factors, for sure, both our proactive efforts in both the character and the cars we\u2019re selling as well as the used car marketplace. Daniel Imbro : That\u2019s helpful. I wanted to ask one on the business mix. You\u2019ve always been growing revenue much faster into purchased vehicles, but part of that is just the way you reflect revenue. Has the unit -- have units also been shifting towards the purchase side in a similar way to the revenue we\u2019re seeing? And if so, why would that be? Is that a change in the U.S. insurance market? Or is there something else going on there? Jeff Liaw : Not a change in the U.S. insurance market. There are some portions of our business, including, for example, Copart Direct, the channel through which we purchase cars directly from consumers that yes, consumers will consign cars to Copart from time to time. But often, they prefer to deal on a principal basis for a price certain from us instead. So, as we grow that business, that is \"principal volume\" that drives growth in purchased car sales and purchased car costs. So that\u2019s an example of what would cause it, but it is not by and large U.S. insurance carriers shifting back to principal. They understand the merits of the consignment model in which they and we share in the upside of the highest possible returns on cars. Generally speaking, nobody moves back to principle, they move from principal to consignment over time. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. And then maybe last one for me. Thinking about ancillary services, periods [ph] last week talked more about maybe offering transportation. I\u2019m just curious if you guys have looked at that. I think you guys connect your buyers with transportation partners, but don\u2019t actually provide that service. Have you looked at that? Would it be ROIC accretive for you guys? And maybe anywhere else you see an opportunity to add ancillary services for either buyers or sellers to your platform today? Jeff Liaw : That\u2019s a perceptive question, in general, which is to say that the \u2013 as the leading marketplace online \u2013 global online marketplace for cars at the type that we sell. There may well be untapped potential when it comes to additional services that we offer the member base. I think, to be fair, there is a robust ecosystem of those service providers that has emerged around Copart as you might imagine, selling millions of cars a year to buyers worldwide. There certainly are transportation service providers. There are secondary storage providers and the like that have emerged proximate to Copart yards, and certainly who know many of our buyers firsthand as well. So the answer is, we are always evaluating those opportunities, experimenting with them trialing them. And from time to time, they stick and we expand them. So it is always on our radar. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s it from me guys. Thanks so much and best of luck. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Daniel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I think you are maybe reticent to discuss individual contract wins or customer relationships, et cetera. But I wanted to check in on the potential market share shift in the salvage auction industry. What you think your market share may now be? How much share you might have gained? And whether there are any practical or potential regulatory limits to your share in the U.S.? Or how much more room your share could run? And then on a related note, it would be great to get your thoughts on what has been the driver of your higher share, whether you may be competing on price or winning contracts based upon superior service level or greater ancillary services or just the net yield that sellers can realize as a result of your bigger buyer base, et cetera? Jeff Liaw : Got it. And as you might imagine, Ryan, I probably can\u2019t answer the first half of your question at all, and we don\u2019t discuss individual accounts, but certainly happy to comment on the second half of your question, which is, what is it that has driven our market share capture as a general theme, which I would say has been true for the past 40 years, not just the past few. And as for why we would win an individual account, I think the answer is often unsatisfying, we have a variety of things. It\u2019s not one singular theme, which I think our brains would prefer. But certainly, to articulate a few. Our auction returns are critical, and that is literally how much money we put in the pockets of our sellers after we auction the cars, which is a function of our DB3 online auction technology, which we believe is the best in the industry. It\u2019s a function of our ability to recruit new members and to engage them. It\u2019s a function of how quickly we can pick up cars and reduce the advanced charges experienced by our insurance company sellers. It is a function of our streamlining the purchase experience and making it ever easier for third parties to buy cars at Copart. It\u2019s also a function of the auction liquidity we\u2019ve talked about a few times on this call, which is that the growth of our insurance business has helped to affect the further growth of our insurance business did own non-insurance and vice versa. The second thing I\u2019d touch on is our approach to customer service, and we think a long-term horizon, take a long-term approach to problem solving on behalf of our customers. We believe that we re-earn the right to sell cars for our customers with every assignment that we get and that mindset starts with our founder, Willis Johnson and Jay Adair and to me and to the new hire, starts in New York well tomorrow morning. And that sounds like a throwaway cultural comment, but I think it absolutely rings true to us day-to-day here. And you would see it perhaps most pronounced in a catastrophic event when it is all hands on deck. And literally, all of us are physically or many even the executive leadership are on the ground, making sure that our teams are serving our clients capably. As one other example, we have acquired our physical land, nonstop in every instance we can for the past 40 years to ensure that we have the long-term ability to serve our customers that were never prisoners of \u2013 to third-parties who may prefer to do something else with the facility or otherwise. So it is a combination of those two. It is auction returns and the customer service mindset and having a long-term horizon, which we think has yielded those benefits over the long haul. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just lastly, for me, it was discussed some already, the degree to which your surging revenue per unit during the pandemic may have been attributable to various different factors, including, increased prices for used vehicles, metals, et cetera, versus your proactive efforts, including relative to mix, et cetera. But I think fee increases have not really been a driver, right? My understanding is you\u2019ve had more or less the same fee structure over this time that has just been applied to much more expensive vehicles. So if that is the case, do you think that there might be potential scope to increase the fee structure, particularly if we see some cooling off in used vehicle prices? I saw the mid-month Manheim finally ticked down today or some of the metal prices, which seem to have sort of peaked in kind of October type timeframe after surging every single month, in order to help offset some of these inflationary cost increases that you talked about? Jeff Liaw : We don\u2019t comment on our fee structures, unfortunately, but I would direct you back to the overall comment that over the \u2013 any intermediate horizon, we\u2019ve shown the ability to recover and more than recover inflation via both productivity and other measures we might take in the marketplace overall. So the \u2013 and the second point I\u2019d add is that if and when we see a moderation in used car prices, we\u2019ll almost certainly see a rebound or an increase in volume relative to where it otherwise would be as well. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : It was a good attempt. Hey, guys. So, yes first question is more gentle topic. But give me a sense of your exposure to like Russia, Ukraine, the neighboring Soviet blocks, and I would think they are probably 5% to 10% of sales, but maybe just give us some sense to that. And have you seen activity tighten up yet there? Is it like generally pretty healthy still? Jeff Liaw : Healthy? Less than that and healthy. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, good to hear. And then the other question is, to the extent you can comment on it. Can I reframe the question on used car pricing? I would think a lot of your fees are fixed to the buy side. I would guess they\u2019re probably fixed on the sell side on average. And then your price bands have a beta of less than one. So mix varies, but I guess my question is, is there like a rule of thumb you can give us for the ASP growth? Like what\u2019s the contribution of ARPU growth? Is there \u2013 any kind of like, I don\u2019t know, any way you could frame \u2013 that would help ease the discussion on used car pricing sensitivity? Is there some kind of rule of thumb or sensitivity factor we could apply? Jeff Liaw : We haven\u2019t shared those rules of thumb, Chris, in the past. We certainly do have a publicly published fee schedule for our members. So some of that math you can literally do by hand based on our \u2013 based on what\u2019s publicly available but we don\u2019t elaborate on fees. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, it\u2019s okay. Makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, I just to keep flogging that dead horse. Given that your fee structure does vary by transaction value, have you done the math to sort of explain from a correlation standpoint, what the relationship to Manheim is? You talked about some moderation in ASP in the prepared remarks, but do you have a feeling for what maybe what the actual statistical correlation of Manheim is to ASP? Jeff Liaw : Over the \u2013 I think it\u2019ll be tough \u2013 I think over the long haul, our ASPs have outpaced the Manheim. Let\u2019s stop the clock, March 2020. Our growth in ASPs have generally outpaced the Manheim used vehicle index, which is not a surprise given total lost frequency because lesser damaged cars and newer cars are totaled. So our mix naturally evolves over time. Manheim\u2019s mix naturally does not evolve over time. So, I would say that is \u2013 that has been true for many years pre-pandemic. During the pandemic for \u2013 as you heard us describe today, our growth in the quarter on ASPs was a little north of 20% while Manheim, I think for the quarter, is up 40%, 45% or thereabouts. And I think that reflects a lag in their index, I suppose the best way to describe it because from, say, pre-pandemic levels to today, both they and we have experienced the percentage increases in our selling prices that are plus or minus comparable. And therefore, I\u2019d argue that our prices increased earlier and today we are a plus or minus at parity relative to pre-pandemic levels. Over the long haul, I continue to believe we\u2019ll \u2013 our ASP growth will outpace theirs by virtue of the mix shift in total loss frequency before accounting for non-insurance business. Bret Jordan : Okay. And the other mix driver, or I guess, in your favor, is non-insurance, could you give us a little bit of an update as far as the dealer cars and maybe what the dealer relationship count is, or however, whatever metric you want to be using to measure the success in the dealer strategy? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it\u2019s \u2013 our non-insurance business, I think, Bret, is a mix of dealer cars, rental car companies, financial institutions, our Copart Direct business in which we buy cars directly from consumers, and all of the above. And all of the above are experiencing some of the same disruptions that we just talked about for the purposes of Manheim and our insurance cars as well, meaning there is use \u2013 there are used car availability challenges there. There\u2019s ample demand for cars, automotive dealers literally putting up billboards to buy cars, not to sell them. So, we\u2019re experiencing an unusual dislocation in that regard, but have nonetheless grown our non-insurance business year-over-year for the quarter by 4.5%. But individually, I think there\u2019s good traction there, which is a function again of returns and liquidity. Bret Jordan : All right. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Healy : Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about that tick down in total loss rates. When you look at that and see that, where do you see the total loss rate changing within your own business? Is it at lower dollar value cars or is it the middle or is it the high end? And how do you think that change in total loss rate actually impacted your ASPs this year? Was it helpful? Or was it hurting you guys depending on where it fell? Jeff Liaw : Tough question, because I think it\u2019s some place where we\u2019re mixing X and Y variables a little bit. But total lost frequency in general, the marginal car would be the higher end vehicle with insurance that is fixed instead of being repaired. If you\u2019re driving a 2008 car with any kind of meaningful impact, that\u2019s certainly an automatic total without much consideration. The newer cars are going to be the still somewhat more marginal ones. Now the reason that, and this is what I mean by X and Y variables, the reason why total loss frequency has tapered somewhat is because used car prices are as high as they are, meaning the cars are difficult to replace, availability is a problem outright. And certainly when you can\u2019t replace it, it\u2019s at higher prices, which makes the total loss decision, all else equal, more expensive than it otherwise would be. But those very same high use car prices that increase the selling prices for cars in Copart auctions as well. That\u2019s what I meant by the X and Y variables is that the underlying cause, strong use \u2013 unusually strong used car price environment has helped our ASPs overall. It perhaps has \"hurt\" our ASPs by cutting off a slice of the cars that otherwise would have been totaled. John Healy : Understood. And then I might have missed it, but did you guys quantify what volumes were for the U.S. and the international business in the quarter in terms of just how those occurred? Jeff Liaw : We shared growth numbers, John. You have them? John North : Yes. Global unit sales are up 19%, U.S. is up 20.8%, International was up 9.3%. John Healy : Great. Thank you, guys. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your question. Gary Prestopino : Hey, John. Hi, Jeff. Could you just \u2013 I didn\u2019t quite get the growth in U.S. purchase and international purchase sales for the quarter. Could you just give me that, please? John North : U.S. purchase was up 50.7% and international, was up 20 units. Gary Prestopino : What about sales? Did you give that number? John North : Gary, let me get it for you offline. We can go over the specific numbers. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That\u2019s fine. Jeff, just kind of a little rhetorical question here. As used car prices come down, which they are going to eventually, is there a pretty much a quick correlation with total loss ratios going up because these prices are going down? Jeff Liaw : In short, yes. There are other variables at play as well, which is there\u2019s a lot of confounding forces here that make it hard to give you a clean answer. But yes, certainly if nothing else in the world changed except the used car prices came down, we would see volume increase very meaningfully. And that\u2019s the same answer by the way, I would have given you in December 2019 or this is a non-pandemic observation. When we\u2019ve been asked in the past, do we want high use car prices or low used car prices? The response has generally been that high used car prices yield better unit economics for Copart, meaning we\u2019ll make more money on the cars we sell, but also fewer units because of the total loss equation. Lower used car prices means we will face less attractive per unit economics, but we would sell many more units. So, we\u2019ve always been ambivalent about used car prices and what it means for our business. And I suppose to characterize it more favorably, I\u2019d say we have a hedged position when it comes to used car prices. As for today\u2019s circumstances, I think we\u2019re facing a more extreme set of variables than we ever have seen, at least in my own professional career, when it comes to used car availability and prices. If those prices do come down, I think we absolutely would see an increase, all else equal, in consignments to us from insurance carriers. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then lastly, I don\u2019t know if you make this public, but could you give us an idea of what percentage of your cars are processed on a non-insurance basis this quarter versus, say, a year ago? Jeff Liaw : That\u2019s reasonably stable. I mean, it\u2019s approximately 25% in the U.S. here. Gary Prestopino : Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Stephanie Moore : Hi, thank you. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on \u2013 or return to this inflation discussion that we had earlier. I\u2019m curious, you kind of talked about remedies in terms of trying to overcome the inflation that I think pretty much every company in business is dealing with in this environment. I know that in the past there\u2019s been flexibility to adjust fee structures on the buy side, but what is the \u2013 your appetite and/or ability to have conversations with your insurance customers on the sell side to have them help offset some of this truly probably historical inflationary environment, especially with regards to some aspects like towing and others that they\u2019re directly benefiting from? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Got it. Thanks, Stephanie. Pricing is, as I\u2019m sure you can tell from this call and a couple of occasions, is a delicate subject for us that we tend not to discuss on earnings calls, public forums like this. Suffice it to say that our agreements with our sellers tend to run multiple years at a time because we make long-term commitments to them in the form of our land and technology and people and so forth, and they do in turn with us. So we take those commitments to certainly very seriously, and the contracts are where they are. It\u2019s our responsibility to manage our costs. And as I noted a moment ago, over any intermediate period of time, we have been able to recover and more than recover the inflation in the marketplace and through productivity enhancements. So unfortunately, we can\u2019t say much more about the pricing on either the seller or buyer side. Stephanie Moore : That\u2019s fair, and then just as a follow up, can you maybe discuss your towing process, i.e. the use of maybe company-owned trucks, the use of third-party brokers, just kind of what has been the normal practice and then maybe expanding on that, what might be an opportunity? Jeff Liaw : Got it. You mean the inbound retrieval of the cars that were part of it. Stephanie Moore : Yes, exactly. Jeff Liaw : So we use a mix of third parties as well as our own trucks, with a strong majority being the former, not the latter. We have the latter in terms of our own captive fleet, which has grown meaningfully over the past few years and will likely do so in the future as well to have additional capacity in the event of catastrophic events, for example. But we largely rely on third-party stockholders, who we dispatch directly so we don\u2019t use intermediaries by and large in our local markets circuit to put them across the U.S. We know the local companies and local towers and build long standing relationships with them so that they can effectively retrieve cars for us on a near-daily basis once they\u2019re on board. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then just \u2013 did you give, John, the U.S. ASP number? I know you gave the worldwide one, so wondering on that. John North : U.S. were up 20.3. Stephanie Moore : Great. Okay. Thanks so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Stephanie. Operator : And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jeff Liaw for closing remarks. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thanks for joining us today. We\u2019ll look forward to talking again after the third quarter. Take care. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John North, Chief Financial Officer of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. John North : Thanks. Good morning. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, legal matters and discrete income tax items. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with the corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management\u2019s current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. And so with that out of the way, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CO-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 as you are all, no doubt, well aware our industry and the global economy in general are experiencing a number of variables at unusual levels. New and used vehicle shortages, evolving workplace practices and traffic patterns, volatile and elevated fuel and commodity prices and the global instability. Against that backdrop, we continue to perform well for our customers and therefore by extension for our business as well. Our long-term core operating beliefs and principles remain unchanged. Above all else, we will invest in our physical infrastructure, our technology platform, our people and our customer service offerings to improve auction liquidity and returns for our sellers in our more mature markets. We\u2019ll continue to collaboratively engage with our sellers both day-to-day and through catastrophic events, including what appears to be an active storm season ahead to protect them and their policyholder relationships. We will actively expand our addressable markets by growing our volume of lesser damaged and whole cars from both insurance and non-insurance sellers, and we\u2019ll continue our expansion into international markets in Western Europe and beyond including Germany and Spain.  Let\u2019s turn into the events of the quarter. Our \u2013 starting with unit volume trends in our auction performance. Our global unit sales increased 12% year-over-year for the quarter with a U.S. increase of 11% and an international increase of 18%. Our insurance business itself grew relative to the third quarters of both last year and the year prior on a two-year basis due to a continued recovery in overall driving activity and accident frequency and severity. We\u2019d also note, however, the record high used vehicle prices have, for the past few quarters, negatively impacted total loss frequency and had tempered overall insurance volume growth relative to what it otherwise would have been.  On the notion of driving activity, at least as measured in vehicle miles driven as tracked by the U.S. Department of Transportation, for example, we\u2019ve seen a rebound in driving activity now to levels similar to pre-pandemic levels, including as measured by gasoline consumption and the like. The character of driving has evolved with less of course, workplace commuting, more leisure travel as a substitute. On the question of total loss frequency, contrary to very consistent long-term trends, total loss frequency has declined sequentially over the past few quarters and year-over-year with a strong used car price environment and vehicle availability reducing its time and volume relative to what it otherwise would be. While our auction returns themselves are at all-time highs and have kept pace with the used car market in general, higher pre-accident values do reduce volume relative to what it otherwise would be. In layman\u2019s terms, in a world in which replacement vehicles are hard to come by, total loss settlements are less compelling than they otherwise would be.  While total loss frequency has declined over the course of the past twelve months or so, the 40-year trend is nonetheless clear. We believe the market will ultimately revert to the historical norm of steadily rising total loss frequencies and in fact the number of other variables increasing accident severity, repair duration, repair labor cost, rental car cost and the like should contribute to that reversion, as well. The history of total loss frequency is quite clear. It was 4% or thereabouts in 1980 and is approximately 20% today and it in turn has been a product of two key factors. Vehicle complexity and composition have made cars more expensive to repair over time, while our auction liquidity and global buyer base have made them ever more efficient to total instead.  As used vehicle values eventually moderate and potentially trend back to lower levels in the future, we may see a moderation in our average selling prices as well. In that scenario, however, we believe we will benefit from volume increases perhaps substantially so. We continue to grow our business as well in noninsurance vehicles, including \u2013 excluding, pardon me, cars and sources like wholesalers and charities. Our U.S. non-insurance business grew approximately 3% in unit volume year-over-year, driven in part by growth in our consumer-based Cash For Cars business as well as growth in non-salvaged sources of volumes, such as rental car fleets, corporate fleets and financial institutions. Overall, our growth across a full spectrum of vehicles generates improved auction liquidity, auction attendance and returns for our sellers as well. The greater number of non-insurance cars we sell, whether they are from dealers or rental car companies, fleet managers, lenders or from consumers, ultimately contributes to auction liquidity and generating better returns for our insurance sellers in turn. I wanted to provide a few comments on environmental sustainability and governance matters before turning it over to John. We play a meaningful role in the global circular economy. We sold more than 3 million vehicles in our last fiscal year and estimate that 40% to 50% of those vehicles are ultimately returned to drivable services somewhere on the planet, and of course, the balance are subsequently harvested for parts and raw materials.  In both cases, we provide meaningful benefits to the world environmentally through the avoidance of manufacturing of vehicles and of replacement parts. According to recent research from Argonne National Laboratory, a science and engineering research house operated by the University of Chicago on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, the vehicle manufacturing process produces nearly 2 metric tons of CO2 per new vehicle manufactured. We estimate, therefore, that our business facilitates the avoidance of literally millions of carbon dioxide \u2013 millions of tons of carbon dioxide per year. Our business, especially given our emphasis on providing access to international buyers, also contributes to the advancement of other important societal objectives, including the reduction of global poverty with affordable transportation as a crucial lever and improved outcomes for people around the world and commuting to work, advancing their education or accessing medical care and the like. In the weeks ahead, we intend to publish our inaugural ESG report in which we'll provide additional disclosure about our role and impact in the circular economy. And with that, I'll turn it over to John North, our CFO, to walk through the third quarter financial results. John North : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll make a few comments on our results, and then we can open it up for some questions. For the third quarter, global revenue increased $206 million or 28%, which included a $7.2 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased $142.5 million or 23%, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume.  U.S. service revenue grew 23% and international experienced an increase of 19%, despite significant currency headwinds. We saw continued strength in average selling prices, which grew 13% year-over-year for the quarter. U.S. ASPs were up 14%. The Manheim Index is lower than January record levels, but remained historically elevated, ending April at 221.2, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. That trend has continued in May. The mid-month index, which was released a couple of days ago, is up sequentially 0.7% and 9.7% year-over-year. U.S. insurance pre-accident ACVs were up 29% or $3,700 roughly, as they continue to catch up with the reality of current used car values.  Purchased vehicles continue to comprise a larger percentage of our overall revenue mix, driven by both unprecedented used car values and growth in volumes, particularly in our consumer-facing Cash For Cars business in the United States and from expansion in Germany. Purchased vehicle sales increased $64 million or 58%. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 56% over the prior year, and international grew 62%. Purchased vehicle cost of sales grew $63 million or 66%, exceeding the growth in revenue. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit increased modestly by $800,000 or 5.3% overall. Global gross profit in the third quarter increased by $55 million or 14%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 550 basis points to 46.4%. U.S. margins decreased from 55% to 50%, and international margins decreased from 37% to 29%. As was true last quarter, this margin decline was primarily attributable to two factors.  Approximately 250 basis points of decline was due to purchased vehicles from both a mix shift to more of them and from the decline in gross margin rates on the vehicles relative to their absolute values increase; the balance of the margin contraction was attributable to cost inflation in both towing and labor, offset partially by higher revenue per unit and volume growth. We believe we can continue to increase margin and returns on capital over time, however, as we benefit from scale and find further operational efficiencies through technology and innovation. I will now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation. G&A spend in the quarter increased $11.1 million. Approximately, $6.6 million of the increase was attributable to certain out-of-legal items and we have presented this adjustment net of tax in our non-GAAP reconciliation.  Adjusting for this, our G&A increased $4.5 million or 11.5% from $39.1 million to $43.6 million. While G&A can be volatile from period-to-period, over the longer term, we anticipate G&A leverage to improve as we grow our business and create additional opportunities for efficiency. Our GAAP operating income increased by 14% from $328 million to $373 million and adjusting for the G&A item I mentioned a moment ago, it increased 16% to $379 million. Third quarter income tax expense was $91 million at a roughly 25% effective tax rate. Adjusting for the tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options, as well as certain legal matters and other discrete tax items, the effective tax rate would have been 25.2%. Third quarter GAAP net income decreased 3% from $287 million last year to 278 - $229 million, excuse me, this year. Adjusted to remove the items detailed in our pro forma reconciliation included in the press release, non-GAAP net income increased 7.4% from $262 million last year to $282 million in the third quarter of this year. Our global inventory at the end of April increased 5.3% from last year and 7% excluding low-value units from wholesalers and charities, for example. This is comprised of a year-over-year increase of 1.9% for the U.S. and 31% for international. The increase in inventory is largely a function of accident frequency and miles driven returning to normal, offset by a decline in total loss frequency, as Jeff commented on a few moments ago. Now to briefly highlight our liquidity and cash flow. As of April 30, 2022, we had $2.9 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1.2 billion.  Given the recent increase in interest rates, we have elected to call the $400 million of private placement notes due in $100 million tranches between now and 2029. We will incur a modest prepayment penalty, but believe this to be the superior choice given cash-on-hand and associated interest savings over the next seven years. We have notified the noteholders and anticipate retiring the debt early next week. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $48 million year-over-year to $417 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $79 million in capital expenditures in the quarter and over 80% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion as we continue to prioritize the investments Jeff spoke of a moment ago. And with that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks. We are happy to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS. Please proceed. Peter Lukas : Hi, good morning. It's Pete Lukas for Bob. You are showing nice unit growth and despite what we think a suppressed industry volumes due to lower total loss frequency and lower whole car auction volumes. Do you think you have sufficient capacity for expected volume growth when used car prices do recede? And what's the pipeline like for additional land purchases? Jeff Liaw : In short, the capacity efforts -- I appreciate the question, Pete, our capacity expansion efforts have been ongoing for years. You first heard about the 20/20/20 initiative in the spring of 2016. So that's six years ago and our land acquisition, as you know, during that period of time has been elevated even relative to our history, during which we bought lands almost as much as we could find. Nowadays, those land purchases continue and we do believe we're well equipped to handle a cyclical rebound as used car prices decline. So we can handle that volume as it comes, but we are still purchasing land in anticipation of future growth as well, both in the day-to-day business, as well as our catastrophic readiness in light of increased volatility. It's not just the need for more land overall. It's also to accommodate greater volume. It's also an increased ability to handle spikes that are attributable to storm activity as well. Peter Lukas : Great. And one more for me, just in terms of yard costs. Revenue unit and yard costs, the cost to process a unit are both rising rapidly. Can you talk about the outlook and drivers for cost to process a unit? And if inflation does abate, how much might yard cost pull back? And have there been any structural changes to the cost to process a unit? Jeff Liaw : I appreciate the question. No structural changes per se. I think, like many businesses or perhaps most businesses in this global economy, the inflationary forces \u2013 and we've always faced inflation in past quarters and past years, perhaps we'll be talking more about healthcare expenditures in some instances. In some cases, we talk about fuel and the like. Today, those key drivers, of course, are fuel, to the extent that we use our own fleet to pickup trucks, certainly, there are increased costs for vehicles and loaders and the like. And to the extent that we use third parties to manage our logistics or to retrieve vehicles for us, they in turn are facing elevated fuel, labor, vehicle costs and the like. So nothing unusual. So I wouldn't characterize it as a structural change or a structural shift, just the same underlying variables that most businesses are facing today. Peter Lukas : Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Pete. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody, and congrats on the quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Dan. Daniel Imbro : Jeff, I had a question on the total loss rate dynamics. I think it makes a lot of sense, obviously, with prices high, what's going on there. But for that to revert and for total loss rates start increasing, do we need prices to move absolutely lower? Or do they just need to stop increasing at these elevated rates? Or said another way, if prices were to stay higher for longer or maybe just slowly moderate from here, would that be enough to call a total loss rate to start increasing? Or do we really need to see a pretty steep move lower in pricing you think, before that reverts to the long-term trend? Jeff Liaw : A fair question. I think this is an unusual enough moment in history that it's tough to forecast from this as the baseline in the sense that this is the first time I can remember that I could sell my truck which is two years old for well north of what I paid for two years ago, having put 20,000 miles on it, right? So it's tough to extrapolate too much from today's trends. I don't think that's the \u2013 so I think a reversion to anything resembling historical norms, I think, would drive total loss frequency up. I don't think that necessarily means a very radical change in used car prices, but I think it does mean that used cars that are two years old can't sell for meaningfully more than new ones. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That's helpful. And then just moving to the non-insurance piece, obviously, a lot of change in the wholesale market now. I am curious with the sale of ADESA, how do you think that creates opportunities for Copart's non-insurance business, specifically thinking about things like repossessed vehicles, which need to be stored on land? And obviously, you guys have a huge advantage there.  Just curious how you view the wholesale market as a potentially growth opportunity and how that changes with what's going on with the sale of ADESA. Jeff Liaw : Yes. It's a fair question. I think, we perceived that and acted upon that kind of business as an opportunity for years and have pursued that business and built the capabilities to service those types of customers and have made good progress in that regard. Industry changes, like the one you mentioned, I think cause disruption to the status quo. So I think it's a potentially favorable catalyst for us. But ultimately, we still have to prove our value proposition, deliver excellent returns to our sellers, provide excellent service to them as well. So it's a helpful fact perhaps on the margin, but ultimately, the challenge is ours and we think we'll rise to meet it. Daniel Imbro : Perfect. And then last one, just kind of a modeling question, John, just following up. We've seen another step-up in the mix of vehicle sales for service. It looks like it's happening both in the U.S. and internationally. Is there any change on what insurance carriers provide there? Or can you provide some color maybe on why that step-up keeps continuing on the purchased vehicle side other than just used vehicle prices? John North : Yeah, I mean it's a combination of vehicle prices and also units. And as we mentioned, we've seen significant growth in the U.S. in our consumer-facing business, our Cash For Cars business, where we buy lower-value vehicles directly from consumers. That's been growing rapidly. We made great progress there. And it's incremental liquidity in the marketplace. So we are happy to have it. It doesn't displace other business in the U.S. per se. So we are happy to have those cars as well. Internationally, I think really it\u2019s a testament to the success we're having in Germany. We've seen great growth there in terms of assignment volume. And like many nascent markets, oftentimes, you are starting providing insurance carriers with more certainty, which requires a greater mix of purchased vehicle contracts.  That business evolved exactly the way it did in the U.S. and in the UK, whereas we build trust and relationships and demonstrate tangible returns to insurance carriers we can align and move to a more consignment-based model. And so you've seen both of those. Daniel Imbro : Great. It makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much, guys, and best of luck. John North : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And Jeff, congratulations on your promotion to Co-CEO. I guess, what should investors, clients or employees expect from that change? Jeff Liaw : I think, Copart, as you know, I think, has long been \u2013 has long had a very collaborative culture to begin with. So we make decisions based on the data and debating the merits of tabs X, Y, Z. So I think in many respects, business continued as it did before. I was President of the business before and worked closely with our international teams in our U.S. functions and our customers to drive excellent outcomes for them. So I think from your perspective and for most of the outside world, not a radical change from the day before. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. And your business is not overly cyclical, but to the extent the broader economy is headed for a recession, what can you do to prepare for that outcome? Jeff Liaw : A recession, which, of course is top of mind for everyone. I think the \u2013 historically, I would have told you that it can lead to higher unemployment. We are, of course, today at nearly all-time low unemployment levels, but it can lead to elevated unemployment and therefore a reduction in commuting for work and otherwise.  And of course, over the course of the past two years, we've seen a decline in that commuting traffic anyway even as the economies \u2013 the global economy has boomed. So I think it's difficult to prepare for it. I think our assumption is that we will have to continue growing our capacity and serving our customers with greater volumes tomorrow than today. And so, I think preparation - we are ready for it if it comes, but I don't know that it changes the trajectory of how we manage the business day-to-day. Craig Kennison : And I guess just as a follow-up related to National Powersports Auctions, are you seeing any rise in repossessions as the economy slows in that particular category? Jeff Liaw : If so, modestly. I think it's \u2013 we've been on a many year run of very low repossessions and certainly over the course of the past few years, because there is so much equity value in any loan outstanding that wasn't issued very, very recently.  Those are almost always in the money. So the repo volumes remain low even if you're struggling to make your payments, you can likely cash in your asset, whether that's a car or a bike for that matter for positive equity not negative. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. I wanted to ask a big-picture question. Obviously, land has been the right move for you guys for a long period of time. But Jeff, you made a comment about investing in the infrastructure at Copart. As I think about the needs of the business going forward and you talk about more volumes coming to you guys at some point with the total BOSS rate getting back on that long-term trajectory, how do you think about the towing capacity in the business?  And if volumes do pick up from here, are the pressures in towing only going to get worse? And is there any thought to potentially internalizing the logistics or towing side of the business? Obviously, the balance sheet is a fortress. And it would seem like you'd have the ability to maybe pivot to making towing an internal competency rather than an outsourced item and I would love to kind of hear your thoughts on the pluses and minuses of that. Jeff Liaw : Yes. Great question and one we are constantly reevaluating. I think first \u2013 the first half of your question, what happens when volumes pick up to our demand for towing capacity. I think there is so many confounding variables. The real question is what's caused that volume to go up, right? Is the used car prices have softened somewhat and so total loss frequency reverts to its historical trends and we see many more cars being towed instead of repaired.  That's one scenario. If you told me there were a dramatic global economic downturn, leading to very high unemployment and suddenly heightened availability of drivers that would be a different question altogether. But as to your more general question, we have long had a mix, certainly very heavily in favor of third-party contractors now for many, many years to retrieve vehicles for us, but we've also operated our own fleet.  Historically, the logic there was we wanted to have some capacity to serve, in particular in storms because that's when drivers are of course, in the shortest supply. When we certainly have elevated 5x, 10x ordinary day-to-day volume in a major metro area, having drivers migrate there from elsewhere in the U.S. is challenging.  So we have built our own capacity. Our catastrophic fleet, so to speak, to serve our customers in their times of need and ours. We are also evaluating doing more of that on a day-to-day basis as well, not per se because of the fortress balance sheet, but because it may allow us to better serve our customers. And so we have purchased certainly meaningfully more trucks in the past couple of years than we had previously for that express purpose. Long term, we continue to think there are technology solutions that can help increase efficiencies for our logistics, including by the way, expansion of footprints. Every new yard we add reduces to some extent, the miles that any given car has to be towed to get to a Copart facility but as well as our technology, our location-based driver apps, which help to better dispatch, better deploy our drivers, whether they are in-house employees or third parties. John Healy : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas Exane. Please proceed. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Want to follow-up on the purchased vehicle business a little bit. Is most of the growth in the U.S., is that coming from Copart Direct? Or are there other factors at work? And then, can you tell us more about that Copart Direct car? Is the average selling price materially different than your overall? And then I have like a related GM question for this business. John North : Yeah, I think we called it out specifically in the U.S., Chris, because that's been a significant driver of the purchased vehicle volume in the U.S. market. And certainly, it's \u2013 we've seen just overall vehicle inflation, which has driven the number higher as well, as I am sure you can appreciate. So whatever business we had a year ago is certainly up dramatically when you just think about the change in the Manheim Index year-over-year. So those are the two big factors there. In terms of the specific vehicle, I mean, go check out the website, it's cashforcars.com. Historically, we used to call it Copart Direct internally, but we have been branding it as Cash For Cars, and we put pretty dramatic resources into that business over the last couple of years and have seen pretty significant growth. So the average car is obviously significantly lower than our overall ASP. Think of these as the cars that would be a direct-to-wholesale piece. If you took into a CarMax or a Carvana, never a car that they are going to retail it\u2019s to the tune of $1,500 or $1,000 or something like that. Jeff Liaw : And then the growth otherwise in noninsurance also was driven by some of those other non-salvaged sources that we mentioned in the opening comments from rental car fleets corporate fleets, financial institutions and the like, so both. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. So then, just a related question, is the gross margins have been, I guess, under pressure for like six, seven quarters now? Can you kind of speak what's causing that? Like, what has the gross profit per purchased vehicle done over that same period? And one of it may be more stable in that metric. Can you just give us a sense for kind of how to think about the gross margins, the gross profit per vehicle in the purchase side? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think there's a little bit of splitting the difference. So, gross margin, when you say that, I think, mathematically, you literally mean the percentage, right? And so, that phenomenon is in part a shift to purchased vehicles.  And in practice, these are not \u2013 we manage the duration of these assets very aggressively or we don't want to own purchased cars speculatively or purchased by speculatively. We want to buy them when it makes sense to and when necessary and we want to sell them very quickly. So they are not long-duration assets and therefore, we manage them to absolute dollar profit. And just by its nature, you will make a higher percentage return on a $1,000 car than you will a $5,000 car. You'll make more on a $5,000 car in absolute dollars, but far less on a percentage basis.  So as we've seen an increase in purchased car mix, that drives the quote margin rate down, as we've seen an increase in the value of the average purchased car, you'll also observe a decline in the percentage rate as a result, as well. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. All right. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Jeff Liaw : Bret. Bret Jordan : On the non-insurance business, I mean, you called out Cash For Cars and fleet, you didn't mention dealer at all. Is that something that is really no longer a focus or maybe give us an update on how the lower-value dealer volumes look? Jeff Liaw : Yes. Dealer volume is incredibly important to us and has been for years. In this environment, as you are well aware of both the dealers, in particular, used car dealers are struggling for volume themselves. That remains a meaningful and profitable business for us and a huge long-term priority for us as well. We didn't call it out specifically in this quarter it was not a meaningful driver of growth for us for the quarter year-over-year. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess, as you've shifted to some of these higher value cars, purchased vehicles outside of the insurance space, could you update us maybe what percentage of your unit volume is run and drive? As we think about this as a cheap source of transportation globally, maybe how big a piece of your business is that? Jeff Liaw : So run and drive is a kind of a specific technical term. But to the \u2013 I made the comment actually in the ESG section. If you wanted to guess how many of our cars are ultimately driven as cars again as opposed to harvested for parts, metals and the like, we think it's approximately half.  Between 40% and 50% of the cars ultimately are used as cars, either in the U.S. or in the native market from which it originates or elsewhere in a developing economy where the cars are wrecked cars or incredibly desirable, drivable cars to them. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. And one last question, I think you called out Germany doing well now. Could you talk about the cadence of that business? Is there anything \u2013 I guess you talk about the economy in the U.S., but obviously, a lot of instability in Eastern Europe, if you talk about the sort of the trajectory there in the last couple of quarters, is it improving or any color would be helpful. Jeff Liaw : The unit volume trends in Germany are very encouraging. I think I mentioned on the last call, we are selling cars on a consignment basis for the majority of the Top-10 carriers in Germany, none yet with the nationwide all-in deal but certainly doing so at volume for a good number of insurance carriers today.  They are, as you noted, affected more so even in the U.S. by the instability \u2013 the regional instability, let's call it, as a good number of their buyers come from countries affected by the recent conflict. So they will feel that to some extent. But nevertheless, earning good consignment volume on behalf of insurance carriers making good forward progress there. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. I appreciate the comments on ADESA, thank you, and agree there is a clear market share opportunity for you in the physical or on-premise whole car auctions market including as ADESA's physical auctions business is sold to Carvana, which dealers regardless of their competitor.  Beyond ADESA losing market share though, another potential outcome of that transaction is, I think, an acceleration toward the app-based, online-only, dealer-to-dealer business or even the online off-premise commercial consignor business. I believe that you don't participate in these parts of the whole car market today because you take possession of all the vehicles you sell, I think. So I just wanted to check in on that with you if you have any updated thoughts on the online-only portion of the whole car market as you increasingly expand into whole cars. Would it be relatively difficult or easy do you think for you to transition your whole car offering to online only, which I think there has been some speculation could over time have attractively high margins and returns when at scale? Jeff Liaw : Yes. It's a fair question and many nested questions therein. As for whether that economic model is ultimately compelling, I think time will tell. And there, as you know, are a number of participants in that space, some publicly traded and others not. We do follow that business model carefully. We do experiment with offerings like that and in fact, have done so in our own business.  We do continue to believe that liquidity is paramount and so bringing the buyers and sellers together in an auction online, yes, but bringing them together in an online auction in which we achieve price discovery and maximum returns for our sellers is ultimately the way we deliver value to them. Now, whether that will someday be achieved virtually versus in our physical facilities, I think, remains to be seen.  But I don't think that's a structurally challenging pivot for us per se. But today, the strong majority of our cars, as you noted, are still \u2013 we are still physically touching them. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I think that there is obviously a number of macro factors helping you, including the rebound of miles driven, some of the increase in commodity prices since the conflict in Ukraine. But also isn't a lower dollar generally better for Copart given a greater translation of EBITDA and pounds back into dollars and because of the greater purchasing power of overseas customers in dollar terms?  So, the dollar has been arguably surprisingly stronger and so I am just curious if you could maybe dimension that stronger dollar headwind, if you see that, how large or forceful is that relative to some of these other macro tailwinds? And have you seen any impact yet on overseas demand from a stronger dollar? Jeff Liaw : Yes. In short, we have. I think the \u2013 let's say, not even the pound certainly, but also just the basket of international currencies period have certainly weakened relative to the dollar. And for the reasons you noted, we \"prefer\" a weaker dollar for our business both for the translation of earnings that we generate in other countries as well as for international participants at our U.S. auctions. So that has had an effect. It's no doubt been a headwind in the business. I think the good news in our business today is that the auction liquidity is robust enough that there are always a very healthy number of countries looking at and bidding on vehicles certainly many buyers in the U.S., across the U.S. and in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America and the like that are bidding.  So there is enough cumulative liquidity to mitigate those effects to some extent. But yes, if we woke up with a dollar at 2019 levels, we would see auction returns, all else equal, be meaningfully higher. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, could you \u2013 did you say or could you say what percentage of your buyers have historically been in Russia or Ukraine or what percent of your U.S. volume those countries might represent? Jeff Liaw : We haven't disclosed that. But it's \u2013 they are meaningful in the sense that there were years in which many high-value cars would be sold for example, to Ukraine and to Russia. It is \u2013 it matters, but it's not a large percentage overall. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Jeff Liaw for any closing remarks. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you, everybody. We'll talk to you again after the fourth quarter in September. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Gavin Renfrew, Vice President of Global Accounting of Copart, Inc. Please go ahead, sir. Gavin Renfrew : Thank you, and good morning. We'll start with the safe harbor. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, legal matters, discrete income tax items and the effect of the extinguishment of debt. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with the corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2021, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to our co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some comments about themes in our business. I'll turn it over to Gavin to walk you through some financial highlights, and then we'll take Q&A thereafter. We're pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and have concluded another strong fiscal year here at Copart. We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of our company's founding by Willis Johnson starting way back when with just a single yard in Vallejo, California. Since our inception, We believe it is our people and our values that have enabled us to build a profitable, sustainable enterprise. We're confident our formula will work for the next 40 years as well. We're well into our third year now of exceptional social and macroeconomic conditions of virus and its attendant mutations, a war and the disruptions on industrial production and supply chains, fuel prices and the like. All businesses, including ours, are affected by these forces. We're happy to take questions on short or medium-term volatility for the various input and output metrics for our business, but we'll focus our prepared remarks on a more durable operating beliefs and principles that guide our decision-making, namely that we will, one, invest in our physical infrastructure, technology platform and customer service offerings to improve auction, liquidity and returns for our sellers. We will collaboratively engage with our sellers, both day-to-day and through catastrophic events to protect them and their policyholder relationships. We will actively expand our addressable market by growing our volume of lesser damaged and whole cars from both insurance and noninsurance sellers. And finally, that will continue our expansion into international markets around the world. In a moment, we'll discuss the quantitative indicators that we customarily provide on these calls, but I wanted to start first by addressing the subject of sustainability. We are increasingly asked by our customers, our employees, our shareholders and other stakeholders about how Copart's business addresses the world's growing focus on sustainability. I want to offer our perspective on what sustainability means to us, how our business contributes to environmental sustainability, how we support and empower local communities, how we enable global economic mobility and development and how we build an enduring enterprise to serve our customers for decades to come. First, on the question of environmental sustainability, conventionally, what folks mean most of the time when they say so. We have the great privilege of operating a business that is at its core breed. We aren't trying to shoehorn an environmental theme into a fundamentally problematic business. Instead, Copart is a keystone enabler of the circular economy in the automotive sector. Our retrievable and storage of vehicles, title processing and online marketplace are essential to the reuse, harvesting and recycling of literally millions of cars per year. We estimate that approximately 2 out of every 5 vehicles we sell are driven again somewhere in the world, the remainder are harvested and recycled for parts or metals reducing the need for de novo mineral extraction and manufacturing emissions. The benefit of the reuse and recycling of cars and their components and the attendant avoidance of carbon emissions dwarfs our actual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We estimate this benefit to be more than 100x the quantity of our direct emissions. Secondly, we operate our business to enhance the sustainability and well-being of the communities in which we operate. Our business is essential in helping communities recover from acute weather events, which are themselves increasing in frequency as well. We currently operate purpose-built dedicated [indiscernible] yards comprising hundreds of acres of vacant storage capacity, reserves for responding to catastrophic events in storm-prone areas. When major weather events occur, our people and our advanced preparation enable us to clear roads, repair shops in [indiscernible] yards so that communities can quickly recover. Third, we enable global economic mobility and development. Through our unparalleled global member network, we facilitate access to vehicular transportation across the globe. We estimate that approximately 2/3 of the vehicles sold by our U.S. auctions to international members are to developing economies as defined by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Physical mobility, which most of us on this call have taken for granted is essential for people around the world to access health care, education, leisure and economic advancement. Finally, we operate our business in a manner that ensures enterprise sustainability. We believe that a truly sustainable business makes decisions so that it can serve its customers, not just in the weeks, months and years ahead, but for decades to come. To that end, we have always taken the strategic approach of owning the vast majority of our real estate and storage capacity. We've heard the sometimes persuasive arguments in favor of more \"capital-light\" approaches, but we're steadfast in our belief that owning our facilities enables us to control our own destiny, ensuring the sustainability of our business for our customers. We are not just participants in our industry, we are stewards of it. Today, we operate on nearly 16,000 acres of land worldwide and own approximately 90% of it, controlling it in perpetuity. Over the last 5 years alone, we've invested nearly $2 billion in land acquisition and development. Similarly, we have maintained a conservative balance sheet since our founding. We recognize the arguments in favor of more financial leverage, but we know that our approach assures our customers that whatever comes our way the 2009 financial crisis, massive storms in Sandy, Harvey, Ida, COVID-19 and all that lies ahead, Copart will stand uncompromised and ready to serve our customers. As noted on our last earnings call, we intend to publish our inaugural ESG report in the next few weeks in which we will, of course, more fully articulate these themes. I'll turn now to the operating statistics that we provide each quarter. Our global unit sales for the fourth quarter increased 5.1% year-over-year, with the U.S. increasing 4% and our international unit volume increasing 12%. Our insurance business was likewise above the fourth quarter of 2021. We grew on both a 1- and 2-year basis due to a combination of share gains and a continued recovery in driving activity and accident frequency and severity. Notably, of course, record high used vehicle prices have, for the past several quarters negatively impacted total loss frequency and have tempered overall insurance volume growth relative to what it otherwise would have been. Driving activity itself, as measured in vehicle miles driven, continues its rebound to pre-pandemic norms in the aggregate. Seasonally adjusted miles traveled for the month of May, for example, in the U.S. is up about 1 percentage point versus last year. Gasoline consumption statistics mirror the same themes as well. Contrary to consistent long-term trends, we have observed declining total loss frequency on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Our selling prices have kept pace or more than kept pace with a strong used car price environment on a percentage basis, but the persistent lack of replacement vehicle availability and record high retail transaction values continue to reduce assignment volume for us relative to what it otherwise would be. Total loss frequency for the second calendar quarter in 2022 was approximately 16.9% in comparison to 19.7% for the same quarter a year ago. If vehicles had been totaled at the same rate as last year, we would have observed insurance industry volumes 15% higher than what we actually experienced. In simple Layman's terms, in a world in which replacement vehicles are harder to come by, total loss settlements are a less attractive resolution to an auto accident claim than they otherwise would be. While total loss frequency has declined over the past 1.5 years or so, the 40-year trend is unambiguous. We believe firmly that the market will revert to the historical norm of steadily rising total loss frequency in the months and years ahead. And in fact, a number of other variables, accident severity, repair duration, repair, labor costs, rental car cost, part costs should contribute to that reversion and long-term trend as well. The history of total loss frequency from 4% in 1980 or so to 20% as of a couple of years ago, has been the product of 2 key factors : vehicle complexity and composition, making cars more expensive to repair while our auction liquidity and global buyer base has made them more efficient to total instead. While we will all no doubt struggle to predict precisely when supply chain bottlenecks will clear, and new vehicle production will return to historical levels, we do anticipate an eventual unwinding of these conditions, which will lead to a moderation of used vehicle values. We may well see a moderation of ASPs in that environment as well, but will almost certainly benefit from volume recovery or volume increases as well. We continue to invest in growing our business beyond insurance total losses, excluding lower value cars from sources such as wholesalers and charities, our U.S. noninsurance unit volume grew approximately 6% in the quarter, driven by a combination of rental cars, corporate fleets, financial institutions and our power sports business. Our growth across the full spectrum of vehicles enhances our auction liquidity and returns for our sellers. The more cars we sell for -- the more cars we sell on behalf of dealers, rental car companies, fleet managers and the like, the more our insurance company sellers will benefit as well.  With that, I'll turn it over to our VP of Global Accounting, Gavin Renfrew to walk through the fourth quarter financial results before we open it up for Q&A. Gavin Renfrew : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I will make a few comments on our operational results, and then we will take questions. For the fourth quarter, global revenue increased $134.8 million or 18%, including a $16.4 million headwind due to currency. Global revenue for the fiscal year increased $808.4 million or 30%, including a $22.2 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased $87.8 million or 14.2% for the fourth quarter and $561.2 million or 24.5% for the year, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue grew 14.7% for the quarter and 25.6% for the year and international experienced an increase of 9.4% for the quarter and 16.6% for the year. We saw continued strength in ASPs, which grew 8.3% year-over-year for the quarter, with U.S. ASPs up 9.2%. The Manheim Index is lower than January record levels of 236.3 but remains historically elevated, ending July at 219.6, an increase of 12.5% year-over-year. August mid-month is 211.6, down sequentially, 3.6% versus July, but still up 8.8% versus last year. Purchased vehicles continued to comprise an increasing percentage of our overall revenue mix, driven by both strong used car values and growth in volume, particularly in our Cash For Cars business in the U.K. and from expansion in Germany. Purchased vehicle sales for the quarter increased $47 million or 36.5%, and increased $247.2 million or 61.7% for the fiscal year. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter was up 39.3% over the prior year and 61.8% for FY '22. International grew by 31.5% for the quarter and 61.5% for the year. Purchased vehicle cost of sales grew $47.6 million or 41.9% in the fourth quarter and $239.1 million or 69.1% for the year exceeding the growth in revenue. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit decreased slightly by $0.6 million or 4.2% during the quarter. For the fiscal year, purchased vehicle gross profit increased $8.2 million or 15%. Global gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by $24.1 million or 6.7% and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 455 basis points to 43.2%. U.S. margins decreased from 51% to 46.3% and international margins decreased from 29.6% to 26.1%. For FY '22, global gross profit increased by $263.1 million or 19.6% and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 400 basis points to 45.9%. U.S. margins decreased from 52.6% to 48.9% and international margins decreased from 35.1% to 29.9%. As was true last quarter, this margin decline was primarily attributable to 2 factors : 200 to 225 basis points of the fiscal year decline was due to purchased vehicles from both a mix shift to purchased vehicles and from the contraction in gross margin rate on our purchased vehicles as the absolute values of those vehicles increase. The balance of our margin contraction is attributable to cost inflation in both towing and labor, offset partially by higher revenue per unit and volume growth. However, we believe we can continue to increase margin and returns on capital over time, as we benefit from scale and find further operational efficiencies through technology and innovation. I will now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. G&A spend in the quarter increased $3.6 million or 9.2%. For the year, G&A spend increased to $27.6 million or 18.4%. Approximately $6.6 million of the increase is attributable to certain discrete legal items, and we presented this adjustment net of tax in our non-GAAP reconciliation. Adjusting for this discrete item, our G&A increased $21 million or 14% from $149.8 million to $170.7 million. While G&A can be volatile from period to period, over the longer term, we anticipate G&A to decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business and create additional leverage. Our GAAP operating income increased by 7.7% from $301.5 million to $324.8 million for the fourth quarter, including a $2.3 million headwind due to currency. For the fiscal year, GAAP operating income increased by $238.6 million or 21%. And adjusting for the G&A item I mentioned a moment ago, it increased 21.2% to $1.38 billion. Fourth quarter income tax expense was $39.7 million at a 31 -- sorry, at a 13.1% effective tax rate. Adjusting for the tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options as well as the effect of extinguishment of debt, net of tax on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 15.2%. For the year, income tax expense was $250.8 million, for an 18.7% effective tax rate with an associated non-GAAP full year expense of $287.9 million for an effective tax rate of 21.1%. Fourth quarter GAAP net income increased 3% from $256 million last year to $263.7 million this year. Adjusted to remove the items detailed in our pro forma reconciliation included in our press release, non-GAAP net income increased 9.6% from $247.7 million last year to $271.6 million in the fourth quarter of FY '22. GAAP net income for FY '22 increased 16.4% to $1.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income increased 21%. Our global inventory at the end of July decreased 5.7% from last year and 2.7% excluding low-value units like wholesalers and charities. That is comprised of a year-over-year decrease of 9.6% for U.S. inventory and an increase of 24.9% for international inventory. As Jeff mentioned a moment ago, for the first time in recent history, the number of total losses as a percentage of overall accident has been declining. As a result, our inventory levels are modestly lower than they were a year ago. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of July 31, 2022, we had $2.6 billion of liquidity, comprising of $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of $1.2 billion. As we discussed on our last earnings call, in the fourth quarter, we retired $400 million of private placement notes outstanding. We incurred a prepayment penalty of $16.8 million in the quarter associated with the retirement, which is nearly equivalent to 1 year of interest payments if the notes had not been retired. We believe this to be the superior choice given cash on hand, projected interest savings and the relative inflexibility of these private placement notes. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $84.1 million year-over-year to $312.8 million, driven by stronger earnings and the cost associated with the extinguishment of debt. We invested $102.6 million in capital expenditures in the quarter, and over $300 million for the fiscal year, with over 80% of this amount attributable to capital -- sorry, to capacity expansion as we are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure. Despite unusual near-term forces that have suppressed unit sales relative to where they would have been, we continue to invest in capacity with the conviction that we and our customers will need it. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : Congratulations on another fantastic year. So I just wanted to start with the short-term when you obviously discussed costs rising related to towing and labor, and I assume fuel is embedded in that towing discussion. And we did some quick math, if it's right, like there was even a sequential growth in cost per unit from last quarter. So I guess the question is what actions are you taking now? Or can you take to reduce cost per unit? And how long might that take to kind of flow through to get lower cost per unit, better unit economics in that regard? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Bob, I think in short, the optimizing the efficiency of our business is a forever initiative regardless. So it's not per se in response to rising fuel prices or labor costs, et cetera. It's that phenomenon inflation, broadly speaking, has always been true. And where we precisely see it in the business at any moment in time can vary sometimes it's fuel, sometimes it's health care, sometimes it's commodities otherwise. But the efficiency initiatives we pursue are self-evident in some regards, but we endeavor to automate much of what we do, including the dispatching of our drivers to retrieve vehicles to optimize the routes to minimize waste in the retrieval of vehicles. For example, we endeavor to automate our interactions with our members and our sellers in ways that make it easier for them and for us to run the business day to day. So the real answer to your question is it's not specifically in response to those catalysts, but those productivity initiatives have been true forever and we are attacking them with the same deal as we always have. Bob Labick : Okay. Great. I understand. And then a little more big picture. I guess, what, if anything, has changed in the insurance and salvage process since the pre-pandemic? In other words, have you added new service for the insurance companies or new products or differentiated offerings that may also come with a cost to you, but it's obviously part of what you provide your insurance customers. How has anything changed since pre-pandemic? And I'm trying to think about like adding to the unit cost over time, but for a good reason kind of thing. Jeff Liaw : Yes. That's a fair question, Bob, and I think an astute observation that in general, the early days of the pandemic were such that many companies, insurance companies included, wanted to avoid in-person engagement for themselves and their customers for obvious reasons to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 itself. And then since then, of course, they have faced some of the same hiring and retention challenges that the economy more broadly has as well. And as a result, they are asking us to do more, and we are offering to do more. In some -- to give you specific examples, we have many fewer insurance company employees who are day-to-day visiting our yards to do their work and we've instead virtualized much of that workflow for them, doing it on their behalf and conveying that information digitally so that they can process those vehicles without coming to see us first hand. There are also other further downstream processes involving title and otherwise that we now do on their behalf that perhaps they previously had retained a larger department to do on their own. So I think that's a long-term trend anyway really before the pandemic but certainly accelerated by the pandemic and likely will persist. So we are happy to perform those services on behalf of our insurance companies. We think we can ultimately do so more efficiently and do it well for them on terms that make economic sense for them and for us. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Baird. Craig Kennison : We get a lot of questions on the dynamic with respect to volume and then also just price. You mentioned the Manheim Index being at a record level. If we revert to a scenario in which volume sort of dominates driven by a higher total loss rate, but price comes down. How would you say that will impact your revenue algorithm kind of in the near-term and the long-term? On the long-term side, I'm sure if volume grows, that's great for you. But in the short-term, if you see prices drop while volume recovers, but maybe at a slower rate. Could there be an air pocket there? That's the question we get. Jeff Liaw : Fair question, Craig. And one we've wrestled with forever, even outside the parameters of what is currently a once in a lifetime [indiscernible] inversion, where we've never seen this before. But even 5 years ago, when we were facing the same questions, do we, in general, favor high used car prices or low used car prices, we've always been ambivalent about it. The lower used car prices will no doubt lead to more assignments to us and will probably be to lower realized ASPs, all else equal as well. So the unit economics will be modestly worse, but we'll certainly see greater unit volume as well. So we -- I think to be transparent, Craig, don't know precisely, right? The matter of degrees. And so if the volume increases significantly and the price moderates modestly, there's no doubt that's beneficial to us. Could there be other such scenarios, I think, yes, the 40-year trend says that the economics will work themselves out quite well in the end. But as for what happens for what happens in a given month or quarter or perhaps even fiscal year, harder to be precise about that. Craig Kennison : And then with respect to Europe, have you run any game plan scenarios with the energy crisis and potential recession there. I'm curious are you selling partners changing their behavior in any ways based on less volume, if there's less driving, for example. And then on the demand side, with the strong dollar, and potential uncertainty in that market? Are you seeing any behavior changes there? Jeff Liaw : I'll separate those two questions for a minute, Craig. First, on the notion of insurance company practices in Europe. I wouldn't -- besides the same themes I mentioned a moment ago about insurance companies as a general matter asking us to do more and our offering to do more in the claims process relative to what we used to do. Besides that, I wouldn't note any radical changes in the way they have managed their businesses over the course of the past couple of years or since the beginning of the war I think is the specific catalyst you're asking about. And then -- and to your second question then about currency fluctuations, I think you know this already. We are short the dollar in our business. We favor a weaker dollar, which leads to better auction returns on the margin for us given our robust global buyer network. At any given moment in time, I think we see currency fluctuations across countries such that some are more in the money or some are more out of the money relative to where they were a year ago. So in the aggregate, I think we -- our auctions are performing just fine. As for how we approach in our game planning for Europe, we aren't going to be affected by what happens in the next month or 2, right? That's not the horizon with which we're making our business decisions anyway there, here or anywhere. So what we specifically see on natural gas shortages or what have you, we certainly observe them, we take stock, we understand how to communicate with our customers given that backdrop, but it doesn't change our strategic approach. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Joe Enderlin : This is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel Imbro. So our question, when looking at service vehicle gross margin pressure specifically, could you talk about what the biggest drivers of pressure you've seen? And then could you touch on any new developments you've seen on towing costs? Jeff Liaw : I think the pressure is Gavin talked about them to some -- in his prepared remarks. But we're observing the same inflationary forces that the folks are across industries. So whether it is fuel costs, labor costs, both in-house and third party. Those are the same forces, I think, that every business literally worldwide is observing today. So nothing particularly unique in that regard. As for the economics of the business, gross margin, as you know, is a function of both of the cost as well as the revenue. On the revenue side, we continue to benefit, of course, from a robust used car environment, robust selling prices, our auction liquidity is stronger than it ever has been. And so the realized returns we achieved at auction are certainly the offsetting consideration there as well. Joe Enderlin : Got it. That's super helpful. As a follow-up, I was wondering how you're looking at the returns on capital between share repurchase and land expansion at this point. You likely have capacity to pursue both, but how are you feeling about priority between these 2? Jeff Liaw : The priority certainly is always to invest in, and this is what any good steward of capital would, I think, is the framework they would approach the question with, which is how do we maximize those returns over 30-, 40-, 50-year horizons. And if that is your framework, we would always elect to invest productively in the business long-term. There is power in the network. There's power in physical capacity. There's power, as you heard me say, in owning it and controlling it in perpetuity. We generate cash, of course, net of those investments as well. As you know, from our history, we buy shares back. We do so aggressively in real volume. We also do so episodically as opposed to via a predictable routine buyback program. So at some point, we don't announce in advance. But at some point, we, of course, will buy shares back that ultimately is the use of residual capital. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. ChrisBottiglieri : Jeff, I think you said 2 out of every 5 cars are put back on the road today. I guess where do the metrics stand before the great financial crisis? And can you give us a sense of how price and volumes change on the financial crisis of these types of vehicles? Just trying to understand if this is becoming more cyclical as you successfully disrupted international markets and traditional wholesale auction model or if like supply is the bigger factor other than demand is my first question. Jeff Liaw : I missed the critical first phrase. Can you say it again, Chris? ChrisBottiglieri : Yes. So I'm just trying to understand like you have 2 out of every 5 cars are putting back on the road, like where did that metric stand before the great financial crisis, like where are drivable cars before then? Just trying to understand that this is becoming more cyclical as you've just gone more to international markets, you've gone to the Copart Direct, as you've gone through the dealer consignment business. Jeff Liaw : Got it. I think directionally, Chris, meaningfully lower, but that's not per se a function of macroeconomic conditions. So global financial crisis, if we're talking 2008 -- 2007 Horizon, pre [GFC], that is a full 15 years ago, total loss frequency meaningfully lower than it is now. And so the reason we have so many more drivable cars today is that it is economically attractive to total those cars in a way that it wasn't 15 years ago. Our buyer base, our international auctions, our online technology is such that we can generate returns that justify totaling those cars instead of repairing them. So it's not a function per se of economic growth or recessions or interest rates or what have you, it's that the fastest-growing economies worldwide as a general rule have the lowest vehicle penetration and the greatest incremental vehicle demand. So as we tap into that trend, certainly has increased the number of drivable vehicles we sell has over the past 15 years and almost certainly will over the next 15 years as well. ChrisBottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And maybe a bigger picture question longer term, just your ESG report coming out. I wonder like how much work you've done on the impact of electrification, particularly like battery electric vehicles? Like what are you seeing today in terms of -- another obviously a very small population of cars. They're very young on average. There's just not a lot of data yet. We have to hit your sweet spot. But in the early findings of these earliest EVs, what are you seeing in terms of total loss rates? Are these cars more or less likely to be totaled at a given age? And then two, what are you seeing in terms of like the proceeds value as a percentage of, call it, like ACV or something? What are you seeing on the EV side? Jeff Liaw : Fantastic questions and complicated ones. First, and difficult to isolate specifically because there are, as you know, sparing the few cars for which we have a controlled experiment of an electrical -- electric version and an internal combustion engine version like-for-like. And so comparing the two when it comes to total loss frequency, repair costs and auction returns is difficult. What I would tell you, so far, however, is that electric vehicles, perhaps by virtue of being newer, having more safety technologies, more perimeter sensors, almost always in the form of cameras in the front to enable autonomous braking and the like or even autonomous driving like features. Those cars total more easily, the repair costs are high. In many cases, the automotive repair networks around the world are not yet equipped to handle those cars either to calibrate the sensors, to repair the cars, to source the replacement parts, especially in this environment. If anything, those cars total more easily than conventional vehicles would. As for auction returns, though, as you noted, it's early and therefore, the addressable population remains small on balance, the returns on electric vehicles are meaningfully higher than for internal combustion engine equivalents, though, again, with the caveat that the expression equivalent is a very rough one because the perfect apples-to-apples comparison is not always readily available. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : How should we think about the outlook for agency model average revenue per unit tracking going forward with, on the one hand, declining used vehicle and scrap metal prices. But on the other hand, the tailwind from more higher-priced non-salvaged vehicles and maybe any potential fee actions you could take as selling prices decline? And then what do you think the margin implications are going forward on the one hand, the direction of selling prices, which I'm presuming is down. And on the other hand, the operating leverage provided as volumes normalize higher? Jeff Liaw : Ryan, good to hear from you. And fair questions, probably along the same lines as a few callers ago. On the question of incremental volume versus incremental ASP and how they interact, my answer then is that we are somewhat ambivalent between the two. High used car price environment like the one we're in now means that our unit economics are excellent, but it also means that our volume is compromised relative to where it otherwise would be. As for then how we would feel about movements of x percent versus y percent in each is a question about elasticity and forecasting that in advance is hard to say. We actually don't know precisely which is \"better\" for the bottom line. Long-term, I think the volume growth will no doubt be positive and meaningful as it has been for the past 40 years. So total loss frequency will be the tailwind behind the business. But as for the near-term, P&L effects of a slight drop in ASPs and a bump in volume precisely how that unfolds, we don't know. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then how should we think about -- just lastly here, the trend in land purchases tracking going forward after a step-up in recent years, maybe as you were anticipating some of these market share gains and expecting volume recovery, et cetera. But how should we think about land purchases tracking? And then the implications of that for the conversion of EBITDA into free cash flow and capital allocation optionality. Jeff Liaw : Sure. As for investing in land, I think you've heard me say this on prior calls, too, that becomes a very specific macroeconomic exercise in which we evaluate metro by metro and even metro areas of the northwest portion of metro x, we analyze our capacity and our expected capacity given growth in total loss frequency given, of course, as you noted, market share aspirations, given growth in our noninsurance business, what storage needs, we anticipate in a given market. So it's not an aggregate corporate decision. We don't wake up in a quarter and say, let's go spend $150 million this quarter. Instead, it's a macroeconomic question that we face market by market. In the aggregate, given that total loss frequency expectation, given our volume growth aspirations, we do expect to continue to invest in that capacity for years to come. So it has been, as you know, turbocharged say, since 2016 or so relative to historical periods before that, but we continue to believe that controlling our own destiny, investing in physical infrastructure is a key enabler in our business, and we'll continue to do that. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Maybe just one last one on market share. Do you know what your market share is? I think it was already possibly over 50% before some recent contract wins. And wasn't there a case where maybe, I forget when in the '90s, is that [Manheim] have had to sell some yards via some, I forget, arrangement with the Federal Trade Commission to ADESA when their market share was over a certain amount. I forget what it was maybe 65%, 70% or something like that. Are there any read-throughs to the salvage industry? Do you intend to just keep driving share higher? Is there any kind of practical limit or what do you think? Jeff Liaw : Difficult for us to comment on market share. In the same way that talking about market share in the aggregate is a little bit like answering how much do we want to invest in land in the next quarter. But every customer to us, whether we have all of their business, some of it or none of it is really important to us, and we spend a hell of a lot of our energy serving them and persuading them to do business with us, to do more business with us, to shift the business to us, et cetera. So that is, again, a microeconomic question, not a macroeconomic one. I'd also note that, as you probably remember, 1/4 of our cars today come from noninsurance sources, and we continue to believe that we can grow in that arena as well. So we don't do market share calculations along the lines of what you described. And if we did, we would look at the automotive industry more broadly and look at it worldwide, in which case our market share, of course, is quite a bit less than the range as you were citing and our addressable market quite a bit bigger. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit about specifically the German market, what you're seeing as far as traction there with insurance companies? Jeff Liaw : Yes. And for folks who are new to us, we elaborated a few -- I think it was end of fiscal '19 or '20 on our earnings call in much greater detail, about our approach to the German market. Most of those themes remain true, which is to say that the business model to date that has been deployed by insurance companies in Germany is very different from how we operate in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil, the Middle East, Finland, for that matter, other major markets in which we participate today. The model that we offer is a liquid auction as opposed to a listing service model that exists there today. And we're working with the insurance carriers to effectively convert the market to a different way of doing business. So it's not per se head-to-head competition against the Copart like market participants, but instead a changing of the market altogether. Today, we are selling cars on an agency basis on behalf of 7 of the top 10 insurance carriers in Germany. We do not yet have a national account across the entirety of Germany, but we're working closely with insurance carriers. I think our returns to date have demonstrated the superiority of our approach. We're investing in the land and people, technology and infrastructure to enable us to provide that service in mass to Germany and continue our progress there. Germany, I think you mentioned, Western Europe, and I think appropriately so, is the biggest and arguably most promising market in Western Europe, but we expect to or aspire to extend our footprint beyond Germany as well. Bret Jordan : And then a quick question on noninsurance. You sort of called out rental and fleet and finance costs. But could you talk about what you're seeing in the dealer market now? Obviously, that was something that has shown some potential a year or two ago. And in addition to the dealer, just sort of a follow-up on that same question, what's been the trend of ASPs in the noninsurance units, obviously, dropping charity and picking up some more of these sort of whole car type vehicles might be favorable. Jeff Liaw : Yes. So I'll start with the first question on the dealer business. They are an important constituent for Copart today and have been for years. So we -- our Copart dealer Services business in the U.S. and elsewhere continues to pursue that business. It won't surprise you that the dealers are short on cars as well these days new and used, but we have nonetheless -- nonetheless, continue to grow our business among the dealer sellers at Copart broadly speaking. Your second question about the ASP effect. I think there is some \"favorable\" mix shift, of course, in combination with what is a robust ASP market overall. So I couldn't isolate for you the two effect spread but both are favorable. Operator : Our next question is from Ali Faghri with Guggenheim. Ali Faghri : My first question is on the near-term outlook for total loss frequency since it clearly represents a big headwind to your volume growth right now. Are you seeing any signs of total loss rates troughing and starting to higher again? It seems like we're finally seeing used car pricing normalize and at the same time, vehicle repair costs are also increasing at a more rapid rate. So it would seem like the elements are in place to drive total loss rates higher. And I guess, as part of this, how long do you think it would take to get back up to that 20-plus percent rate of total losses we were at coming into the pandemic? Jeff Liaw : I think the transparency, all these, we don't know precisely. Total loss frequency itself, as you probably appreciate, is a lagging indicator because the accidents happen. It takes x weeks for the cars claim to be resolved via a written estimate being provided to the insurance carrier in some cases, discussions or negotiations with the policyholder and owner of the car; in some cases, subrogation from one insurance carrier to another. So by the time the car is totaled, you are weeks after the accident itself occurred and the economic decisions are themselves made on a huge basket of inputs, including what the cars worth intact for the ACV to use a U.S. expression or PAV, pre-accident value to use a worldwide expression instead. The repair estimates, as you note, are increasing in price, rental car costs remain elevated as well. And so that basket of inputs is plugged into a formulaic position plus policyholder considerations and whether the insurance carrier perceives that is a desirable outcome from the policyholders perspective or not. So that's all to say that is complex enough that you couldn't look at any single variable if you had theoretical access to every data point inside of Copart. It's not clear what individual metric you look for to see a \"turn\" in total loss frequency. We're confident that will happen as for the horizon and when exactly it reaches then 19%, again, 20% again or 24% someday. It's harder for us to forecast. Ali Faghri : Got it. That makes sense. And then as a follow-up, a similar question on the towing cost side. Are you seeing any normalization there yet? I know diesel prices have come lower recently, and I know that's at least one input. Curious what you're seeing on towing costs more recently. Jeff Liaw : I think that's a reasonable observation that the fuel is a part of it, diesel is a part of it. Gasoline prices have softened very meaningfully from the peaks near the beginning of the war. Diesel has moderated less than conventional gasoline but also has moderated as well. So that will ultimately be realized in the form of our towing costs. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for any closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter call, and we'll talk to you after the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Gavin Renfrew, Vice President of Global Accounting of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Gavin Renfrew : Thank you, and good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with the corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to our co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Gavin. Good morning and welcome everybody to our first quarter call. We're pleased to report strong results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 in the context of a complex global economic backdrop and a significant weather event will describe in more detail today. Many of the unusual conditions that we've described on our previous calls persist today, though with some apparent stabilization, including new vehicle shipments shortages, high used car prices in a broadly inflationary environment. Gavin and I will provide our customary data points throughout our call on these themes and others, but I wanted to start by highlighting our recently published inaugural ESG report. If you haven't read it already, I'd encourage you to do so. In that report, we address the topic of sustainability across a number of different dimensions, environmental sustainability, global economic empowerment, enterprise sustainability, and community sustainability and recovery. Events of the past few weeks have in particular underscored our commitment to the fourth of these pillars. But I'll take a moment to briefly summarize the first three. On the first of these subjects, environmental sustainability. Copart is a keystone enabler of the circular economy. Our business enables the reuse and recycling of vehicles, their components and materials substantially reducing what would otherwise be the carbon footprint of the transportation sector. In fact, upon tabulating our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as the carbon emissions that are averted by our marketplace, we estimate that we save a hundred times as much in carbon dioxide equivalents as we emit in our business. On the second aspect of sustainability, global economic empowerment. Our business is instrumental in improving access to mobility for residents of developing economies. In fiscal 2022 alone, we sold vehicles to members in 160 countries with approximately one quarter of our volume purchased by members in emerging economies as defined by the United Nations. While those of us on this phone call today, like we take physical mobility for granted, it is undoubtedly a critical enabler for access to education, healthcare, economic advancement, and leisure worldwide. And we're proud to play an important role in increasing its availability for people around the world. On the subject of enterprise sustainability, we make strategic decisions with a 20-year horizon. As a result, we own the vast majority of our real estate, ensuring its availability for our business and our customers for generations. We maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure that we have the flexibility to invest in our business and our customers' success regardless of economic conditions at the time. And finally, we are committed to our role in ensuring the sustainability and health of the communities we serve, most notably in our rapid response to major weather events. In late September of this year, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida. On a unit volume basis, Ian will be the single largest storm event in Copart's 40-year history. This category for storm included heavy rainfall and winds in excess of 150 miles per hour and cut a path through the heart of the state. Ian proved to be a storm of historic proportions. The robustness of our response was the fruit of seeds we've been planting for years. As you've heard us articulate at length on prior calls in anticipation of increasing storm frequency and severity, we've made proactive investments in land, technology, heavy equipment, trucks, drivers, and personnel in the form of our dedicated cat response team. In this instance, of course, our investments paid off perhaps in economic efficiency, yes, but most importantly, in substantially enhancing the service we can provide our clients and their customers in their most acute times of need. We deployed more than 800 Copart employees from around the country to the affected areas, many while the hurricane still lingered over the state. In just the first 10 days of the event, we retrieved over 15,000 units and unprecedented efforts enabled both by our third-party subhauler network, as well as our company owned tow trucks, transporters, loaders, and Copart employed drivers. From the first day of this event, we leveraged nearly 350 acres of Copart owned dedicated cat only storage capacity within the affected region, allowing us to quickly receive an inventory, nearly 70,000 units through the end of the quarter. In turn, expediting the settlement process for policyholders who are eager for economic relief. To put our catastrophic storage capacity in context, the 1,500 acres of land that we own for the purpose of catastrophic storage alone represents as much land as another major provider of insurance auction services owns in total. As we've noted following major storms in the past, we view our pre-storm preparations and our robust response as investments in the strong and durable partnerships we enjoy with our insurance sellers. We tend to experience operating losses in major weather events. Hurricane Ian in the first quarter is no exception with $25 million in extra cost incurred by our business, offset by $9 million of revenue in the period. Our elevated cat related expenses include premiums paid for towing and transport, logistics, travel and lodging, and increased overtime and labor expenses for our team. As such, in the quarter, the impact of Hurricane Ian was approximately 200 to 250 basis points of gross and operating margin rate compression. Finally, in November we completed a two for one stock split, our six such split since 1999. We view this split as an opportunity to improve the liquidity of our stock, making it more accessible to our employees and retail investors. And with that, I'll turn it over to our VP of Global Accounting, Gavin Renfrew, to walk through some key operating and industry statistics and our fourth quarter financial results. Gavin Renfrew : Thank you, Jeff and good morning. I will start with the key statistics that we provide each quarter. Global unit sales increased 1.9% year-on-year for the quarter with US increase of 1.3% and international increase of 5.5%. Excluding catastrophic events from both periods last year and this year for the first quarter, US unit sales grew by 1.9%. Insurance business grew relative to one and two-year comparison due to share gains and the continued recovery and driving activity and accident frequency and severity. Notably, record high used vehicle prices have for the past several quarters negatively impacted total loss frequency and have tempered overall insurance volume growth. For the first time in nearly two years, we've observed a small sequential increase in total loss frequency of 20 basis points, while auction returns remain near all time highs and the ASPs continue to outpace the strong used car price environments on a percentage basis. Elevated used vehicle values and therefore, insurance ACVs continue to reduce total loss volume relative to what it would otherwise be. Though up slightly sequentially, total loss frequency for the third calendar quarter in 2022 was down year-on-year, falling by 220 basis points versus the same period in 2021. If vehicles were totaled at the same rate as in prior years, we would've observed industry total loss volumes 10% to 15% higher. While total loss frequency has declined over the course of the last two years, we still believe this to be a relatively short-term scenario. We appear to be observing some stabilization in total loss frequency based on the past two sequential quarters. Regardless, it is our view that the market will inevitably revert to its 40-year historical norm of steadily rising total loss frequency. Accident severity, repair complexity, and duration repair labor costs and rental car costs will contribute to said reversion boys by Copart's best-in-class auction liquidity and global buyer base as we continue with significant resource investment into member recruitment, registration, retention, et cetera. While supply chain bottlenecks persist today, we do anticipate that the eventual unwinding of these conditions will lead to a moderation of used vehicle values, ultimately trending back to lower levels in the future. We appear to be experiencing a moderation of these forces now with Manheim's used vehicle index now at its lowest points since August, 2021. A decline in wholesale auction values may cause reduction in our ASPs, but would almost certainly coincide with offsetting volume increases as well. We anticipate that lower ACBs and increased vehicle availability will inevitably reverse the observed short-term total loss frequency and volume trend previously noted. While overall, US non-insurance unit volume is relatively flat up approximately 0.2% in the quarter, excluding lower value cards from sources such as wholesalers and charities, we believe we are substantially outperforming other wholesale auction channels, both physical and digital.  Next onto our financial results. For the first quarter, global revenue increased $83.2 million or 10.3%, including a $23.6 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased $59 million or 8.8% for the first quarter, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. US service revenue grew 10.3% for the quarter, and international experience decrease of 2.4%. We saw continued strength in ASPs, which grew 5% year-over-year for the quarter with US ASPs up 6.4%. The Manheim indexes declined from the January record levels, but remains historically elevated ending October at 200, a decrease of 10.6% year-over-year. Purchased vehicles continued to comprise an increasing percentage of our overall revenue mix, driven by both strong used car values and growth and volume, particularly in our cash for cars business in the US and from international expansion. Purchased vehicle sales for the first quarter increased $24.2 million or 17%, with US purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter up 10.8% and international up by 27% for the quarter. Purchased vehicle cost of sales grew $24.7 million or 19.5% in the first quarter. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profits decreased slightly by $0.5 million or 3.1% during the quarter. Global gross profits in the first quarter decreased by $15.5 million or 4%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 600 basis points to 41.4%. US margins decreased from 50.3% to 44.1% and international margins decreased from 33.1% to 27.2%. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily attributable to two factors. 200 to 250 basis points of the quarter decline was due to elevated Hurricane Ian costs being directly expensed in the quarter. The balance of our margin contraction is attributable to a mixed shift to purchase vehicles. A modest reduction in purchase vehicle margins and cost inflation in both towing and labor offset partially by higher revenue per unit and volume growth. However, we believe we can continue to increase margin and returns on capital over time as we benefit from scale and find further operational efficiencies through technology and innovation. I will now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. G&A spend in the quarter increased $3.4 million or 8.3%. While G&A can be volatile from period to period over the longer term, we anticipate G&A to decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business and create additional leverage. Our GAAP operating income decreased by 5.6% from $330.1 million to $311.5 million for the first quarter, including a $4.1 million headwind due to currency. Excluding catastrophic events from both periods, operating income decreased by 3.3%. First quarter income tax expense was $67.3 million, it takes 21.5% effective tax rate. Adjusting for the tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would've been 21.7%. First quarter GAAP net income decreased 5.6% from $260.4 million last year to $245.8 million this year. Adjusted to remove the items detailed in our pro forma reconciliation included in our press release, non-GAAP net income decreased 4.7% from $257.4 million last year to $245.2 million in the first quarter of FY 2023. Our global inventory at the end of October decreased 3.6% from last year and was flat when excluding low value units like wholesalers and charities. That is comprised of a year-over-year decrease of 6.3% for US inventory, down 2.6% when excluding low value units and an increase of 17.1% for international inventory. For the first time in recent history, the number of total losses as a percentage of overall accidents has been declining. As a result, our inventory levels are lower than they were a year ago, despite incremental inventory attributable to unsold vehicles picked up during the quarter from Hurricane Ian. Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of October 31st, 2022, we had $2.8 billion [ph] of liquidity comprised of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter, decreased by $1 million year-over-year to $311.6 million driven by lower earnings due to the additional expenses incurred in the quarter from Hurricane Ian. We invested $152.7 million in capital expenditures in the quarter with over 80% of this amount attributable to capacity expansion as we are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure. Despite unusual near-term forces that have suppressed unit sales relative to where they would've been, we continue to invest in capacity with the conviction that we and our customers will need it. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are happy to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Labick : Good morning and congratulations on strong operating performance. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Good morning. Bob Labick : I wanted to start -- two quick questions related to the hurricane and thanks for all the around it as well. Just we're just trying to get a sense of the sequential costs, maybe unit costs excluding the hurricane impact in the quarter. How are you seeing changes in towing, fuel, labor, et cetera? It's, obviously, been elevated and rising. Has it begun to flatten out? Is it declining? Is it still rising? Just trying to get a sense of the trends of the cost to process a unit given the noise of the hurricane. Jeff Liaw : Yeah. And so, excluding the hurricane, Bob, I think in broad terms, certainly costs are elevated relative to a year ago. I think your question specifically on sequential trends, I think we're seeing stabilization in many cases. Of course, gasoline is an easily trackable proxy for some of those underlying costs. Diesel prices remain elevated, certainly relative to a conventional gasoline. But broadly speaking, we've seen stabilization in those underlying variables. Bob Labick : Okay. Great. And then you gave us some stats here too, and we know you've spent -- I don't know, I'll estimate hundreds of millions of dollars on incremental land in the last even few years, and a lot of that for cats. And given the greater severity of hurricane forecast and whatnot, how do you feel about your current capacity? Are there expectations to continue to add more land, or where do you stand in that regard? Jeff Liaw : Yes. So, we are -- we expect to continue investing in land very substantially, both for day to day operations as well as for catastrophic readiness. You've seen that quote elevated investment profile since the spring of 2016. And we continue to aggressively pursue land to support -- to support our core business as well as to address the spikes that, of course, occur in the context of catastrophic events. Bob Labick : Okay. Great. One more for me, I'll jump back in queue. Jeff Liaw : Yeah. Bob Labick : Just switching over to Germany. Could you just give us an update on volumes, quantitatively are they growing? When did they become meaningful? And then, also related to Germany, is that site integrated into the kind of US website? Meaning can international buyers that buy on the US site also seamlessly bid on cars in Germany and can alerts on cars they may like? Or is that potentially a future opportunity? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Fair question and I'll take a step back and generalize more broadly in Western Europe period. So, , Germany and Spain together, and I'll leave Finland aside, but Finland has an insurance and total loss model that looks a lot more like the US and Canada and the UK. So a gross settlement model. In Spain and in Germany, we continue to grow our volume with insurance sellers very significantly on a year-over-year basis, and certainly a multi-year basis as well. So, the progress is strong. We have traction with a number of different insurance carriers. As we've noted on prior calls, the ultimate objective is to secure nationwide agreements and to default to a gross settlement model across all policyholders in those markets. We continue to advance the ball in that regard. On your question of member crossover and such, we do have crossover marketing efforts. It is perhaps some day an opportunity to consolidate the entire auction platform into one today. The German auctions and even, frankly, yard by yard auctions in the US are still distinct online events. The member bases have overlapped. In some cases, meaningful overlap. There are separate registration and participation channels. Bob Labick : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my questions as well. I wanted to follow up on Hurricane Ian. I believe you mentioned 70,000 assignments through the end of October. Do you think that will be the total, or could there be more on the way? Jeff Liaw : More, but modestly so. Craig Kennison : Got it. And then I know in the past, sometimes you take losses overall on catastrophes when they're particularly expensive, like something like this. Is that the expectation this time around? Or could you see kind of revenue offset costs in the coming quarters such that this would be closer to breakeven? Jeff Liaw : A fair question, Craig. I think, in the aggregate, so if you were to take a truly bird's eye view of the catastrophic events, certainly taking into account the many millions, likely hundreds of millions of capital we've deployed to build the catastrophic facilities to buy the equipment, the trucks, the transporters, the loaders and to train and employ the people, and the technology, specifically for cat that we've also developed as well. In the aggregate, by the time you consider those costs, the catastrophic events are surely not a profitable endeavor for us, but a necessary one. We don't root for catastrophic weather events, but we do believe that they draw the contrast still greater between us and others in the industry in terms of our capabilities in those times of stress. So, in the aggregates, no, they are not profitable events for us. Craig Kennison : Thank you. And then trying -- we are trying to understand the impact of ASPs as they are correlated with the Manheim Index and used car values. Is there any data you can share with us with respect to ASPs maybe in the month of November, just to get a feel for what the year-over-year declines might look like as it relates to your model? Jeff Liaw : You'll find we don't, as you know, comment intra-quarter about the current quarter. But I would say that through the end of the first quarter, ASPs were still up in somewhat meaningfully year-over-year. 5% of the number, if I have the number correct off the top of my head here. So, ASPs were rising year-over-year. Manheim certainly down over that same period, so we are correlated. There are some leads and lags and so you'll never see a perfect regression there between us and other such third-party variables. But the market, broadly speaking, I think we still observe vehicle shortages. If you wanted to go buy a new car today, you might not have your pick or if you did, it might not come for two or three or four months down the road. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And lastly, I wanted to ask about Europe and your appetite for land there. We've certainly got a strong US dollar today and you have an urgent need to land over the course of decades, I suppose. Would you be inclined to be more aggressive in Europe to acquire that land now that you've got momentum in business and you've got maybe an advantage on currency? Jeff Liaw : Not more so, meaning we have an appetite for meaningful land investments to support our major incumbent businesses in Europe as well as our growing businesses in Europe. The currency is, in near-term -- it's a nudge in that direction, but it's not a meaningful influence. We're buying this land for 10, 20 and 50-year use. So, variations of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% even, don't necessarily affect that calculus. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Craig. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is Patrick [indiscernible] on for Bret Jordan and thanks for taking our questions. If you could talk a little bit more about recent volume trends. Are there any signs of volumes picking up as volumes drop or any signs of recent market share gains? Jeff Liaw : On the volume question, and there are many different ways to slice this question into its component parts with our insurance sellers. As Gavin noted, in some meaningful detail, we are observing a literally once in a lifetime suppression of total loss frequency, which we believe will eventually abate and reverse very meaningfully. That, I think we would say, has stabilized. Driving activity has picked up. Depending on the country you're talking about, it's picked up a lot in Europe where the driving was more suppressed a year ago than it has been in the US. So driving frequency, times, accident frequency times, total loss frequency is plus or minus the volume equation plus the market share question that you posted a moment ago. So, in the aggregate, I think we're seeing stabilization on total loss frequency but still a year-over-year decline, and we're seeing an increase in driving frequency and accident certainly are picking up as well. On the question of market share, we aren't in a position. In general, we don't comment on individual accounts. If you look at long-term arc of history, I'd say we generally speaking have earned more market share over the years both in insurance and outside of insurance. So, in our non-insurance businesses in which we serve automotive dealers, rental car fleets, financial institutions, among others, we believe we continue to gain share relative to other providers in that space. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. And then how do you guys see the competitive landscape changing with the RBA deal with IIA? Are there any synergies that you guys see? Jeff Liaw : I'd say -- I'll generalize a half step here. We take our competition very seriously, and we view our competitors set expansively. So, in earning the right to sell vehicles on behalf of our clients, we compete against every other path those vehicles can take. So, whether it's hand selling, retailing, repairs and certainly consignment through other wholesale auction platforms, so we are constantly investing and innovating to deliver the highest possible returns so that we win more of those head-to-head comparison against the alternatives and to eclipse the rising standards we set for ourselves as well. But to address your question specifically about another provider of auction services in the insurance space, we don't think a change in corporate ownership particularly affects how each of us competes in the marketplace. So, whether they are controlled by private equity or an activist hedge fund or one corporate holding company or another, we think our stability as a founder led independent company represents a durable and distinctive competitive advantage. In practice, we manage our business with a long-term investment horizon, which in turn creates the accumulating advantage of owning our own land, our technology platform, building a global buyer base in our team. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Jeff Liaw : Specifically, of course, those questions are better posed to the buyer and seller of that specific transaction. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. Thanks guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from [indiscernible] with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. [Indiscernible] on for Ryan Brinkman. I just had a question on how you guys are looking at margin compression given declining used vehicle values commodities. And is there anything you can do with -- by -- like adjustment retention rate, change that affect that? Jeff Liaw : What rate? Unidentified Analyst : Your retention rate or anything you guys can do to like offset margin compression? Jeff Liaw : Do you mind just rephrasing that? I'm not sure I understand your question. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. So, given that used values -- used vehicle values are normalizing lower along with commodities like, is there anything you guys can do on your side by adjusting your retention rate to offset that? Or how are you guys looking at that going forward? Jeff Liaw : Retention rate? Got it. So, with -- as used vehicle prices soften, we will see -- we will eventually see perhaps a softening in the selling prices of our cars, which is a self margin dilutive. We will, at the same time, see an increase in volume because a big part of the suppression of total loss volume today is those high used vehicle prices. So, when we see that additional volume flow through the system, that is margin accretive. Beyond that, as for other actions we can take, we certainly have levers in the business available to us which we explore on a recurring basis, including deploying still more technology and automation and so forth in our business, among other things. I think you know we don't comment on our fee schedules and how we manage that long-term. But suffice it to say, the business delivers enough value to our members and sellers to ultimately recover and generate a good return on capital. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. Gotcha. And are there any data points that you guys are looking at that we should keep track of in terms of this that would help out? Jeff Liaw : In this, being used car prices? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. So, anything you guys are like particularly keeping eye on that we should also look at? Jeff Liaw : Probably nothing insightful. So, we track the Manheim used vehicle index and ADA. We track anecdotally what's happening in the auction space, broadly auto retailers and the like. So, nothing that's not broadly available in what we track. Unidentified Analyst : Gotcha. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ali Faghri with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question. Ali Faghri : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Was there anything different than your cat response that allows you to process these cars quicker than historically? I think with the storm in mid to late September, I guess I was surprised to see that you were already selling through this inventory in October. I think historically, it's taken at least 60 days, especially for cat events. Jeff Liaw : I think, it's an evolution of our capabilities, but we've invested over the years. But certainly, we have in recognition of rising frequency severity of these storms, have invested in that technology. We haven't gotten to the details of what that means. But in the technology platform, in processing titles, in receiving cars, in helping the insurance companies by absorbing much of the physical work that they used to do, there are many different individual levers pulled to collectively expedite the process on behalf of our sellers. Ali Faghri : Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up here on total loss rates. They were up modestly sequentially. Do you think we've hit the trough there on total loss rates, and we should now see them start to climb higher from here? Jeff Liaw : A difficult forecast, I'll leave because that -- underlying that then is your belief about used vehicle prices, in particular. The other forces, I think we've got a fair bit of conviction in, which is to say that the eventual rising tide is repair costs will rise and will continue to rise because of vehicle complexity. Every car that rolls off the line today is meaningfully more complex than one, five years ago, and probably one a year ago. I saw anecdotally a recent description of a Ford focus having 300 microprocessors in it and a Ford electric vehicle having 3,000 of them for example. And I think that will play itself out over the years and decades to come. So, those forces, I think, are well known. Repair costs will rise. International demand for Copart vehicles will rise. The near-term variable is what happens to the used car prices, and that forecast is difficult to make in isolation. It does appear to be softening somewhat. But as for how that will play out over the next six to 12 months, that's harder for us to say. Ali Faghri : Great. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Ali. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll hand the conference back to Jeff Liaw for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Jeff Liaw : Great. Thanks everyone, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart, Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Liaw, Co-CEO of Copart Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call and thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll actually start briefly with the Safe Harbor.  Good morning. During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations Web site and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with the corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance. In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I wanted to start today by introducing our new Chief Financial Officer, Leah Stearns, who will provide additional data and context in a few minutes as well. We're very excited to have her join the leadership team here at Copart after an expansive search. We hired Leah for the richness and relevance of her prior experience, both at CBRE and American Tower, two industry leaders and public companies in their own right. She has experience with institutional customers, complex regulatory environments, real estate certainly as well, and brings exceptional analytical capabilities and leadership skills as well. So we're very quite excited to have her on board. I'll start my comments today starting with our customers. We aspire to be a customer-centric organization first and foremost. And I'll start with our insurance business. Our insurance customers certainly have experienced the rapidly changing industry environment now for three years with remote work volatility and driving patterns and across the board cost inflation. They've made a number of business process and personnel adaptations that in many cases have proven more durable than they\u2019ve initially expected and now we think may persist forever. We have likewise adapted our business processes to help them navigate this environment, including providing more virtual inspection, loan payoff and title services and the like.  For the quarter in terms of unit volume, we achieved U.S. insurance volume growth of 9% year-over-year, in large part attributable to the sell-through of volume from Hurricane Ian. The single most unexpected change as most of you know for our insurance customers has been the suspension and reversal of the rising total loss frequency trend that we had experienced almost completely uninterrupted for the past 40 years. According to CCC, total loss frequency increased from 17.4% in the third calendar quarter of 2022 to 19.7% in the fourth quarter. We think approximately half of this increase was attributable to flood vehicles from Hurricane Ian. Today, as has nearly always been true, total loss frequency is rising due to a combination of two forces. First, repairs are more expensive and less attractive due to increasing accident severity, vehicle complexity, labor costs and rental car costs. And secondly, salvage economics are more attractive because the fastest growing economies in the world in Central and South America, Africa and Eastern Europe lean on our damaged vehicles to provide the mobility they need. We've discussed on prior calls what would happen if and when used vehicle prices were to decline. And we've said that we think our selling prices may compress somewhat, but would be offset by increasing volume. We're seeing the beginnings of that phenomenon unfold today. In our second fiscal quarter, if total loss frequency had been at historical levels, we think our insurance volumes sold would have been 10% to 20% higher than it was. Now turning our attention to the non-insurance space. We've made a proactive effort to grow our business in the bank and finance fleet and rental car segments, a group we collectively call Blu Car. Blu Car volume for the quarter and the first half of the year has grown approximately 20% versus the prior year, despite a still supply constrained environment. We believe we've outperformed the overall wholesale vehicle auction industry. The technology and service offerings required to support these customers is different, and we've invested meaningfully in our capabilities to enable us to serve these sellers and our auction returns have enabled us to grow with them. Finally, I wanted to mention our members. In a supply constrained inflationary environment, our buyers have certainly seen Copart as a valuable source of increasingly newer, lower damaged and whole cars. And we've noted often that the fastest growing economies in the world generally have the fewest vehicles per capita. We invest significantly in our staff, in traditional and digital marketing and in our global lounge network to expand our member base. We remain committed to empowering more buyers driving auction returns, which in turn enables our sellers to consign still more vehicles through us. In closing, I wanted to note the bedrock principles that have guided us and are the foundation of our success. These principles certainly long predate both Leah and me, and there's nothing particularly magical about them. We continue to make decisions for the 30-year prosperity of our customers and our shareholders. We will invest in the technology of today and tomorrow to enable us to serve both our members and our sellers.  We will invest to recruit members to engage them and to expand the marketplace of services available to them to continue to expand the buyer universe. For every vehicle we sell, we are committed to finding the highest and best use of that vehicle anywhere in the world. And finally, we will invest in land. We will own our land whenever possible to ensure that our ability to serve our customers is never compromised by the wins or economic optimizations of third party landlords. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Leah Stearns, to provide some additional commentary and data and to walk through some key statistics. And then we'll turn it over or open it up for Q&A. Leah Stearns : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to join Copart. For me, the opportunity was compelling for a number of reasons, including the collaborative and entrepreneurial culture, Copart's enduring focus on delivering best-in-class service to our customers, the business' natural position at the center of the circular economy in automotive, as well as our solid financial foundation. I believe that with these factors, Copart is positioned to deliver exceptional results for our customers and create enduring value for our shareholders over the long term. And I couldn't be more energized to help drive these objectives forward. Turning to the quarter. Global unit sales increased 4.7% year-over-year, including an increase of nearly 4% in the U.S. and over 10% internationally. In the U.S., our fee units grew about 5%, primarily due to growth across our insurance business and our purchased units declined 23%. Internationally, our unit growth came from a mix of fee and purchased units, which increased nearly 9% and over 23%, respectively. During the quarter, our U.S. insurance business grew relative to its one and two-year comp of 9% and 35%, respectively. This was primarily due to the continued recovery in driving activity, increasing accident frequency and severity, total loss frequency and share gains. Our auction returns remain strong as we continue to invest in growing our global buyer base by driving member recruitment, registration and retention. As a result, Copart auctions provide our insurance customers with best-in-class liquidity and returns, ultimately providing a more cost-effective way to manage growing claims costs by making it a more cost-effective way to deem vehicles a total loss. Turning to our financial results. For the second quarter, global revenue increased $89 million or just over 10%, including a nearly 2% or $15 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased 79 million or over 11% for the second quarter, primarily due to a higher average revenue per unit and increased volume. U.S. and international service revenue grew nearly 12% and 5%, respectively, for the quarter. ASPs were flat year-over-year for the quarter, with U.S. ASPs up nearly 1% compared to a nearly 13% decline in the Manheim Index ending January at 224.8. Purchased vehicle sales for the quarter increased $11 million or nearly 7%, with U.S. purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter down 15% and international up 42% for the quarter. Our reduced purchased unit activity in the U.S. during the quarter was a result of a proactive approach to mitigate our principal unit exposure in a softening vehicle pricing environment. We continue to believe that this portion of our business provides an opportunity for future growth and is an important enabler for us in new adjacent asset classes and geographies. Purchased vehicle cost of sales grew more than 14 million or 10% in the second quarter. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit decreased by 4 million or approximately 24% during the quarter. Global gross profit in the second quarter increased by more than 23 million or 5.7% while our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 200 basis points to 44.6%. U.S. margins decreased to 48.9% and international margins decreased to 24.3%. The year-over-year margin decline on a consolidated basis was driven primarily by cost inflation and towing and labor of about 200 to 250 basis points. Over the last two years, our direct costs have seen pressures from inflation, primarily related to labor and fuel. We will continue to manage these costs with a long-term perspective. We view the increase in labor costs as a direct investment in our people, which will translate into best-in-class service for our customers. We constantly seek to optimize our operational processes through technology and automation. Finally, we are committed to investing in our real estate, logistics and technology assets to ensure we are positioned to scale appropriately to meet the demand of our customers. We believe with this approach, we can increase margins and returns on capital over time. Turning to general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation. G&A spend in the quarter increased $5 million or 12%. While G&A can be volatile from period to period, over the longer term we anticipate G&A to decline as a percentage of revenue, as we benefit from the scale of our corporate infrastructure. As a result of our strong revenue growth, offset by the cost increases experienced in our business, our GAAP operating income increased by more than 5% to 366 million for the second quarter. Our second quarter income tax expense was 83 million, which reflects a 22.1% effective tax rate. And finally, second quarter GAAP net income increased about 2% to 294 million or $0.61 per diluted common share. Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1% from last year. And when excluding low value units like wholesalers and charities, global inventory increased by 1%. That is compromised of a year-over-year decrease of 3% for U.S. inventory, which is actually down less than 1% when excluding low value units and an increase of 12% for our international inventory. Turning to our liquidity and financial position. We remain in a solid position with respect to liquidity, which stands at 2.9 billion as of the end of the quarter, which is comprised of 1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over 1.2 billion.  Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flow of 500 million which is an increase of nearly 12% from the prior year period. In addition, we have invested nearly 257 million in capital expenditures with over 80% of this amount attributable to our physical infrastructure, primarily capacity expansion. Finally, year-to-date, if you take our operating cash flow less CapEx, we've generated more than 243 million of free cash flow. Given the strong financial position, we intend on continuing to invest in our business to meet our customers' needs. These investments include yard expansion, new yard acquisition, our logistics and technology platform. We believe that these types of historical investments have differentiated Copart as a service provider, while ensuring that we have the capacity necessary to serve our industry's future growth. With that, I've concluded my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call over to Maria, and we're happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Stefanos Crist : Good morning. This is Stefanos Crist calling in for Bob. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff Liaw : Good morning. Stefanos Crist : You touched on this during the call, but could you provide a little more detail on the cost structure of the yards, how it's changed since pre-COVID and maybe how much of those changes are permanent versus temporary? Leah Stearns : Sure. I can take that one. In terms of our yard expenses, the majority of that cost comes from our labor as well as the costs associated with our sub haul and towing. So as we think about how those costs are either permanent or temporarily impacted as a result of the overall economic environment post COVID, labor costs certainly have increased and we don't expect those to abate, although we do focus on technology investments, which will over time make us more efficient in our processes and hopefully help to mitigate future growth on that line item. And from a sub haul perspective, a portion of that is directly attributable to fuel costs, and that is certainly something that we do see fluctuate. So that could be more of a temporary phenomenon. And those really account for the majority of the increase that we've seen from a yard ops expense over the last couple of years. Stefanos Crist : That's great. Thank you. Just a follow up. Can you just talk about what Copart's sweet spot is for non-salvage cars in terms of age and miles driven, and if you see that evolving any direction over the next five years? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think it's fair to say it has evolved and very steadily so since the company's inception. So if you look at the cars, if somehow there was a website in 1982 and you could see all the cars we had for sale, they would look markedly different from the cars that were available five years later, five years later, five years later and so on. So over time, the sweet spot for us has expanded. And today, I think it's safe to say it includes vehicles you would customarily see at dealerships and so forth that are very much whole cars that are drivable off the lot. So I think that sweet spot does move and shift over time. So I think we'll expect the continued expansion. It's not a static view, right? It definitely expands progressively over time. Stefanos Crist : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations Leah. I had a housekeeping question first. Just what was the U.S. insurance volume growth ex-Ian? Jeff Liaw : Approximately flat or thereabout -- flat or thereabout, Craig. Craig Kennison : I think you mentioned Ian was 70,000 cars, but did you get more cars post the quarter last time? Jeff Liaw : In terms -- post this quarter you mean? Craig Kennison : Post your last conference call when you said you had about 70,000 car assignments. Jeff Liaw : A few more. But that was the strong majority of it. Craig Kennison : Perfect. And then sort of a big picture question for you on AI making headlines across many industries. I'm just curious in your world, how you see AI impacting Copart since you guys like to think in decades? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think we are certainly following it closely and think that AI will be deployed -- well, in some respects, if you're viewing the AI and machine learning all collectively as the future of technology and neural computing and so forth. We do deploy some of those tools in our systems today, most notably for our vehicle valuation guide ProQuote, which helps insurance carriers make the optimal real-time decisions about total losses, when and when not to total vehicles. But I think you're referring specifically to I think the notion of automated chat and so forth. And that is the evolution, of course, of where FAQs eventually go. You end up with smarter and more informed answers on some of the questions you most frequently get here at Copart. I'd say today, with our sellers and members, the questions are often nuanced enough, specific enough to individual circumstances, lots purchased and so forth that it's not a ready solution for us today, but we follow the space. Our tech teams certainly are avid students of the space as well. So if and when relevant for our business to deploy much more broadly, we will certainly do so. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I wanted to follow up on kind of what's the non -- can you maybe bifurcate the non-insurance a little bit further? If I heard you right, you said 20% what you've now defined as Copart Blu, which is a combination of your dealer consignment and the commercial channels. I assume your kind of historical legacy shared municipalities, it sounds like there's a bad actor being price there that might be offsetting some of that growth. Can you just give us a sense for like the bifurcation of the two would be the first question? Jeff Liaw : Directionally speaking, what we characterize as non-insurance includes those Blu Car sales, which are rental cars, banks and financial institutions fleets rent of our companies and the like. That's a meaningful portion of our non-insurance volume. Copart Dealer Services, we didn't talk about specifically today. That's also a sizable portion of our non-insurance business. They are also performing well and growing the business in a difficult and challenging environment. The other elements of our non-insurance business include Copart Direct, which is our cash for cars business in which we buy cars throughout different consumers and sell them at auction. Here at Copart, Leah mentioned that in her comments as well as one of the elements of our \u201cprincipal business\u201d that had proven very successful for us over the years, but we also want to be thoughtful about how aggressive we are buying cars in a volatile price environment. And then the portion you mentioned as well, which is the charities and wholesalers business relatively lower value vehicles, we have in some cases optimized our business to serve insurance companies, Blu Car, Copart Direct, Copart Dealer Services and the like and have foregone some of the volume in those lower value segments. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then just a bigger picture question. One of your closest peers that's having to merge with an auctioneer of heavy machinery, has this led you to rethink the opportunity at all for TAM expansion in your business? Do you think these businesses are synergistic? Is there a place for Copart in those types of end markets? Just kind of curious how you think about TAM expansion generally speaking? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it's a fair question, Chris. I don't think it's specifically the catalyst for us to consider it, but it's a topic we have wrestled with ourselves. And when evaluating our own strategy and our opportunities to expand into new arenas, we take stock first of our core strengths. We think we are -- we excel at managing high volume online auctions and recruiting the sellers and buyers for them. We think we excel at physical infrastructure, both the development of greenfield facilities and the acquisition of existing ones and then managing the physical logistics to and from those facilities of high volumes of physical equipment and high volumes of vehicles historically. And we -- the third national capability of ours that I characterize is our ability to navigate complex regulatory environments. We have 50 different DMVs in the U.S. alone as well as a number of other relative regulatory layers here and certainly worldwide tax and otherwise, we think we are uniquely equipped to address. And we've taken and looked at those capabilities and asked ourselves the question of where can we deploy those into adjacent spaces to grow the business over time, and have done so selectively and very conservatively as you know. We've expanded with our acquisition of NPA five and a half years ago or thereabouts into the Powersports arena. We today are expanding this Blu Car initiative into the whole car space as well. And frankly, within Yellow Iron [ph], as you just inquired, we already sell within Yellow Iron specialty equipment, trucks and trailers and the like in many hundreds of millions of dollars of that equipment every year without per se a dedicated effort to expand our business there. So it's something that we revisit on an ongoing basis. I think this transaction doesn't per se affect us negatively or positively in terms of our interest in the space. Chris Bottiglieri : Okay, very helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hi. Good morning, guys. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : On that quick discussion of that other company's transaction, the buyer is certainly making a pitch that there are services that could be offered in the salvage space that would sort of add another lever on the revenue side. Do you see that? Is there an opportunity? Obviously, if you're selling scrap cars to LKQ, they don't want them waxed first. But are there things you could be doing as you -- whether it's Blu or Dealer Services where you could attach ancillary services? Jeff Liaw : In short, I think the answer to that is yes. And yes, that there are additional services to be offered to both sides of the marketplace, and we are doing that today. And we haven't talked about them at great length on earnings calls. We find those more relevant in discussions with our sellers and our members themselves. And those services certainly include things like delivery, financing, title services and the like. And the buyers -- that universe is expanding real time. As you noted, if you went back 30 years ago and the buyers are largely dismantlers and so forth, they're not that interested in other services we have to offer waxing or otherwise. Today as the cars -- as we expand our universe into more drivable vehicles, lighter damaged cars, I think that becomes more relevant over time. I'd argue that we are the industry leaders in that regard in terms of the mix in that direction. And so that thesis is a bit more relevant for us than it is for anyone else who is loosely in our industry. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a quick question on that. On the supply side, which sellers most dependent upon you being the purchaser as opposed to an agent? Does that most impact -- obviously, Cars Direct is probably the most, but are Blu versus Dealer Services, are those sellers expecting you to own the car as opposed to just consigning? Jeff Liaw : No, they are not. The principal business is largely Copart Direct, in which we buy cars from consumers at some modest residual volume in the UK. I think you know that when we entered that business in 2007, probably four out of five cars or thereabouts was managed on a principal basis. Today, I think that's reversed and then some. So we are largely when you're looking at principal volume for Copart, you're talking about Copart Direct. Bret Jordan : And Germany is really not -- is Germany still mostly agent or --? Jeff Liaw : Germany does a mix of both, that's fair. In Germany, we are doing both. We're selling consignment cars on behalf of insurance companies and we are also buying cars both directly from consumers and on residual value platforms. Bret Jordan : So I guess does the temporary move away from or maybe cutting back on purchased vehicles impact Germany in the short term, or is it not meaningful enough to really move the needle? Jeff Liaw : No, that's principal. The principal car, the moderation of principal car volume is principally here in the U.S. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Joseph Enderlin with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Enderlin : Hi, guys. This is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff Liaw : No problem. Joseph Enderlin : So with total loss rate moving higher again this quarter and inventory bottlenecks improving, do you expect the industry to return to historically normal unit growth rates from here? Jeff Liaw : From here, yes. Precisely when, I think it's harder to forecast. That's a function of the variables we talked about, which is the value of used cars and therefore ACV or pre-accident value as the European call it, and what the car is worth before it's in an accident, what happens to repair costs and rental car costs and the like. So I think we have total conviction, the total loss frequency revert to historical levels and continue to grow from there. The precise trajectory from today until that point I think is more difficult to forecast. But this is an unabated 40 or 50-year trend with the exception of the past 18 to 24 months. And so I think we do believe that it will revert. Joseph Enderlin : That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow up, we wanted to ask about ASP trends during the quarter. Did we see ASPs decline and then increase along with Manheim, or was there a more consistent trend? Jeff Liaw : Do you mean within the quarter? Joseph Enderlin : Within the quarter, yes. Jeff Liaw : I don't even know we know offhand. I think the prices I think remained quite strong at Copart and have meaningfully outperformed at least the headline numbers we're aware of for the Manheim used vehicle value Index. I don't know that there was any meaningful intra-quarter volatility of cohort. Joseph Enderlin : Super helpful. Thank you, guys. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your question. Gary Prestopino : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just want to get a couple of statistics go over correctly. Units processed, Leah, were up 7% globally. Is that correct? Leah Stearns : Total units were up, yes, about 5%. Gary Prestopino : 5%, okay. And then getting back to ASPs, I didn't quite get what you said on ASPs as you went through all these numbers. What were ASPs up year-over-year and sequentially? Do you have that? Leah Stearns : Yes. So ASPs in total were basically flat year-over-year. And sequentially, they were down about 3%. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So we're starting to move down 3%. Okay. And then lastly, with total loss ratios, you said, Jeff, they were 19.7% in Q4? Jeff Liaw : Correct. Gary Prestopino : Versus 17.4, but a lot of that was flood vehicles, right, that led to that sequential increase? Jeff Liaw : Yes, we think half of that or thereabouts was flood related. And I should have noted that and I will now that there is some natural lag then between when cars are both deemed a total loss and when, of course, they are processed by companies like us, the title process loans paid off and the car is sold. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Just for comparative purposes, what were total losses, the ratios running in Q4 of '21? Do you have that handy? Jeff Liaw : We do. This is all straight from CCC here, but in the fourth quarter, 19.2 a year ago. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then is there -- with the non-insurance business that you're doing, it's always been kind of at about 19%, 20% percentage of vehicles. How much has that moved up over time as you've grown this business? Jeff Liaw : There's some seasonality to it. I think to be fair -- and so I would say it's between 18% to 25% just from memory going quarter-to-quarter. And it has grown over the very long term. But to be fair, over the past few years, we've grown our insurance business as well. So they've both grown. So we don't generally think in mixed terms. We think in terms of growing Blu Car, growing Copart Dealer Services, growing Copart Direct and the like. So that the mix number is not one we particularly focus on. Both have grown meaningfully, of course, over the past five years. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Gary. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thanks everybody for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Before turning call over to management, I will share Copart\u2019s statement on Safe Harbor and non-GAAP financial measures. During today's call, the company will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on its Investor Relations website and in its press release issued at approximately 3 :00 p.m. central time today. The company believes these non-GAAP measures together with corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in analyzing the company's results and assessing its business trends and performance. In addition, the company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including management's current views, with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more details on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's Co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to our quarterly earnings call. We're pleased to report good results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We take pride in being the most customer centric organization in our industry, so I'll orient my introductory comments today around our clients. Leah will follow thereafter with details on our financial results. We recently concluded our 23rd Annual Advisory Board meeting with our key insurance clients. In honor of our 40th anniversary as a company. We hosted this event in Northern California close to our headquarters from which we moved about 10-years ago, it was something of a homecoming for all of us. Every year, we gather in-person to solicit feedback from our clients about the opportunities and challenges they face, which in turn informs our service offerings, tech deployments and capital investment programs. I thought, I'd start with some of the key themes that emerged from those discussions this year. The insurance industry continues to experience radical change across a multitude of dimensions, including across the board inflation as reflected in their rising combined ratios. They and we are observing an apparent reversion to increasing total loss frequency trends. According to CCC, the total loss frequency bottomed at 17% or thereabouts in the second calendar quarter of 2022 and has subsequently rebounded to 19% in the first calendar quarter of 2023. The third consecutive sequential quarterly increase. We anticipate the vehicle prices will likely stabilize or softened faster than repair costs will, which will drive total loss frequency to pre-COVID levels and beyond. We see new vehicle prices as a leading indicator for the used vehicle market. Kelly Blue Book data in particular indicates that average retail transaction prices for new vehicles in March of 2023 were below MSRP for the first time in nearly two years. The long-term drivers of total loss frequency of course remain unchanged. First, repairs are more expensive and less attractive over time, due to increasing accident severity, vehicle complexity, labor costs and rental car costs. And two, salvage economics are more attractive, because the fastest growing economies in the world in Central and South America, Africa and Eastern Europe lean on our damaged vehicles to provide the mobility they need. Although our U.S. Insurance volumes increased 6% or so year-over-year, we estimate the total loss volumes remain suppressed when compared to historical total loss frequency norms. In the first calendar quarter of 2023 alone -- pardon me, in this past quarter alone, the total loss frequency had been at their pre-COVID levels. Our insurance volumes could have been 10% more than they were. Another theme that emerged is that our insurance clients continue to experience hiring and retention challenges for their own workforce, which we believe will have them leaning more heavily on trusted partners like us to provide additional services, including virtual inspection, loan payoff, title procurement services among others. Our client also expressed strong interest engaging with our image recognition tools and machine learning algorithms to enable better decision making and importantly faster decision making. For a vehicle that will ultimately be totaled, insurance companies often incur literally thousands of dollars in towing, storage, estimating tear down costs and appraiser labor, much of which could have been mitigated with streamlined decision making. Our meetings with our clients also underscore the importance of our global marketplace in providing superior salvage returns to the insurance industry. I'll turn next to our non-insurance business. For several quarters now, we've reported on our progress with our non-insurance customers particularly in the bank and finance fleet and rental segments, which we collectively call Blue Car. We drove ongoing growth in our third quarter of approximately 7% year-over-year, despite a still constrained supply base. Likewise, we grew our dealer volume by nearly 5% year-over-year as well. We view these additional customer segments as examples of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to add both mass and velocity to the flywheel of our auction marketplace. Last comment, we've fielded a number of questions already from some of our analysts and investors about our growing cash balance and I thought I'd address that question proactively here. I'll start with our longstanding position and follow with a more nuanced current view. Our evergreen position is that we take our responsibility as stewards of capital seriously and evaluate prospective investments with an owner's mindset, because we are owners from Willis Johnson, our founder to our near -- newest employees who elect to participate in our employee stock ownership program. We prioritize investing in our core business, land, and technology in particular. Secondly, we consider strategic extensions that leverage our key capabilities as is evident from our conservative M&A track record, these opportunities generally must meet a very high bar. And as we have done episodically, but various substantially over the years, we ultimately return excess cash flow to our investors and subject to how the tax code evolves generally in the form of share buybacks. Regarding where we stand specifically today, I do want to emphasize how the strength of our balance sheet empowers and differentiates Copart. In comparison to other participants in our industry, we do not prioritize interest payments, debt paydown, dividends or massive cost reduction initiatives. We can deploy our resources specifically our capital and our management bandwidth to prioritizing the long-term prosperity and satisfaction of our clients. Three simple examples. First, we can continue investing in our owned real estate portfolio, which provides strong durable protection against an inflationary environment and also ensures the sustainability of our service model for the next 50-years. Second, we can provide superior service to our clients and catastrophic events even when doing so requires substantial capital investments in technology, trucks, land and people. And third, we can invest in the tech platform and marketing resources that create and sustain our global buyer base. In short, we believe our long-term orientation is in itself a distinct competitive advantage. I'll turn it over to Leah. Leah Stearns : Thank you, Jeff. Turning to the quarter. Global unit sales [Technical Difficulty] primarily due to growth across our insurance business and our purchase units declined 21%. Internationally, our unit growth came from a mix of fee and purchased unit, which increased over 11% and 14% respectively. During the quarter, our U.S. Insurance business grew relative to its one and two year comps of 6% and 25% respectively. This was primarily due to the continued recovery in driving activity, increasing accident frequency and severity, total loss frequency and share gain. Our auction returns remain strong as we continue to invest in growing our global buyer base by driving member recruitment, registration and retention. As a result, Copart's auctions provide our insurance customers with best-in-class liquidity and returns, ultimately providing a more cost effective way to manage growing claims costs by making it more cost effective to deem damaged vehicles, a total loss. Turning to our financial results. For the third quarter, global revenue increased $82 million or nearly 9%, including a 1% or $11 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased $81 million or nearly 11% for the third quarter, primarily due to higher average revenue per unit and increased volumes. U.S. and international service revenue grew nearly 11% and 9% respectively for the quarter. ASPs were down slightly year-over-year with U.S. average sale prices is down about 1%, compared to over 4% decline in the Manheim index, which ended April at 230.8. Purchase vehicle sales for the third quarter increased $1 million or nearly 1% with U.S. purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter, down 27% and international up 49% for the quarter. During the quarter, our purchased unit activity in the U.S. remained low as we managed our principal unit exposure in a softening vehicle pricing environment. We continue to believe that this portion of our business provides an opportunity for our future growth and is an important enabler for us in new adjacent asset class and geographies. Purchase vehicle cost of sales grew more than $2 million or 1.4% in the third quarter. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit decreased by $1 million or approximately 8% during the quarter. Global gross profit in the third quarter increased by about $47 million or 11%, while our gross profit margin percentage increased by approximately 100 basis points to 47.3%. U.S. margins increased to 52.2% and international margin decreased to 25.5%. The year-over-year margin increase on a consolidated basis was driven primarily by vehicle mix shifts in the U.S. towards higher margin consignment units and was partially offset by inflationary impacts to labor and fuel costs and vehicle mix shifts internationally where we had a greater percentage of revenue coming from lower margin purchase units. As noted previously, over the last three years, we have seen pressures from inflation primarily across labor and transportation costs. More recently, we have observed some attenuation in these expenses, particularly around transportation, which was partially driven by reductions to the cost of diesel, which has experienced a 20% decline year-over-year. In addition, we are constantly seeking to optimize our operational processes by leveraging technology and automation, which we expect will drive efficiency across the organic and help mitigate longer term cost pressures. Finally, while we experienced increases in labor costs over the last 12 months, we have viewed a significant portion of this as a direct investment in our employees and as an investment to support best-in-class service for our customers. We believe we can continue to increase margins and return on capital over time as we pursue our consistent investment discipline, focusing on our real estate, logistics and technology assets to ensure we are positioned to scale appropriately to meet the demand of our customers. Turning to general and administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation. G&A spend in the quarter increased $2 million. I'd like to highlight that last year we mentioned a non-recurring legal expense in Q3 excluding the impact of this, G&A would have been up $9 million, while G&A can be volatile from period-to-period. The longer term trends show that we are benefiting from the scale of our corporate infrastructure. Its effect can be observed on the downward trend of our G&A as a percent of revenue, which was 5.1% in Q3. The combination of our strong revenue growth and moderate cost increases drove an increase in GAAP operating income by more than 12% to $419 million for the quarter. Third quarter income tax expense was $90 million, which reflects a 20% effective tax rate. Finally, third quarter GAAP net income increased about 26% to $350 million or $0.72 per diluted common share. Our global inventory at the end of April increased 4% from last year and when excluding low value units like wholesalers and charities, global inventory increased by 7%, that is comprised of a year-over-year increase of over 2% per U.S. inventory or 5% when excluding low value units and nearly 15% for international inventory. Turning to our liquidity and financial position. Our liquidity stood at $3.3 billion as of quarter end, which is comprised of $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and our capacity under our revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flow of $1 billion, which is an increase of over 16% from the prior year period. In addition, we have invested nearly $347 million in capital ministers with over 71% of this amount attributable to our physical infrastructure, primarily capacity expansion. Finally, year-to-date, if you take our operating cash flow less CapEx, we've generated nearly $660 million of free cash flow. Given our strong financial position, we intend on continuing to invest in our business for growth and to meet our customers' needs. These investments include yard expansion, new yard acquisition, logistics and our technology platform. And as Jeff outlined in detail, we believe that these types of historical investments have differentiated Copart as a service provider, while ensuring that we have the capacity necessary to serve our industry's future growth. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd be happy to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS. Please proceed with your question. Bob Labick : Good afternoon. Congratulations on another great quarter. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Bob Labick : I just wanted to start, you touched on this a little bit, but as you successfully keep expanding into whole car, particularly dealer and then the blue car, the commercial areas. Are there like new features or new products that you're focused on adding? And then is there an opportunity there via M&A? Or is this generally something -- generally build these things out organically and how are you thinking about those two things given the cash balance you've touched on and kind of the new a chase an area that you're rapidly expanding into? Are there opportunities for M&A or how are you thinking about it? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Appreciate the question, Bob. As for the cash balance, I'd separate that question. I think our -- we haven't been per se capital constrained in the sense that we've been effectively an unlevered company for a long time. So we've had financial wherewithal to acquire companies. And in fact, have done so, including the acquisition of MPA now five, almost six years ago. To expand into the power sports arena. We think our organic growth prospects are compelling and it does require investments on our part the form of technology serving a bank does have some nuance distinctions. There are nuance products and approaches we have to take with financial institutions that are different from what we do for our insurance clients. That's for sure. Ultimately though, the benefit to both is apparent, because the liquidity is enhanced for both parties and the buyer base just grows as a result. So I think we are investing organically on that front I think if the right acquisition opportunity were to present itself at a compelling valuation that enhances those capabilities and accelerates our growth we'd evaluate consider it. But we have to meet the same very high bar that we've always applied. Bob Labick : Okay, great. And then just kind of sticking with this expansion into whole car and whatnot. Are the blue car particular buyer base the same as your core buyers or are they different? And are you marketing to these new buyers or are they finding you? How are you kind of growing the buyer base, which I know obviously benefits everyone as you go, but how is it coming, is it organic? Are you getting them or are they coming to you? Jeff Liaw : Very much both. So I think we are at this point a well-known liquid marketplace. So folks come to us. But certainly, we proactively approach folks who may be aware of us, but think of us in one specific context and we informed that now of the newer and emerging portfolio vehicles available at Copart. So it is very much both. Bob Labick : Got it. Super. Okay. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Dan Imbro : Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Maybe to start, I want to follow-up on Bob's question. A little bit around customer acquisition, more focused on the international buyer, Jeff, for a couple of years, you've been talking about growing into these new markets and kind of growing this international buyer base. Curious from here, I mean, how much of the low hanging fruit on SEO has been captured? Maybe kind of what inning are we in? And then the deeper question there is I guess when you look at these new customers you brought in, in these new markets, like how deep are the moats that you've built to keep them on Copart's platform versus long-term the risk of competition coming in and maybe taking some of those customers? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Daniel, I think you mean our members and buyers specifically. And to them, there are, of course, other places to buy vehicles, including some of the other well-known auction platforms. Our liquidity, I think, has grown over time, we've become a more compelling platform for them to enroll in and to pursue vehicles than we were 10 years ago. The one correction or modification I'd make to your comments is it's the expansion into the international arena has not just been in the past couple of years. That's been a decade-long endeavor. It so happens that the evolving mix of vehicles driven in part by total -- rising total loss frequency, which means the cars are better and less damaged as well as our pursuit of cars from noninsurance sellers has naturally grown that buyer base. I'd say in terms of -- in the baseball analogy, we're in the first or second inning because the fastest-growing economies are still -- they will continue to outpace growth in Western Europe, the U.S., Japan, Canada, et cetera, the established economies where people have vehicles will increasingly provide those vehicles perhaps older, perhaps a damage perhaps neither to the economies that demand more mobility. Cars divided by population remains very high in the origin countries where we operate our auctions and remains very low in the destination countries that buy them. Daniel Imbro : That's helpful. And I think about maybe one follow-up on that. How capital-intensive is it to enter a new country? I know in some countries, you've done Copart lounges. I guess, like is there a big capital investment to doing this? Or what is the cost of growth as you continue on this journey if we're still early innings? Jeffrey Liaw : Yes. I draw a distinction there between expanding internationally in the sense that we are operating auctions in a new country. So now 16-years ago, if I have my date straight, we entered the U.K. and our investment there has been very capital intensive in the sense that we've had to acquire land and build systems and hire people and acquire loaders and trucks and so forth to serve that market. That is by its nature, capital-intensive, ultimately rewarding as well the capital intensive at the outset. As far as attracting new buyers and buyers from new countries, that is not per se capital-intensive. It does require meaningful investment in resources in the form of our internal bandwidth, it also requires spending on SEO and SEM and third-party expenditures of that sort, but not capital in the sense that you're describing it. Daniel Imbro : Great. That's super helpful. And I just squeeze one more in for Leah. You mentioned at the end there, the falling transportation cost. I think about maybe last year, that was a big headwind on the industry. As those prices come down, I'm curious how you guys' view that. Does that become a tailwind to gross margin? I know you've owned some of your own transportation, so maybe it's less directly flowing through. But how should we think about that impacting gross margins during the past quarter when we look at the service gross margin expansion? Leah Stearns : Yes, that definitely was a benefit on the sequential margin improvement. So I would continue to expect that as diesel prices remain low and then we get the benefit of some of our investments around our logistics and transportation capabilities that we would continue to see that be a benefit. Certainly, the labor and inflationary pressures on towing costs around labor availability. That was a big pressure about a year ago, so we're beginning to see the other elements of the cost of transportation come down, which is nice to see, and that should flow through from a margin perspective. Jeff Liaw : Daniel, broadly, I'd characterize transportation cost as having stabilized as opposed to reverted to anything resembling pre-COVID norms. And so the inflationary pressure, I think, is abating or stabilizing, but it certainly has not reverted. Dan Imbro : Appreciate all the color. And guys best of luck [Indiscernible]. Jeff Liaw : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And I appreciate the new conference call time to what it\u2019s worth. I appreciate the new conference call time for what it's worth. I wanted to dig into ASP, Leah. I think you said that ASP was down a little bit versus the Manheim Index down maybe 3%. Last quarter, if I recall, you were flat on ASP in the Manheim environment down 13%. I'm wondering why that gap closed, if it was a function of mix or another dynamic? Leah Stearns : Yes. No. So we saw ASPs down across the board at about 1.4%. In the U.S., that was down 1.1%. And that was compared to a 4% decline on the Manheim Index. And again, most of that is driven by mix. It's hard to obviously pinpoint the exact drivers of it. But I think what's important to appreciate is that we certainly have an evolving mix of vehicles that are coming through our auctions quarter-to-quarter, and there's a fairly static set of units that are being measured through that Manheim Index. So I do think there is less of a correlation today than what you've historically observed between those two. Craig Kennison : That's helpful. Thank you. And then a question on National Powersports Auction or NPA. Are you seeing an uptick in volume from repossessions in that powersports business? And then to what extent our new, I'll call it, captive marketplaces from Harley-Davidson or from Polaris impacting your volume opportunity? Jeff Liaw : I'd say in terms of the repo question, I think a modest increase, not yet step function changes in that regard. I think though vehicle values in powersports and light vehicles, in general, have softened. I think for the most part, loans remain in the money, though that trend can change over time as well. What was your next question -- the Harley question. The captive marketplace is not having per se affected us. I think the business continues to perform well, and the sources of bikes and other related powersports continues. Craig Kennison : Alright, thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. First one, I might kind of follow-up with your comment on the -- from your trade show that you did with the insurers. So I want to think there was the application of the several thousand dollars that are being spent on cars that are totaled anyway, not sure what percentage of time this happens, but it sounds like that's nearly half the proceeds. So I guess that the insurance companies did kind of use your advanced data to make decisions quicker. Like what would the impact on total loss rates be? Like what's the elasticity of getting 50% lower cost on relative to revenue, what would that mean? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it's a fair question, Chris. That was the multiple thousands of dollars is an illustration. I would say that the strong majority of cars that Copart sells on behalf of insurance companies have advanced charges on them in the many hundreds of dollars range, right? So it is serious money that the insurance companies are paying to towing companies, repair shops and frankly, their own employees as well to touch and see vehicles that arguably did not require any of that intervention. The cars could have been towed directly to Copart and been sold and have the title processed without anyone ever having touched it otherwise. So the economic opportunity there for our insurance companies is massive. And so we take it very seriously and are engaged with them on various initiatives to varying degrees in terms of their flexibility and ability to change the way they handle their own business processes. I would say that there is a long-standing industry bias, which I think is now evolving to repair cars, when possible, right? I think there's a long-held view that people grow attached to their vehicles, policyholders grow attached to their cars and want them back. And I think that line of thinking has changed a lot even over the course of the past eight years, and we think will change over the next 20 as well. And so the default repair mindset will change. As for your specific question about how it affects total loss frequency, the total loss economics would be still better if you could forgo all of that waste in the system. And could it, therefore, drive total loss frequency up, yes. In terms of the elasticity, I think quarter to comment on, except to say that the economics we're talking about here are very substantial. It is a good portion of the -- is a robust portion of the ultimate claims cost for a totaled car for an insurance company. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. And then I just want to ask about the used car pricing has been volatile more recently. I mean it seems like you got to hit this inflection point where total loss rates were starting to pick back up again as car prices softened. I think we went through like a multi-month period where car prices actually started to appreciate again, now we're depreciating. But what's the net of all that? Like do you think we've just kind of hit a trunk corner now with total loss rates kind of just keep sequentially building? Or is there any risk that you see as like a small air pocket just given the appreciation we saw? Jeff Liaw : I think to be fair, Chris, we don't know I don't think we don't make management operational decisions on month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter blips like that. I think the five year trend, I bet a lot of money that in five years, the total loss frequency rate will be meaningfully higher. But that's what happens in the next quarter or two or three. I think the volatility you cite is unprecedented in your career and mine in terms of what we observed over the past three years. So forecasting that and it's been derivative effects on our assignment volume, tough to do from where we sit. But I think we generally expect total loss frequency to rise over the next forever, but certainly over any appreciable horizon. Chris Bottiglieri : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : Quick question. I think you guys called out some of your services, including loan payoff. And just on the loan payoff product, I think your peer was having something that's sort of automated and integrated into the insurance and bank systems that didn't involve human interaction. Is that something that is the same as what you're offering? Or is that something you're developing that's automated? Jeff Liaw : In a word, yes, Bret. And I think the financial institution universe, as I think you appreciate, is very fragmented. So there are literally thousands of lenders who participate in auto lending, some of which are technologically advanced and some of which are tiny credit unions that no matter what you do, require faxes and phone calls and so forth to settle claims. I think we are at the forefront of the digital integration. And in fact, although others in the industry may have announced partnerships with certain integrators, we'd actually started with them, I think, six or nine months prior to even their engagement with Dealertrack, for example. So we have been at the forefront of obtaining the loan payoff balance, and we are at the forefront of servicing and paying that loan balance in the letters of guarantee and the other ancillary services and offerings that come with it. So I think as much as you can be, given the fragmented nature in highly varying degrees of technological sophistication among financial institutions. I'd say we're at the forefront of that. Bret Jordan : Great. And then a quick question on international. I think you saw 12% unit growth. Could you talk about what markets is Germany gaining traction? Is it the addition of Finland and Spain? Maybe give us some puts and takes on the international volumes. Jeff Liaw : Yes. I'd say without getting into the nitty-gritty, we're experiencing growth consistently across the countries, including our long-time incumbent markets like the U.K. and Brazil, for example, where we're experiencing growth due to both market trends as well as share capture and the like. And then in our emerging markets, so to speak, or our new -- more newly entered markets like Germany and Spain and Finland, we are experiencing growth. They are -- by their nature, still small enough that they don't affect the overall growth equation that much. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Healy : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the Blue Car opportunity. As you look at that business, do you see it running complementary kind of side by side with the legacy insurance business? Or do you run it as kind of one business? Just from a technology standpoint or just from a day of auction standpoint, like how are you thinking about the actual auction event with dealers engaging? And is there any sort of thought process about what the incremental spend in terms of technology or platforming that we might think about just kind of over the next few years? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Got it. I appreciate the question, John. And those are good questions. And as you might imagine, we do AD test to those specific notions. So are certain cars or certain products better off in their own stand-alone auctions virtually across the country or in a region or appended to the existing Copart auctions that are increasingly twice weekly at each of our facilities. So we test those things. And ultimately, we'll do what is best for returns. The question would be how we drive the superior economic outcomes for our sellers. So I don't think we have a definitive rule of thumb that it must be 1 giant auction or that it must be highly specialized. I would say we have examples of both. So our NPA auctions continue to operate on a stand-alone basis. Our big actions that, for example, our Grand Prairie Yard in Dallas continue to run, I think, twice weekly, big auctions that include most of the products product types that we might sell out of that facility. So we see both, and I think we could very well evolve over time. That's just a function of observed behavior and observe the outcomes. John Healy : Sure. No, that makes sense. And then just one kind of question on whole car as well. We're roughly 12 months out since the ADESA deal with Carvana closed I always thought of those guys as the big repo house in the auction world. Curious to know if you're seeing any, I don't know, RFP upticks or opportunities that could be sizable on that front? Because when I think about where everyone is going with their platforms in real estate, it seems like you guys might be in a position to have a high value-added mousetrap there? Jeff Liaw : No, pretty good question. I think we see opportunity to win the right to sell cars on behalf of financial institutions, including ones handled by ADESA and including cars handled by other folks as well. So perhaps not uniquely so, but of course, there is obviously some press, some noise in that specific circumstance that has given rise to discussions and conversations with prospective sellers. John Healy : Okay, thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your question. Gary Prestopino : Hey, Leah. Hey, Jeff. How are you doing. Hey I couldn't write this down fast enough, but Leah, did you say units were up 4% in the U.S. and 12% internationally? Leah Stearns : Yes. Units were up 4%, and they were up I believe, 7% excluding low value, and they were up 12% -- or 15% internationally. Sorry, 12% internationally. Gary Prestopino : Okay. 12% internationally. What -- on a combined basis, what were the units up? Leah Stearns : Sorry, can you repeat that, Gary? Gary Prestopino : On a combined basis between U.S. and international, what were the units up year-over-year? Leah Stearns : Combined was up 5%. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then, Jeff, in the meetings that you had with your insurance customers, was there any really new issues that kind of cropped up that insurance companies want you to maybe start addressing? Or is it still really decreased cycle times, increased salvage returns? I just want to get a feel for what they're thinking. Jeff Liaw : I think it's more evolutionary than not in the sense, Gary, that we talk to our customers literally every day. So there aren't going to be any new bombs dropped an event like that. But I think it's a nice opportunity to crystallize some of that thinking and to gather more consensus views on what the priorities are. And so for sure, cycle times, for sure, salvage returns. And I think as I noted in the introductory remarks, people pressure on their front that leads them to want to lay more of the work on Copart to have us perform more services for them. That's probably the biggest emerging theme we've seen over the past couple of years. So we have virtual inspection services that we've seen a very dramatic uptick in the adoption across many of our customers. Gary Prestopino : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Jeff Liaw to close. Jeff Liaw : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Leah Stearns : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before turning call over to management, I will share Copart's statement on Safe Harbor and non-GAAP financial measures. During today's call, the company will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including discrete income tax items, the effect of extinguished debt and adjustments to income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. The company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on its Investor Relations website and in its press release issued at approximately 3 :00 PM central time today. The company believes these non-GAAP measures together with the corresponding GAAP measures are relevant in analyzing the company's results and assessing its business trends and performance. In addition, the company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including management's current views, with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more details on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31st, 2023, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's Co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you, and good evening, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and the conclusion of a strong fiscal year. We continue our trend of generating excellent results for new and existing customers of growing our business profitably and of reinvesting in the future prosperity of our customers and ourselves. Today, I'll keep my comments brief focusing on some of the recurring themes that are most relevant to our business and to our customers. A year ago on this same call, we talked about the various dimensions of enterprise sustainability that we consider here at Copart, including environmental sustainability, given our critical role in the circular automotive economy. Our financial sustainability in the form of our conservative capitalization, operational sustainability through our land stewardship and ownership strategy and global socioeconomic sustainability and our providing mobility to developing economies around the world. Today, I'll spend just a few minutes elaborating on a fifth dimension, which is the proactive role Copart plays in assisting communities in their recovery from catastrophic weather events. The 2023 hurricane season has been forecast to be \"above normal\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the Department of Commerce. That forecast feels evergreen now year-to-year. So far in 2023, we've experienced 12 named storms, more than double the number we encountered last year. Thankfully, for our insurance clients and their policyholders, the insurance loss impacts of the first hurricane to make landfall this year, Hurricane Idalia, were relatively modest in comparison to major storms in prior years. The threat of a more substantial event nonetheless remains in 2023 as many of the most significant storms in the past 20 years have occurred late in the season. Hurricane Ian, for example, the largest ever catastrophic event in our history, as measured by unit volume, did not itself make landfall until the 23rd of September last year. For any substantial storm likely to affect our insurance clients and their policyholders, we don't have the luxury of perfect visibility before we deploy resources, both in the moment and in the years prior. Our response to Hurricane Idalia illustrates this reality. Though the landfall of the hurricanes eye was projected to be in the big band area of Florida, prevailing weather models showed a wide range of possible outcomes, including a potential initial landfall in the Tampa area and Eastwood progression thereafter through Florida, Georgia and Carolinas. Well before landfall, we deployed hundreds of team members, Copart-owned and third-party-owned tow trucks and Copart-owned loaders, telecommunications equipment and generators from around the country to the region. We were prepared to immediately retrieve inventory store process titles for and sell many thousands of vehicles in the affected areas. And of course, our real estate investment and planning had begun years in advance, yielding more than 600 available acres of dedicated cat storage in Florida alone. For a given storm quarter or year, our investments in catastrophic readiness may appear to be overkill, but we recognize the responsibility we have to our customers and to the communities we serve together to optimize our readiness for such severe weather events. I'll touch on a few additional themes for both our insurance and noninsurance businesses. But first on the -- in the insurance universe. According to CCC, total loss frequency troughed at 17.1% in the second calendar quarter of 2022 and has subsequently rebounded to 18.8% in the second calendar quarter of 2023. This is down a bit sequentially from calendar quarter one into calendar quarter two, though this is the result of seasonality. We've observed that same modest reduction in total loss frequency from the first quarter to the second quarter in each of the past eight years of CCC's data. Our expectation is the new and used vehicle prices are likely to stabilize or decrease in more swiftly than repair cost will. We believe this, in turn, should lead to a recovery in total loss frequency eventually surpassing pre-COVID levels as well. In March 2023, Kelley Blue Book data indicated that average retail transaction values for new vehicles were below MSRP for the first time in nearly two years. In April 2023, this average transaction price was nearly $400 below MSRP compared to being $600 above just one year prior. The long-term drivers of total loss frequency, of course, remain unchanged. First, repairs are more expensive and less attractive due to increasing accident severity, vehicle complexity, labor costs and rental car costs and two, salvage economics are more attractive because the growing economies in Central and South America, Africa and Eastern Europe depend on our damaged vehicles to provide the mobility they need. Although our insurance US insurance volumes continue to increase, up some 9% year-over-year, we estimate the total loss volumes continue to be relatively suppressed when compared to historical total loss frequency norms. As this inflationary environment persists, our insurance clients continue to experience hiring and retention challenges. And we, therefore, believe they'll lean still more heavily on trusted partners like Copart to provide additional services, including virtual inspection, loan payoff and title procurement services, among many others. Our insurance company clients continue to leverage and incorporate our image recognition tools and machine learning algorithms to enable better decision-making on total losses and importantly, faster decision-making. As we've noted in the past, for a vehicle that will ultimately be totaled, insurance companies often nevertheless incurred literally thousands of dollars in towing, storage estimating teardown costs and appraiser labor, much of which could have been mitigated with streamlined decision-making. Our insurance companies continue to benefit from and appreciate the importance of our global marketplace in providing superior salvage returns to the insurance industry and minimizing their claims expense as a result. Finally, a few comments on the noninsurance world as well. In the fourth quarter, we observed year-over-year growth of 13.8% in our Blue Car division, underscoring the realization of the benefits of our auction platform and our global member base as we serve the bank and finance fleet and rental segments as well. We likewise increased our dealer volume year-over-year by 5%. These dealers are unique as they serve, in some cases, as both sellers and buyers on our platform. In both cases, for the Blue Car and dealer sources of vehicles for Copart, we believe we are outperforming other wholesale channels for vehicles. Lastly, in July of 2023, we received approval from the competition authorities in the UK to complete the merger of our acquisition of Hills Motor Company, which we had -- which we had completed in financial terms a year ago prior. Hills Motor Company is a leading vehicle dismantling business in the UK, our insurance customers in the region have made clear to us that they prefer us to be partially -- to be partially vertically integrated in auction vehicles on their behalf while also directly satisfying some of their needs for recycled parts. With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Leah Stearns, to provide additional commentary, to walk through some key statistics in our fourth quarter financial results before we open it up for questions. Leah? Leah Stearns : Thank you, Jeff. Turning to the quarter. Global unit sales increased nearly 10% year-over-year, including an increase of almost 8% in the US and over 22% internationally. For the fiscal year 2023, global unit sales increased over 5%, including an increase of over 4% in the US and over 12% internationally. In the US, our fee units grew about 8% for the quarter and 5% for the year, primarily due to growth across insurance units. Our purchase units declined 3% for the quarter at about 14% for the year. Internationally, our unit growth came from a mix of fee and purchased units, but fee units increasing over 22% in the fourth quarter and over 11% for the year and purchased units increasing nearly 21% for the quarter and 20% for the year. Our US insurance business grew relative to its one and two-year comps of 9% and 19% during the quarter and 7% and 28% for the year, respectively. This is primarily due to the continued recovery in driving activity, increasing frequency -- accident frequency and severity and total loss frequency and share gain. Our auction returns remain strong as we continue to invest in growing our global buyer base by driving member recruitment, registration and activation. As a result, our auctions provide insurance customers with best-in-class liquidity and returns, ultimately providing a more cost-effective way to manage growing claims costs by making it more cost effective to damaged vehicles of the total loss. Turning to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, global revenue increased $114 million or nearly 13%, including a 1% or $6 million tailwind due to currency. For fiscal year '23, global revenue increased $369 million or over 10%, which includes a 1% or $44 million headwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased $126 million or nearly 18% for the fourth quarter and $345 million or 12% for the year, primarily due to higher average revenue per unit and increased volume. US service revenue grew by nearly 16% for the quarter and over 12% for the year, and international service revenue grew over 36% for the quarter and over 11% for the year. ASPs were up slightly year-over-year for the quarter, with U.S. average sales prices up about 2%, and that's compared to an over 11% decrease in the Manheim Index, which ended July at 211.7. Purchased vehicle sales for the fourth quarter decreased $12 million or 7%, with US purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter down 25% and international up 29% for the quarter. For fiscal year 2023, purchased vehicle sales increased $23 million or about 4%, with the US down 15% and international up about 37%. Purchased vehicle cost of sales decreased $12 million or 7.5% for the fourth quarter and purchased vehicle gross profit decreased by about 1%. For the fiscal year, purchased vehicle cost of sales increased $29 million or 5% and purchased vehicle gross profit decreased by $6 million or 9%. Global gross profit for the fourth quarter increased by $76 million or about 20%, and our gross margin percentage increased by approximately 270 basis points to 45.9%. US margins increased to 51.2% and international margins decreased to $21.4. Global gross profit in the fiscal year '23 increased by about $131 million or 8% and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 100 basis points to 44.9%. US margins for the year increased to 49.2% and international margins decreased to 24.5%. I'd like to note the decline in our international gross margin reflects approximately $6 million of prior period noncash expenses, which are primarily depreciation and amortization and the effect of marking our acquired inventory to fair market value, which was incurred due to our completion of the final purchase price accounting for Hills acquisition in the UK. The year-over-year margin increase on a consolidated run rate basis was primarily driven by a mix shift in the US, partially offset by inflationary impacts to labor and fuel costs and a slight decline in purchase unit margins internationally. On the cost front, our teams remain focused on optimizing our operational processes by leveraging technology and automation to mitigate the inflationary impacts we've experienced across our labor and transportation costs. In addition, we have recently observed some attenuation in certain expenses, particularly transportation, which was partially driven by reductions in the cost of diesel, which has experienced a 29% decline year-over-year. In addition, we are constantly seeking to optimize our operational processes by leveraging technology and automation, which we continue to expect will drive scalability and efficiency across the organization to continue to help mitigate longer-term cost pressures. Turning to general and administrative expenditures, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation expenses, G&A spend in the quarter increased $12 million and $23 million for the fiscal year, and G&A as a percentage of revenue was 5.6% in Q4 and 5.1% for the fiscal year 2023. Because of our strong revenue growth and moderate cost increase GAAP operating income increased by more than 20% to over $390 million for the quarter and about 8% to nearly $1.5 billion for the year. Fourth quarter income tax expense was nearly -- was near $72 million, which reflects an 18% effective tax rate. And for the year, income tax expense was nearly $317 million, which reflects effective tax rate of 20%. Finally, fourth quarter GAAP net income increased about 32% to almost $348 million or $0.36 per diluted common share, while GAAP net income for the year increased 13.5% to over $1.2 billion or $1.28 per diluted common share. Our global inventory at the end of July increased 9.5% from last year. And when excluding low-value units like wholesalers and charities, global inventory increased 11%. That is compromised with a year-over-year increase of over 8% for US inventory or over 10% when excluding low-value units and nearly 16% for international inventory. Turning to our liquidity and financial position. Liquidity stood at $3.6 billion as of year-end, which is comprised of $1.4 billion in investments and held-to-maturity securities, $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and our capacity under our revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. For the year, we have generated operating cash flow of nearly $1.4 billion, which is an increase of almost 16% from the prior year. And in addition, during 2023, we invested nearly $517 million in capital expenditures, with over 80% of this amount attributable to our physical infrastructure and more specifically, capacity expansion, which contributes to our ability to serve our customers, while simultaneously reducing our transportation costs and corresponding fuel consumption. Finally, year-to-date, if you take our operating cash flow less CapEx, we've generated over $847 million of free cash flow. Given the strong financial position, we intend to continue to invest in our business to meet our customers' needs. These investments include yard expansion, new yard acquisition, logistics and our technology platform. As Jeff outlined in detail, we believe that these types of historical investments have differentiated Copart as a service provider while ensuring that we have the capacity necessary to serve our industry's future growth. With that, we're concluding our prepared remarks, and we're happy to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bob Labick : Good afternoon. Congratulations on continued strong performance. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Bob Labick : First question, I have a related follow-up as well. But could you talk a little bit about the recent announcement of, I guess, a partnership with Hi Marley tech-enabled services in general to help your insurance customers? Maybe talk about what you'll do with that company and if there's other areas of interest where you might be partnering to help your insurance customers? Jeff Liaw : Sure. Happy to address that, Bob. So Hi Marley is a service provider in the insurance ecosystem broadly speaking. They started in the messaging space, in particular, but they're committed to improving workflow efficiency as well as the interface between policyholders and companies within the insurance industry. Well I think we share that objective to improve insurance outcomes, to streamline processes and automate them on behalf of all the participants in the industry, so we're delighted to partner with them. We see that they have achieved some traction with some of the leading carriers in the space, and we think that we can develop product offerings together that will achieve those outcomes, reduce cycle times, reduce waste, increased policyholder satisfaction in total loss scenarios. Bob Labick : Okay. Super. And then kind of as a related follow-up, we're increasingly seeing AI-based programs just using smartphones for enhanced inspections or valuations of autos, other damage or valuation of the car. Do you see this as an area that you're interested in investing in? And is this a buy, build or potential partnership opportunity for you? Jeff Liaw : I think it's likely a mix of the above. So we have developed and continue to refine our own image-based tools. And the more precise the exercise is certainly the more difficult the development challenge. But to assess a vehicle as a total loss, I think, for a healthy portion of them, the AI required is not best sophisticated, right, a car that has multiple airbags delivered, pardon me, deployed and they collided at 35 miles an hour that is five years old, it's highly probable to be a total loss, and the image recognition will only enhance the conviction of that call, where I think the image recognition becomes a more complicated endeavor is when there is slight damage and to estimate the actual repair cost and to try to forecast from deflection in a given panel, how much damage has been done to the underlying drivetrain or computing capabilities of the car, that's harder to do. But for the total loss application, we have a robust product ready to be deployed and deployed in some cases with insurance companies. But likewise, if there are other service providers that insurance companies prefer, we're happy to plug in with them as well. Ultimately, we share the same objective, maximum efficiency, maximum speed on behalf of our clients. If that happens through our natively developed products, great. If there is a product they prefer instead, that's great, too. Bob Labick : Okay. Super. Thanks for that. And then one last one, I'll jump back in queue. You kind of touched on this already, but just -- you mentioned obviously CapEx this year, $500 million, 80% for capacity additions essentially. Where do you stand in terms of your capacity and your yard efficiency based on the capacity in those yards? Obviously, you've had record volumes. You keep increasing that volume. And there's still a lot of room to run with total loss frequency, as you pointed out today as well. So just I know you're investing $400 million in the last year and tons and tons of capital. But how do you see the yards current efficiency? And where do you stand in terms of capacity that you want/need? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think it's a great question and tough to answer in a single paragraph in part because the answer varies very significantly by geography, by region, by city, even by areas in a given city. So as a blanket statement, we are certainly in a good place in terms of capacity and being able to serve our customers as they stand today. But we forecast 5 and 10 and 20 years at a time. And so very much still have the appetite for significantly more investments as well in land and capacity in part to support the growth that Bob you observed at the outset here. So we are -- if you were to look across our system, there's certainly pockets in which we know we need land relatively soon. There are other areas in which we know we are in good shape for 5, 6, 7, 10 years even, but I think we would expect to continue to deploy capital in support of our growth. If we look back now with the benefit of hindsight after 40-some years, the land we have bought is generally proven to be objectively a good financial investment regardless, which is not to say we would be wasteful or reckless about it. But in general, land itself is not consumption. It's investment in a durable asset that has proven to accumulate value as well over time. Bob Labick : Okay. Super. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Yeah, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff, I want to start on the demand side, maybe the equation. You mentioned these emerging markets need Copart to provide affordable transportation. I'm curious where else can those markets supply vehicles from at scale? There have been some headlines around maybe Asian manufacturers, especially China, exporting more cheap cars. But are you seeing any change in the need for those cars or the availability maybe from outside of your channel that you would compete with in the buyer side? Jeff Liaw : In a word, no, which is not to say that picture can't change in the years ahead. But the international demand and to be fair, there are countries that are -- they -- in the aggregate, international demand for cars from Copart has expanded very significantly on a one, 5, 10 year basis. For any individual country, the demand can be subject to economic volatility, inflation, unemployment, et cetera. But in the aggregate, the developing economies have seemingly perpetually growing appetite for our cars. Could that be satisfied by other providers, perhaps. But it seems that a high-grade US quality vehicle, UK, Canada, for that matter, that can be repaired is the better instrument to address that demand. And it has been -- at least that's been true for the past 20 years. I think we don't expect that to change. Daniel Imbro : Great. And then maybe more near term, looking at the quarter, Leah, I think you mentioned US vehicle sales maybe units were down a few percent, but there was a nice pickup sequentially in the service vehicles. Was that just a customer shifting maybe from principal to agency? And is that still something you see in your new markets? I'm curious, internationally, vehicle sales units were up a lot. Is that just the onboarding of customers that still want you to take principal risk, but the long-term strategy to convert them to agency? Jeff Liaw : So in terms of US purchased vehicle sales, we were actually up sequentially. But year-over-year, that was down slightly. So that does appear. And we do believe that the reduction in purchased vehicle sales earlier in 2023 was really a temporary phenomenon for the business. So we would expect to see that continue to grow going forward on a sequential basis as the market becomes more stable from an ASP perspective and more of the whole car space. And then as it relates to the second part of your question, can you repeat that? Daniel Imbro : Just internationally, that continues to grow very quickly. I'm curious if that is more of the long-term strategy? Or if that is a -- helping onboard new customers remove the risk from the seller, but ultimately shift them to agency is the strategy? Leah Stearns : It's really the latter initially. And to the extent that we find opportunities to continue to expand in international markets, we may use that. But I don't think you'll see us grow significantly on the international side, particularly for the insurance business. We may increase our full car cash for cars business internationally, but that is a separate endeavor. Jeff Liaw : Yes. The purchasing approach is a necessary enabler. I think that was the -- what you were hinting at when it comes to our institutional clients. In the US, a healthy portion of our purchase volume is our direct-to-consumer business, so to speak. This is Cash For Cars in which we buy cars from customers because, to date, it hasn't proven to be a scalable solution to create a consumer-branded Copart. So the better solution for an individual vehicle owner is to buy the car to offer a certain value to them and to sell the car at a profit or so. If we could sell those cars purely on a consignment basis, we probably prefer it. And that certainly holds true for institutional clients as well in the US and elsewhere. In the UK when we entered in 2007, so that's now almost 16, it is 16 years ago when we entered the UK for the first time, the mix there for insurance clients was very heavily principal oriented. Today, we migrated to be a strong majority of those cars being sold on a consignment basis. That is generally our preferred approach, not necessarily because we make more money doing so, but because it is a better alignment of interest with our customers. When we buy cars from them, they want to sell them for the lowest possible value. We want to sell them for the highest possible value, and we're on the opposite side of the trade. When we instead our selling cars on their behalf, we're both rooting for the highest possible outcome and working collaboratively to do so. So it's a better alignment of interest with our institutional clients. It's more conducive to a constructive 20-year relationship than a principal trading counterparty arrangement. Daniel Imbro : Yeah, the Makes a ton of sense. I appreciate all the color and best of luck, guys. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back on ASPs. I think the surprise for me this year is how strong your ASP has been, despite the drop in used car prices as measured by the Manheim index or other sources. I think you've explained that in part as a function of mix. And I'm wondering if you can help us understand the -- how wide the gap is between your insurance ASPs and your noninsurance ASPs and whether that's the fundamental driver to that outperformance? Jeff Liaw : In this case, Craig, it's not the fundamental driver of the performance in the quarter. I would and I think it's fair to acknowledge that if you track Copart ASPs versus Manheim every quarter and go back a lot of years, they're certainly positively correlated and there are certainly some leads and lags. You would have seen our prices jump well before Manheim in the pandemic after the initial declines in the spring of 2020. Our prices increased far earlier than Manheim's ever did. And then in late 2021, if I have my date straight, we would have seen the wholesale market as reflected in that Manheim Index increase rapidly then, we continue to grow as well, but not at the same rate because we had grown earlier still. Today, with Manheim declining somewhat meaningfully year-over-year, our prices have held steady or grown, both for insurance units and noninsurance units. So that outperformance is not principally a shift from insurance to noninsurance. What I would observe, I think, is fair is that with used vehicle prices softening, we see total loss frequency rebounding. When total loss frequency increases and Copart earns the right to sell the marginal vehicle, those marginal vehicles will generally sell for more than the average vehicle before it. So I think that's -- that partially explains the strong performance on price on the insurance side as well as, of course, the auction performance itself. We see more bidders, more bids per vehicle, et cetera, et cetera. All the traditional metrics we used to talk about quarter-to-quarter we're seeing still better auction liquidity even per unit sold than we did a year ago, than we did 5 years ago and so on. So that explains part of it as well. Craig Kennison : And as a follow-up, within your, let's say, dealer service cars or Copart Blue, are you continuing to mix up, in other words, earn the right to sell a more expensive car? And is that in any way a driver to ASP? Jeff Liaw : Less so in this, yes, but less so in this case. In terms of the pure arithmetic for the quarter, that's not the principal driver of our outperformance relative to the Manheim Used Vehicle Index. Craig Kennison : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. When you look at the Blue Car and the dealer cars that you're selling, is the mix of foreign buyers hire in that space? Or do they prefer the salvage cars because they have the arbitrage of low repair cost? Jeff Liaw : I think it's similar, Bret. So, yes, they like the arbitrage or repair costs, but and we're going to pull this up and double check at real time. But I think it's directionally similar. Also like these cars, once brought to the marketplace, that's the point we've made in the past about the flywheel of liquidity. We bring buyers -- we bring vehicles to the buyers and therefore, buyers of the vehicles. And those buyers in turn development an interest for the cars we incrementally bring to the auction as well. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then you called out Hurricane Idalia in the prepared remarks. I guess that was a Q1 event. Was that -- was the cost associated with prepping for that versus the limited cars delivered by that a negative in the quarter? Or is that just sort of a wash? Leah Stearns : That Idalia happened in the first quarter of '24 and so that's not reflected in these numbers. Bret Jordan : No, no, I was asking whether that's an impact in the quarter that we are currently in or? Leah Stearns : Yes. Any costs associated with servicing the hurricanes that occurred in this quarter would impact to the quarter. Bret Jordan : Okay. My question was more like was that a very high-cost prep event that didn't generate the return? I guess, is it a negative for the first quarter? Jeff Liaw : It is, but also to what extent that's just the cost of doing business in 2023 and beyond, right? So we'll talk about next quarter next quarter. We definitely incurred some mobilization costs in preparation for a storm that didn't ultimately materialize. Now I think to be fair, if you look back to major storms like, Harvey, let's go all the way back to 2017, a lot of the massive expenses would be towing costs, temporary leases, short-term leases of racetracks and so forth. In this case, we haven't incurred those kinds of costs in part because we deployed the capital to own the land to be ready for it. So we would likely not have entered into meaningful emergency leases in this case, even had the storm arrived. And as for the towing, the towing largely never materialized at all because the cars weren't there. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then just a quick question on sort of thoughts around the cash balance. Obviously, you guys are still piling it up, despite buying a fair amount of real estate every year. Do you have any, I guess, is it just interest income off of that or are there longer-term strategies around what you do with $2-plus billion? Leah Stearns : Sure. With respect to the current investment strategy, given the fact that we are earning in excess of 5.25 on government T-bills that are short duration and tenure, we are currently comfortable using that until we find a higher and better use, and we continue to look at opportunities to invest. Everything across the spectrum of additional technology, land, logistic opportunities to bring down cost and obviously looking at ways to enhance the broader business that we have. So I don't know, Jeff, do you want to add? Jeff Liaw : Yes. Bret, over the very long haul, as you know, we've returned capital to shareholders via stock buybacks. And no doubt, we will -- we'll do that again. It's a question of when and how. And historically, we've done so both via open market purchases as well as through more structured Dutch tender offerings and so forth. So that is the long-term answer. In the near term, yes, we are investing that cash in treasuries, which are certainly yielding better returns than they would have historically. And we think the fortress balance sheet is of value to ourselves and to our clients. I think it positions us to act very aggressively when we see land purchase opportunities, for example. It equips us to respond to a pandemic in a way that a lesser capitalized company could not, right? The pandemic arrived. I know it feels like a distant memory now, but there's a moment which we wondered if we'd be able to sell a car or if every DMV would shut down. And knowing that we have the capitalization we do, we're able to operate without furloughing employees, without suspending CapEx and we continue our business as is, and we will bend so that our insurance companies can rely upon us. That balance sheet is part of what enables us to be that resilient in that environment. Bret Jordan : Right. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I thought to ask on the Hills Motors acquisition that's gone through with the regulatory approval now. And I heard you say that it was driven by customer preferences in that region. But just curious about maybe gauge your interest in as we think about what you could potentially do with your cash word, et cetera. Your desire inclination to participate in these other sort of adjacencies which might, in some cases, maybe be, I think, competing with buyers of vehicles at your auctions, although not sellers. And is it somehow more restricted to the UK or is there maybe opportunity in the US or are there other potential vertical integrations or adjacencies that maybe we're not thinking of that could potentially be attractive to expand into inorganically? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think that's an appropriate question. And when we consider areas in which we would expand strategically, we certainly always start with the question, what are we good at and where can we deploy those capabilities most profitably? And I think what we know we're good at is managing a high-volume digital auction platform, which we've done now for literally 20 years. So we started that in 2003 and have refined our approach repeatedly over the years and think we have a best-in-class online digital real-time auction platform, part one. Part two, I think we're good at managing the complex physical logistics of moving cars around, literally millions of vehicles that we retrieve from various places, including homeowner premises, dealers, repair shops and the like and deploying all of the employees and subcontractors to retreat them. We think we're good at managing complex regulatory environments as well. So we have 50 different DMVs, a multitude of different countries that we serve that have different title processes and so forth, and we can navigate those universe as well. And so knowing all of that, we consider strategically how do we deploy those capabilities. You know, having followed us for years that we are careful about that. We acquired National Powersport Auctions in 2017, which sells wholesale motorcycles. And we have not expanded beyond the perimeter of Copart except to expand ourselves into new countries very meaningfully since then. So all of those investment opportunities would face a very high bar for us to pursue. In the specific question you raised, there are markets in which we participate today. For example, the US in which the dismantling industry and the use of alternative parts is a well-trodden path already. The insurance industry, the repair industry here is well accustomed to that. And so there are many companies, including public companies that are in that business today, I think it's unlikely we would ever ourselves enter that space in part for the reasons you articulated, which is that we are the neutral intermediary that is optimizing auction proceeds for our customers. And if the best possible economic outcome for that car is dismantled, the dismantle will buy it. If the best possible outcome for that car is that it is driven again in the US or in Poland or in Nigeria, then our auction will find that buyer as well. As you noted, in this case in the UK, perhaps elsewhere in Europe, there has been less -- has been less penetration in alternative parts utilization. And to help turbocharge that some of our customers have made that specific request that they would like us to assist them in that. They don't -- I don't believe they expect us ultimately to dismantle a majority or anywhere close to a majority of the vehicles. The point is that having that capability as well at their request, right, we are very happy, as you know, to be the auction intermediary and to sell the car first and foremost to a third party wherever that third party may be, whether it's in the UK or elsewhere. But in this case, we'll meet our customers where they are and where they were is specifically asking us to take this on, and we're happy to do it. Ryan Brinkman : That's very helpful. And then just lastly, I'd be interested to get any updated thoughts that you might have on the whole car market. I'm not sure what percentage of the Copart Blue is sort of represented by the traditional whole car market. If you have any thoughts on -- because you still participate there via, I think, physical auctions, right, although you're selling them virtually. Does that meet the requirements for selling repossession vehicles, which I think can't be sold like just purely online? And just get your thoughts on the kind of online-only whole car space? And if that's anything you might ever desire to expand into? Jeff Liaw : It's possible. I misunderstand your question, but we certainly have expanded into and or? Ryan Brinkman : Like what openlane and ACV might do, for example, online-only Jeff Liaw : We do, I mean, in some respects, compete with them as it stands today. We are trying to earn the right to sell those cars from financial institutions, from corporate fleets, rental car fleets and the like. So we compete with many industry participants, including the traditional physical auction houses you have in mind. So that's a reality and has been for a long time, call it 3/4 of our business or thereabouts is insurance and the balance is not. And so if somehow the insurance -- if somehow we were to separate the businesses, which for all the reasons you've heard on this call today, we never would. But our noninsurance business itself would be a large-scale auction house without insurance whatsoever. Now so it turns out that having the two combined massively enhances the value proposition for both sides of it as well. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, thanks for letting me back in the queue. I just wanted to follow-up on the UK business. You mentioned, Jeff, that insurers want you to be more vertically integrated there and you're going to meet them where they're at, which I understand. But is there some future state of the world where you could divest that dismantling business piece or is there a fundamental need for that to be connected in the UK, and I just don't understand it. Jeff Liaw : Well, there's no expectation that we're going to divest it. We don't generally take on initiatives like that intending to -- for them to be temporary. But intellectually, I think the reason you struggle with it, Craig, is you are natively a US analyst and you are accustomed to decades of an industry in which the auction houses and the dismantlers and the repair shops are altogether separate pieces of the value chain, right? You've never seen them intermingled, and that's how we've operated now for 40 years and change. We've always preferred the notion of pure neutrality, and we'll sell the car to whomever values it -- to whoever, pardon me, values the car, the most whatever they're going to do with. In the UK, we've heard loud and clear, and it's not a one-off request, right, it is a near consensus view among the industry that there is value in their salvage auction provider, likewise providing access to dismantle parts. And so we want to address that head on. Ultimately, the customers' preferences prevail. We can certainly articulate to them why we think the circular economy can be equally supported with third parties doing the dismantling, but we are also happy to do it if that's what they would like us to do. Craig Kennison : And is that unique to the UK or are there other markets in Europe, for example, that have that same request? Jeff Liaw : I think it remains to be same. There are a lot of different forces at work here, including divergent views about alternative parts utilization. So there are some countries you can imagine in which the OEMs are very influential and they're able to preference insurance companies and repair shops to use first fit parts. There are other countries in which the carbon reduction initiative is more critical. And therefore, the use of recycled parts is more important. So I don't think it's the UK alone, but it was certainly the UK most acutely, but this is also a dynamic game, right? There's no question that preferences will change over the course of the next year three and five in many of the countries in which we do business. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Okay. Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us for the fourth quarter and we'll talk to you after Q1. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  Before turning the call over to management, I will share Copart's Safe Harbor Statement. The company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Security Laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, and uncertainties in the company's markets.  These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2023, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's Co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Please go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Liaw : Good evening. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call. Let me hand it to Leah briefly for the Safe Harbor. Leah Stearns : Oh no, they already did that. Jeff Liaw : Oh, they already did it, pardon. Well, let's dive in. I'll keep my comments brief. We'll highlight a few recurring themes that you've heard about \u2013 that you've heard previously before handing the call to Leah for a more in-depth look at the first quarter, and then we'll take your questions as well.  First, as for our insurance business, we continue to observe a rebound in total loss frequency in the quarter. As you may recall, total loss frequency troughed at just north of 17% in the second calendar quarter of 2022, and it is now 19.3%, according to CCC, in the third calendar quarter of 2023.  You'll note though, that today's total loss frequency remains substantially below pre-COVID highs of 21.7% in the fourth calendar quarter of 2020. We continue to believe the total loss frequency will revert in time to historical levels and eventually well beyond in keeping with all recorded history on this statistic.  Our expectation, our continued expectation is that new and used vehicle prices are likely to stabilize, perhaps decrease more. If and when they do, to do so more steeply than repair costs will, driving an ongoing recovery in total loss frequency.  For the third calendar quarter of 2023 specifically, we observed a 4% decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, while accident severity increased by 4% over that same period, as reported by ISS Fast Track.  Although our U.S. insurance volumes continue to increase up 9.7% year-over-year for the quarter, we estimate that total loss volumes continue to remain suppressed when compared to historical total loss frequency norms. And then, as you've heard us say before, a brief reminder on the long-term drivers of total loss frequency.  First, vehicles become more expensive to repair with rising vehicle complexity, advanced components on the perimeter of vehicles in particular, rising labor costs and parts prices. And then, just as importantly, a rising demand for mobility in growing economies and our auction platform and marketing efforts accessing those prospective buyers.  A brief note on the storm season. On our last call, we had talked about a potentially very active storm season, and at that moment we'd experienced 12 named storms, and we've had nine more since, up over 50% versus 2022. Ultimately, only a handful of these storms made landfall in the U.S., with none of them causing a substantial number of vehicular losses in comparison to prior years.  We know all of this now, of course, with the benefit of hindsight. Storms, however, are inherently unpredictable, and the storm season was sufficiently active to cause us to deploy hundreds of team members, co-part owned and third-party tow trucks, co-part owned loaders, telecom equipment, and generators all over the country in anticipation of major loss events.  Last year, Hurricane Ian, the largest storm in our history as measured by Consigned Vehicles, caused us to incur substantial costs, including in the first quarter of 2023, with those units subsequently sold largely in the second and third quarters of fiscal \u201823. We view these undertakings in the aggregate as the normal cost of business in providing excellent service to our customers and our communities.  Turning then to our sellers beyond insurance, we continue to grow our Blue Car business, serving specifically the bank and finance, fleet and rental sellers. In the first quarter we observed year-over-year growth of over 35%. We increased our dealer sales volume over that same period by 13% year-over-year. We speak frequently about the flywheel effect of our platform and the global buyer base that we serve. Our ongoing growth in these non-insurance customer segments illustrates our ability to leverage the scale and momentum of this flywheel effect, maximizing auction liquidity and ultimately returns for all sellers, insurance and otherwise.  I'll take a moment to comment about our auctions outside of the automotive arena. In addition to gains in the insurance and non-insurance passenger vehicle space, we continue to grow our specialty equipment business as well. By virtue of our serving our insurance and dealer clients, we have long been a substantial remarketer of specialty equipment, including in transportation, construction and agricultural realms.  This past quarter we were pleased to announce a strategic investment in Purple Wave. We have known Aaron and Suzy McKee for over a decade and admire the excellent and growing business in Purple Wave that they and their team have built. They share our ownership mindset, a commitment to delivering excellent outcomes to their marketplace participants, and a digital-first approach. We're delighted to welcome the Purple Wave team and community to the Copart family.  Finally, on the subject of sustainability, last November we published our inaugural ESG report, our first-ever account of our commitment and contributions to environmental sustainability, global economic empowerment, enterprise sustainability, and community sustainability.  We intend to publish our 2023 update in the next month or so. In it, we'll provide updated data on the enhanced mobility that our marketplace provides to developing economies, the accelerated recovery we enable in communities affected by extreme weather events, and our focus on workplace diversity, equity and satisfaction.  And on the critical subject of environmental sustainability, we will again underscore and quantify the emissions avoidance that our business enables. We, of course invest time and resources to optimize our own CO2-equivalent emissions and energy consumption, but overwhelmingly, our most substantial contribution to environmental sustainability is in enabling the recycling and reuse of vehicles and their component parts and materials, meaningfully reducing what would otherwise be the more substantial carbon footprint of new vehicle and parts manufacturing.  As our volume grows, so too does this carbon emissions avoidance. In 2023 we estimate that we have helped the world avoid over 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, up roughly 10% year-over-year, and over 100x more than our actual direct emissions. With that, I'll turn it over to Leah. Leah Stearns : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin with our sales trends for the first quarter. During the quarter, our global unit sales and inventory increased nearly 13% and 3%, respectively. Given the relatively quiet hurricane season in 2023, our inventory growth was a function of a partial recovery in total loss frequency and share gain. During the quarter, we saw global ASPs decline by approximately 1% versus the prior year.  Focusing on our U.S. business, we experienced strong unit growth of over 10%, which reflected fee unit growth over 10% and purchase unit growth of 14%. Consignment or fee units continue to generate the vast majority of co-parts volume growth, with our insurance units posting nearly 10%, our dealer units posting 13% growth, and our Blue Car units, which include units from fleet, rental and finance companies posting over 35% growth. This unit growth was modestly offset by a decline in low value units from wholesalers and charities. Inventory levels in the U.S. increased 1% or nearly 12% when excluding low value units and CAD units. In the U.S., ASPs were down 2%, and more specifically, insurance ASPs were down 1.7% compared to the 4% decrease in the Manheim Used Vehicle Price Index.  Turning to our international business, we saw unit growth of over 24%, with fee units increasing over 28%, and purchase units increasing by over 4%. Our international business ended the quarter with inventory levels nearly 14% ahead of the prior year. International ASPs were up 7% compared to the prior year period.  Our auction returns remain strong as we continue to invest in growing our global buyer base by driving member acquisition, activation, and retention. Copart\u2019s auctions provide our insurance customers with best-in-class liquidity and returns, ultimately providing a more cost-effective way to manage growing claims costs by making it more cost-effective to deem damaged vehicles a total loss.  In addition, we continue to invest in expanding our products and services to serve a more diverse mix of sellers and unit types. Examples of this include our national sales, such as our specialty equipment auctions, which primarily sell heavy and medium-duty trucks and agricultural equipment, and our select auction which sells clean title vehicles and now provides buyers with greater transparency in vehicle quality through sale lights and an arbitration policy. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter, global revenue increased $127 million or about 14%, including a 1% tailwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased nearly $133 million or over 18% for the first quarter, primarily due to higher average revenue per unit and increased volume. U.S. service revenue grew by 17%, and international service revenue grew by 29%.  Global purchased vehicle sales for the first quarter decreased about $6 million or 3%, with U.S. purchased vehicle revenue for the quarter down 19%, which was primarily due to a mix shift, with the decline in our power sports business and PA being offset by an increase in our Copart direct cash-for-cars purchased vehicle revenue.  The U.S. decline was offset by international growth of 19%. Global purchased vehicle gross profit decreased about $2 million for the quarter, with U.S. purchased vehicle gross profit increasing about $2 million and international purchased vehicle gross profit decreasing $4 million, reflecting a 29% increase in cost of vehicle sales. Global gross profit in the first quarter increased over $94 million or about 26%, and our gross margin percentage increased by approximately 400 basis points to 45.5%. This reflects U.S. margins which increased to 49.9%, and international margins decreasing to 24.9%.  The year-over-year margin increase on a consolidated basis was driven primarily by a mix shift due to the strong growth in fee units in the U.S., which was partially offset by the impact of inflation and a slight decline in purchase unit margins internationally.  On the cost front, during the first quarter of last year, we incurred cap costs, cap expenses specifically related to Hurricane Ian, which did not recur. Operationally, we are focusing on increasingly standardizing processes and leveraging technology and automation to mitigate the inflationary impacts we've experienced across our business. We expect these efforts will drive greater scalability and efficiency across the organization and help mitigate longer-term cost pressures.  Turning to general and administrative expenditures, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation expenses, G&A's spend in the quarter was $58 million, reflecting an increase in $13 million and includes $3 million due to a one-time maintenance project, the financial consolidation of Purple Wave into our results, and the impact of our overall growth in business. Over the long run, we continue to expect operating leverage as we grow.  Because of our strong revenue growth and moderate cost increases, GAAP operating income increased by nearly 27% to over $395 million for the quarter. First quarter income tax expense was nearly $91 million, which reflects a 21.4% effective tax rate. And finally, first quarter GAAP net income increased by over 35% to over $332 million or $0.34 per diluted common share.  Turning to our liquidity and financial position, liquidity was $3.9 billion as of Q1, which is comprised of $2.6 billion in cash and investments in held to maturity securities and our capacity under our revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of over $375 million, which is an increase of 20% from the prior year period.  In addition, during the first quarter, we invested about $162 million in capital expenditures, with nearly 80% of this amount attributable to our physical infrastructure, and more specifically, capacity expansion, which contributes to our ability to serve our customers while simultaneously reducing our transportation costs and corresponding fuel consumption. Finally, for the quarter, if you take operating cash less CapEx, we've generated $213 million of free cash flow.  I'll conclude with a few remarks about our capital allocation strategy, focusing on investing in our core business and corporate development.  We remain focused on building long-term value for our shareholders and endeavor to continue our strong track record for years to come. To achieve this, we will continue to use our disciplined approach to capital allocation and remain patient, flexible and opportunistic. Our first priority is to deploy capital to grow our core business, where we will continue to invest in our people, operational capabilities, including logistics, technology and real estate, as well as our customer experience. We also focus on opportunities to diversify our business, including expanding our marketplace capabilities into new geographies or to service new asset types. A prime example of this was our investment into Purple Wave, which like NPA, brings a leading marketplace for a specialized used unit type, which in Purple Wave's case, spans construction agate fleet.  And further, we seek to partner with leaders in areas of technology and innovation, which expand beyond Copart\u2019s core business, but directly support our customers' needs. This includes in InsureTech, where we recently announced a strategic partnership with Hi Marley to accelerate the total loss process for our customers and their policyholders. This approach provides us ample opportunities to grow our core and drive diversification across our business. And with that, Jeff and I would be happy to take some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question today is coming from Bob Labick from CJS Securities. Your line is now live. Bob Labick : Good afternoon. Congratulations on continued strong performance. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Leah Stearns : Thanks Bob. Bob Labick : I wanted to start with Purple Wave. It's an exciting announcement you made I guess last month, and obviously you talked a little bit about it. But maybe you could talk \u2013 discuss further what Copart brings to the relationship in addition to obviously to capital. And what are the key goals of the investment, and how will you define success in three to five years? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Well Bob, as you know, having followed us for a while, we've talked in the past on multiple occasions about our potential interest in parlaying our expertise in managing high-volume digital auctions, parlaying that expertise into other arenas, including for industrial construction and agricultural equipment. We've actually said that specifically.  And as you know, those kinds of expansions have had to clear a very high bar in the past. We invested or acquired National Power Sports Auctions in 2017 and have been very careful or disciplined about extending beyond that before and since. We've known Aaron and Suzy forever, literally before I arrived at Copart myself, and we have tremendous respect for the community and the business that they and their team have built.  As you noted, we'll bring capital, expertise and relationships to help grow their business, and they, in turn, provide us with additional expertise in the equipment space, as MPA did in Power Sports as well. So we'll measure growth as we \u2013 we\u2019ll measure success or determine success as we do with our own core business. Are we able to grow it profitably to serve more buyers and sellers in a meaningful way over the course of the next five, 10 and 20 years? Bob Labick : Okay, great. And then, obviously, you highlighted a lot of success. You have a lot of major initiatives going on or I guess just ongoing initiatives, including gaining market share in the insurance and salvage market, the acceleration and whole car market, Purple Wave, which we just talked about, and your international growth. How do you prioritize time and capital, and how would you rank the time and capital investments towards those initiatives, salvage market share gains, whole car acceleration, Purple Wave and international growth? Jeff Liaw : Yeah, I think it's a fair question. And as you know, Bob, we maintain a conservative balance sheet in part so that capital is by and large not the constraint, that when there are opportunities to serve our sellers and buyers better, to grow our platform, to grow our business, that we aren't constrained at the moment, and also so that we can opportunistically acquire real estate and so forth.  But the ultimate scarce resource is our own bandwidth, our ability to pursue initiatives successfully. I think you highlighted, really, the priorities for the enterprise, and I don't think we stack rank them necessarily. It's critical to us that we serve our insurance sellers and buyers better over the years to come. We mentioned in passing some of the tools that we're working on to equip them to make better and faster decisions, to yield better economic outcomes. In particular, we've been focused on reducing their advance charges. In many cases insurance companies incur literally thousands of dollars of storage and tear-down costs on cars that any one of us would have known as a total loss at the scene of the accident. And we are committed to developing the tools and processes to enable them to sidestep that entire food chain, just to avoid all those unnecessary costs that ultimately inflate their claims costs as a result.  So insurance is critical. The international markets as you noted are critical to us as well. As you know, also, even using one word to capture all of them, it's an oversimplification. Canada and Brazil and Germany and the U.K. and Finland are all radically different from one another, the Middle East and Spain and so forth, but growth there is a priority as well.  And then certainly as you know and as you've seen in the unit growth trajectory, the non-insurance domain is important to us, not just in isolation, not just because it is a profitable and growing enterprise, but because we view it as instrumental to serving our insurance companies better as well. The liquidity flywheel is real, and it's our job to make sure that we're spinning it faster with each passing year. Bob Labick : Great. Thank you very much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is now live. Craig Kennison : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question as well. I wanted to follow up on Purple Wave. And I'm curious, is there a chance that your real estate footprint brings new value to this platform? It's my understanding they have an on-site auction process, and I'm curious if your real estate is part of the synergy you see. Jeff Liaw : Craig, they have built one of the very largest yellow iron auction platforms without any real estate whatsoever. So they have a digital-only platform, as you noted, to sell in place. On the margin, I think we look to opportunities to potentially partner with them. That's not ultimately the foundation of the investment itself. It really is backing an exceptional team that's built an exceptional community and business. So we'll explore those kinds of ways to cooperate, whether it comes to customer relationships, certain technology expertise, real estate in some cases, and so forth. Those are all on the table, but fundamentally it is about backing an exceptional team. Craig Kennison : And are you in a position now to bid on large liquidations? We know there was one, Yellow, for example. Are you able to help them bid on those types of deals? Was that always possible for them, given their footprint? Jeff Liaw : I think we are able. I'm not \u2013 that doesn't mean we will. But really across our entire business, principal investments in inventory are just a necessary enabling mechanism to ultimately win consignment volume. So there was an era in which we bought the vast majority of the vehicles we sold on behalf of insurance companies from them, so we took the principal risk on the cars.  Over time, the better customer service outcome is for us to sell it on the consignment basis for our sellers and we to sit on the same side of the table, rooting for the highest possible prices. So if we were to do so in the Yellow Iron arena, it would again, be as an enabling mechanism to a consignment future. It is not an end state in and of itself. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And one for you, Leah, if I could. I think you mentioned incurring some cost as you deployed resources in advance of potential hurricane situations. Even though that didn't produce volume, you still had to incur that cost. Is there a way to quantify the implication there? The impact. Leah Stearns : No, it's really just part of our ongoing normalized cost structure. We do it every year in anticipation of hurricane season, and we did the same thing this year as we had done previously. We just did not experience the elevated level of repositioning folks and the kind of acute cost levels that we experience when there is a severe storm that does actually hit, and there's significant recoveries that happen shortly thereafter.  So I would not look to call it out specifically, because it's just part of our ongoing cost structure. Jeff Liaw : Craig, I would characterize in the aggregate, it's very substantial, right. Meaning, we could undertake the rigorous accounting exercise of figuring out how much have we spent. Once and on an ongoing basis to maintain ex hundreds of acres of available land in Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, etcetera.  We could quantify the elevated tow expense we pay year round by virtue of operating our own trucks, etcetera, etcetera, and try to capture the full life cycle elevated cost that we incur as a result. But in the end, we just accept that it's a necessary cost of doing business. It helps empower our customers to trust us in a time of need. And if volume suddenly spikes 10x or 20-fold in a given region, that we very much are positioned to handle it. Craig Kennison : That's great. Yeah, thank you, Jeff and Leah. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is now live. Daniel Imbro : Yeah. Hey, good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff Liaw : Hey Dan. Daniel Imbro : Jeff, I wanted to start maybe on the insurance side. Maybe ask another way on the market share, obviously there was a peer talking about some share shifting. I don't think you'll comment on it, but more curious around when you measure success or how you measure your comparative returns to the industry or to peers, are you seeing that gap widen? And if so, is that accelerating with all the investments, the strategic investments you're making? Jeff Liaw : Yeah Daniel, I think it's a fair question. I think you rightly anticipated our reluctance. As you know, we don't comment \u2013 out of respect, frankly, for the confidential decision-making processes of our clients, we just don't want to comment on them individually. But generally, I think you are rightly focused on the ultimate decision rule, which is the delivered economic outcomes that we provide to our customers.  And so if I had to more generically say, how does an insurance company decide who to use for their salvage remarketing services, I'd cite five general principles. One is delivered auction outcomes. We believe we're truly differentiated by virtue of our global buyer base and our auction platform. We believe \u2013 and by the way, we define our competition pretty expansively, right. It's not just the competitor that you have in mind, but it's all the other possible outcomes for vehicles, whether it's repair, owner retention, sale through other auction platforms, hand-selling, retailing, from the perspective of our rental car customers. We define that competition very expansively.  But nonetheless, the five principles are \u2013 or the five priorities are delivered auction returns, the service that we provide to our sellers, as measured in our ability to recover vehicles, in some cases from very difficult circumstances, our ability to process titles efficiently, and to provide them with the tools they need to make better and faster decisions. The third element I'd cite is the service we provide to our clients' clients. So, in the case of insurance, to the policyholders to whom we believe we provide a differentiated title retrieval and loan payoff process today, with the gap widening over time as well.  Fourth, I'd say is the ability to do all of the above, both in the ordinary course, as well as in an extreme weather event, to gracefully manage all of these processes, even if volume again spikes ten-fold or twenty-fold in a given period of time in a given region.  And then fifth, and I think this is more esoteric, but I think it's real, is the assurance that due to our land ownership, our technology platform, our people and culture and capital structure, that we're here for the long haul, and that when we make promises, we will absolutely deliver on them.  So to your narrower question about the auction returns, I do believe the gap is substantial. I do believe that it's growing. Now, it's difficult to quantify, because no given car is ever transacted on multiple platforms, right. The car sells here or it is sold at a rental car retail lot, or it's sold at a different auction house. And so a true, perfectly apples-to-apples comparison in a given moment is difficult. But I think the evidence, the preponderance of the evidence based on seller behavior over the years, is yes, that we deliver superior economic outcomes, in large part due to better auction returns, but also to the service elements that I cited a moment ago. Daniel Imbro : Understood. Have to try sometimes. And then maybe a follow-up on the non-insurance side. You've gained, obviously, a lot of market share in the last few years. Into \u201824, obviously that wholesale volume backdrop should improve just as we look across dealer or commercial. I guess, can you talk about incremental cost to serve? Are those vehicles any more cumbersome on the income statement, as you think about any selling costs associated with that volume or would it be a similar kind of incremental flow-through, as we think about just typical insurance volume? Jeff Liaw : Individually, they are not materially different. I think to serve financial institutions, there are certainly a different level of compliance and certain different processes. So it's more like when we choose to emphasize a new type of seller, we have to develop certain capabilities of equal disclosure and otherwise. So it's not per se volume-driven. It's more just the nature of the sellers that we're targeting. I think by and large the categories we've now all touched, so I don't think the contribution economics are materially different. Leah Stearns : And, Daniel, I would just add that we've spent a lot of time over the last 12 months developing the capabilities across our technology platform to address some of those needs. So the sale as I talked about arbitration policy that is now available at Copart, those are all items that are more familiar to our Blue Car seller \u2013 or sorry, the members who are purchasing those Blue Car units. And so we've been forward-thinking about preparing ourselves for that potential future demand. Daniel Imbro : Great. Thank you both for all the color and best of luck! Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Daniel. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Bret Jordan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jeff Liaw : Hey, Bret. Bret Jordan : On the international side, could you talk a bit more specifically about what you're seeing in the EU? And obviously Germany, Finland, Spain have been potentially large growth markets. Could you address those? Jeff Liaw : Yes. And I'll separate Finland for a moment. Finland is frankly more like the UK, Canada, and the U.S. and that that has long been a gross settlement market in which insurance carriers simply pay the owner's PAB or ACB, the intact value of the car, and then they can sign that vehicle to the salvage auction. So we acquired that salvage auction some years ago, and the business is trending well. Some of the same underlying trends that you expect here \u2013 rising total loss frequency with a dip during the COVID-19 period when vehicle prices skyrocketed. But otherwise, fundamentally similar, though fundamentally, of course, not a huge population or a huge market in and of itself.  Then the UK, I'll set aside as well. That mirrors the U.S. in some regards, obviously some noise from Brexit and otherwise. But by and large, similar overriding picture there, overall picture there, which is to say total loss frequency growth, market share growth and good marginal economics there as well.  As for Germany and Spain, I think that's probably what you have in mind, Germany and Spain and by extension, the rest of Western Europe. Those are the net settlement markets to which we have offered, as you know, a handful of different service propositions, including initially buying cars more aggressively than migrating more to a consignment model.  We continue to build our businesses in both countries. We continue to earn the trust of our insurance company sellers, continue to innovate and experiment with them. So there's nothing radically new to report there. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess housekeeping, the non-insurance business, Blue Car is plus 35 and Dealer is plus 13, could you size those two businesses relative to each other within non-insurance? Jeff Liaw : I don't think we have. They are both meaningful to us in terms of the P&L though. Both Blue Car and the Dealer segments are both meaningful volume, meaningful contribution. You'll hear the carve out when we describe the wholesalers and charities. That's business also that we endeavor to serve. We call these the lower value vehicles. Those together, Copart Direct as well, would constitute, would be characterized as a non-insurance space. But Dealers and Blue Car are the large ones among them. Bret Jordan : Right. But relative to each other, is Dealer larger and that's why it grows at a lower rate or are they similarly sized to the unit standpoint? Jeff Liaw : Dealer is larger, more mature, meaning we've been pursuing that business for longer. Though, as I think you've heard us say in the past, as the insurance business evolves, as more cars look like perfectly intact, drivable vehicles, the buyer base for our vehicles is relevant for more and more of the Dealer cars as well. So it's not a static game with every week or month or year that goes by more Dealer cars are addressable than in the period prior. Bret Jordan : Okay. I love that you converted the treasury position to cash just on the cash flow statement. Is there anything there? Leah Stearns : No, that's just really a reflection of the movement in the yield curve. So the longer than 90-day maturities did mature, and we've held them in shorter than 90-day treasury securities since then. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bret. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from John Healy from Northcoast Research. Your line is now live. Leah Stearns : John? Operator : John, perhaps your phone is on mute. John Healy : Sorry about that guys. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the whole car opportunity. I think you guys talked about the finance business growing multiple digits for you. I assume that's kind of analogous to repo. When you look at the repo business, have you made good strides there? I mean, is that the right way to read it? And when you look at how repo cars kind of moved through the process, I've always thought they went through repo agents, and then they go to impound lots and things like that.  Is there any structural difference with how you are going to market that maybe present in the savings to these finance companies, maybe in terms of storage than maybe what the traditional model held, maybe through other mechanisms of the marketing? Jeff Liaw : John, I think you're right that the vehicles from financial institutions are in large part repossessions. There are other use cases. And repossessions, of course, in some cases are very straightforward and come straight to us from the financial institution. In other cases, the cars can be trapped at impound facilities. We do think we bring some unique capabilities there in terms of the ability to navigate the vehicle retrieval process. It's both \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of technology as well as human expertise. I think we offer both in that regard.  Then of course again, the auction platform itself generates strong returns. So in the aggregate that the ability to get the car faster, the ability in some cases to liberate cars that otherwise would be trapped altogether, that may be abandoned, for example, and then to generate good returns on all of the above is what's enabled our growth there. John Healy : Okay, great. And then just one clarification question. I think when you guys press-released Purple Wave, you guys called it an investment. I think you've used that phrase today a few times, but you've also talked about consolidating that business. Can you just confirm to us how much of that business you bought? And really, what drove you guys from being familiar with them to, in your words, family with them? What drove the timing? And just any thoughts of where we're at in the equipment for marketing cycle, just how you and Leah have studied that? Jeff Liaw : Oh, on that, I don't think we would. We would never characterize ourselves as particularly savvy in timing the market. So it's not that we see a rebound or not in the Yellow Iron space. I think Purple Wave is just a company we have profoundly respected and have had a multiple years-long dialogue with how and why deals ultimately come to \u2013 by the way, the same was true for NPA. Leading up to June of 2017, we've been in dialogue with them for a decade as well.  And what ultimately causes the deal to get over the finish line for two parties to reach that conclusion together is a mix of, of course, objective fact and serendipity and just random timing as well. So it was not our trying to time the market per se.  We have acquired a majority stake in the business. But it was important for us and important for Aaron and Suzy that they continue to retain a meaningful economic share as well. And we are committed and they are committed to growing that business profitably for years to come. John Healy : Great. Thank you, guys. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Bottiglieri from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one is on the \u2013 like where is non-insurance today in mix? I think you've given that a pass. And then two, at the 35% growth in Blue Car sounds really high. Is that just broad-based? I would think a lot of those markets are like cyclically depressed right now. So is it broad-based or did you win like a couple of large accounts that are driving some of that? And then I have a follow-up? Thank you. Jeff Liaw : First question. Leah Stearns : The mix. Jeff Liaw : Oh, 25% circa, and a very seasonal issue, Chris, frankly with charity volumes spiking in the fourth quarter, first calendar quarter. We'll call it one out of \u2013 just from memory over a longer period of time, one out of four cars is from someone that's not an insurance carrier. But as you know, both portions of our business have been growing very meaningfully. So insurance is growing and also the Blue Car, Dealer segments as well.  And then as to your question about growth within the Blue Car arena, it is across different types of sellers. So it includes banks. It includes rental car companies. It includes corporate fleets and its multiple accounts in each. So it's not one big seller driving the performance of that business. Chris Bottiglieri : Yeah, okay. And then the second question is more of a cost question. But when you onboard a larger customer, and this has happened periodically as you've won a lot of accounts over the years, what does this mean for expenses? Do you typically see like an increase in headcount or capacity? Is there anything you\u2019d do differently when you're anticipating a 4% or 5% customer coming on board? How do you handle that? What does that mean for the P&L before that volume arrives? Jeff Liaw : That's a fair question, Chris, and I would say I assume you intend to question largely for insurance. Is that fair? Chris Bottiglieri : Yeah, correct, for insurance. If you win a large insurance customer, how does that impact the P&L ahead of time where the volume shows? Jeff Liaw : It's highly idiosyncratic. There are some insurance carriers that we will serve for the first time or we'll sign them up for the first time. And in that case, the startup costs so to speak, depends in large part on their choice of technology platforms, what their business process looks like, and what it takes for us to integrate with them. In other cases we'll have customers that we already serve and very substantially so, and we're merely taking on additional states that we don't already have. The marginal corporate cost, so to speak, at headquarters for technology and process development and so forth, is more modest in that case, as you might imagine. In the field, the costs certainly are substantial. We will hire additional folks in our facilities to handle both the physical movement and receipt of cars, as well as the back of the house title processing, the title transfer process, loan payoff, title procurement, etcetera, that we scale up as well to serve the customer. And as you noted, generally speaking, somewhat in advance of that customer turning on their new business. We can't afford to drop the ball once it's on, so we make sure we scale up operations beforehand. Chris Bottiglieri : Yeah, so I mean that's what I surmised. Okay, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Unidentified Participant : Hi. This is Josh Batra [ph] on for Ryan Brinkman. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the cadence of auction fees going forward. Do you continue to see room for price increases, even as used car pricing has started to moderate meaningfully over the past few months? And then it seems like some of your peers on the dealer side have increased their fees, and I'm wondering if Copart has followed suit. Jeff Liaw : Yeah, the fees, as you know from having followed us for a while, are something we evaluate on an ongoing basis. We don't adhere to a regular schedule, so to speak, because there's not an annual schedule change of any kind. We evaluate the market, we evaluate competitors, and we evaluate our own value proposition and what we think we're bringing to the ecosystem broadly. So we have not in the past commented on this matter specifically. I don't expect that we will any time soon. Unidentified Participant : Got it. That's helpful, color. And then as a follow-up, the broader wholesale industry environment seems to be getting more supportive of the Blue Car and Dealer wholesale initiative. And while growth is already very solid there, just wondering, given the backdrop, what would you be considering to accelerate the growth in those segments into 2024? Jeff Liaw : No step function changes. I think it's a matter of further execution on our part. We continue to invest very aggressively in our international buyer base. And there are, as I noted, a host of different competitors that we encounter in this space.  We think that our value proposition is principally that we are very efficient at retrieving vehicles, and we are very effective at finding the highest and best use of that vehicle wherever that is in the world. That international buyer base is powerful for that business segment as well. And our online platform, Digital First Sales, I think ultimately identifies the right buyer for that car wherever that person is in the world.  So there's no step function change. You'll see, or our sellers will see additional enhancements, additional capabilities, but I wouldn't characterize any of them as being a meaningful step function change. Unidentified Participant : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and good luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Leah Stearns : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Jeff for any further closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Nope. Thank you everybody. We'll talk to you after the second quarter. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before turning the call over to management, I will share Copart's Safe Harbor Statement. The company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities, and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2023, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's Co-CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Good evening. And thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. I'll start my comments today with commentary about our business, I\u2019ll than talk about a few recent additions to our senior leadership team before handing the call to Leah to review our financial results. And then she and I will take your questions.  First on our insurance business for the quarter. We're pleased with our ongoing profitable growth with our insurance sellers, albeit with the year-over-year noise of a significant catastrophic event in the first and second quarters of last year in the form of hurricane Ian, which I'll comment on in a moment. As anticipated, new and used vehicle prices have decreased somewhat steeply in the past few quarters while repair costs continue to increase. Those factors have driven a strong and continued recovery in total loss frequency. For the months that comprise our second fiscal quarter, we noted a 7% year-over-year decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index.  At the same time accident severity as measured in cost of repair increased 1.7%, over that same period -- or pardon me, during the third calendar quarter of 2023. The most recently available measurement period, as reported by ISS Fast Track. Despite the decrease of 7% in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, our U.S. insurance selling prices by comparison have remained flat year-over-year, a reflection of our auction liquidity and buyer activity after adjusting for the removal of hurricane Ian from the prior year. As I noted the combination of these forces, decreasing used vehicle values and increasing repair costs has driven a recovery in total loss frequency. According to CCC, total loss frequency for the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 was 20.9% across all loss categories. This is up almost a full percentage point year-over-year and up 1.5% sequentially.  As always, we continue to believe that long run trends continue to make repairing vehicles less economically attractive to insurance carriers and totaling vehicles more economically attractive to them at the same time. Our nominal U.S. insurance volumes increased just 0.3% year-over-year, so largely again due to the effect of the sell-through of units from Hurricane Ian a year ago. While we responded to multiple smaller weather events this year, they did not in the aggregate approach the magnitude of Hurricane Ian. Normalized for Ian's impact, we estimate our U.S. insurance volume to increase 9.2% for the period, a reflection again of total loss trends and market share growth.  Turning to our non-insurance business. First, we continue to grow our Blue Car business which serves our bank and finance fleet and rental partners in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 -- pardon me 2024 we observed year-over-year growth of north of 30%. Likewise, our dealer sales volume, a combination of our CDS business unit and MPA, our power sports auction platform, our volume increased by 21% year-over-year as well. All told our U.S. non-insurance automotive volume, excluding low value and wholesale units increased north of 30% year-over-year. Our growth is the result of our commitment to customer service and our auction liquidity. With each additional vehicle we earn the right to sell, we increase the attractiveness of our auction platform to the world's automotive buyers, drawing still more buyers to our auctions to the benefit of all of our sellers, new and old.  I'll conclude my comments with a brief welcome and introduction to three new members of the Copart Executive team, who joined us this quarter. First David King -- David Kang, pardon me, our new Chief Marketing Officer and Neel Madhvani, our new Chief Product Officer, Dave and Neel bring with them the experience and expertise of global marketing brand communications, and member in product development on behalf of world class digital businesses. Dave's previous roles included serving as the SVP of data insights, and as Chief Marketing Officer for consumer auto finance at Capital One, as well as various roles with McKinsey and Company previously.  Neel served most recently as VP of product at Chewy and held various strategy roles at Boxed and Staples. Together they bring a data centric approach to strategy, leadership, and customer experience that aligns well with our business objectives.  I'll take a moment to thank Steve Powers our longtime Chief Operating Officer who is transitioning to his new role as Chief Business Development Officer. He and his team have navigated our business through years now of pandemic response, abundant storm activity and various disruptive forces in our industry.  We extend a warm welcome to Hessel Verhage his successor as COO. Hessel was the supply chain leader for DB Schenker, one of the world's largest and most complex logistics providers for a litany of demanding clients such as Procter and Gamble, BMW, Apple, and many, many others. Hessel will spearhead our efforts to sustain and extend what we believe to be a substantial competitive advantage in our physical operations.  With a mix of new and experienced leadership, we believe we are well equipped to continue our profitable growth. Our bedrock operating principles, of course remain the same. We emphasize providing outstanding economic outcomes to our sellers through excellent service and auction results and to provide the best auction liquidity and experience to our members.  With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO Leah Stearns. Leah Stearns : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin with our second quarter sales trends. During the quarter our global unit sales and inventory increased over 7% and 6% respectively, from the year ago period. Given the relatively quiet 2023 hurricane season, this growth was a function of a partial recovery, total loss frequency and shared gains.  Focusing on our U.S. business, unit growth with nearly 5%, which reflected fee unit growth, over 4% and purchase unit growth of over 10% consignment or fee units continued to constitute the vast majority of our U.S. unit volume. Our insurance unit volume was flat year-over-year and up 9%, when excluding Hurricane Ian units from a year ago. And as Jeff mentioned, our non-insurance unit volume growth has continued to outpace that of our insurance business. This volume growth substantially came from dealer units which increase over 21% and fleet rental and finance units which increased 35%. Inventory levels in the U.S. increased over 4% and over 6% when excluding low value and cat units. Turning to our international business. We saw unit growth of over 21% with fee units increasing 22% and purchased units increasing by over 19%. Our international business ended the quarter with inventory levels over 16% ahead of prior year. For the quarter, global ASPs and U.S. insurance ASPs declined by nearly 5% from the year ago period, and U.S. insurance ASPs excluding Hurricane Ian units were flat. In addition, international ASPs were up about 1%. Overall, our ASPs continue to show resilience compared to the more than 7% year-over-year decrease in the Manheim used vehicle price index for the quarter. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter. Global revenue increased to $1.02 billion, representing growth of over $63 million or about 7%, including a 0.7% tailwind due to currency. Global service revenue increased nearly $72 million or over 9% for the second quarter, primarily due to higher average revenue per unit and increased volumes. Our U.S. Service revenue grew by over 7% and international service revenue grew by nearly 26% for the quarter. Global purchased vehicle sales for the second quarter decreased to about $8 million or 5% and global purchased vehicle gross profit decreased by less than $1 million. In the U.S., purchased vehicle revenue was down over $7 million or about 9%, which was primarily due to a mix shift towards lower ASP units, while gross profit increased over $1 million. Internationally, purchased vehicle revenue decreased by $1 million or about 1% and gross profit decreased by $2 million. Global gross profit increased to more than $464 million an increase of nearly $38 million or about 9%, and our gross profit margin percentage increased by approximately 100 basis points to 45.5%.  In the U.S., our gross profit margin increased to 50.2% and our international gross profit margin increased to 24.9%. The year-over-year margin increase on a consolidated basis was driven primarily by a revenue mix shift resulting from strong growth in fee units, which generate higher margins and a decline in direct cost per unit sold. On the cost front, during the first and second quarter of last year, we incurred cat expenses, specifically related to Hurricane Ian, which did not occur. Turning to general and administrative expenditures, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation expenses. G&A spend in the quarter was over $72 million, reflecting an increase of over $24 million. The increase in G&A includes over $3 million in onetime costs associated with the conclusion of our CMA process in the U.K.  The remainder reflects the financial consolidation of Purple Wave into our results, third-party project-related costs and the impact of investments in our technology and sales organizations to support Copart's business growth. We expect that the investments we are making in our people, processes and systems will provide us with greater operating leverage over the long run. As a result, GAAP operating income increased by nearly 4% to $380 million. Finally, second quarter GAAP net income increased by nearly 11% to over $325 million or $0.33 per diluted common share. During the quarter, we benefited from nearly $20 million of incremental interest income as we have actively invested our cash into treasury securities as well as a lower tax rate of 20.7%. Turning to our liquidity and financial position. Liquidity was $3.9 billion as of the end of January, which is comprised of nearly $2.7 billion in cash and investments in held to maturity securities and our capacity under our revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $162 million, which is a decrease of 14% from the prior year. In addition, we invested about $123 million in capital expenditures, with nearly all of this amount attributable to our real estate and physical infrastructure to support capacity expansion, which contributes to our ability to serve our customers while simultaneously reducing our transportation costs and corresponding fuel consumption. Finally, for the quarter, if you take our operating cash flow, less CapEx, we've generated about $39 million of free cash flow. As I've highlighted in the past, our top priority is to invest to grow our core business. To achieve this, over the last 12 months, we have deployed over $540 million into our real estate portfolio, fleet and technology to provide best-in-class products and services to our customers. And with that, Jeff and I will be happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Lukas : Yes. Hi, good afternoon. It's Peter Lukas for Bob. First, just a general question. I was just wondering, can international buyers on your U.S. platform easily buy at other auctions, a German, Finland, et cetera? Or do they have different log-ins and different interfaces? Basically, just trying to understand if all your buyers are seeing global auctions equally and getting alerts on the cars they're looking for, regardless of point of origin. Jeff Liaw : Pete, good to hear from you, and thanks for your question. In short, copart.com, is certainly a unified platform period. We do have, by virtue in some cases, of different regulatory and licensing requirements and so forth, separate registration paths for that reason. But ultimately, we are one global auction platform with buyers, many buyers purchasing vehicles on multiple of our -- from multiple of our countries. Peter Lukas : Helpful. Thanks. And then just one more. I guess, in terms of the whole car side, given the relatively recent additions of arbitration and outsourced inspections in the industry, how would you describe Copart's role and in the non-salvage market versus other industry participants? Jeff Liaw : I think -- the market, as you know, is a dynamic one and looks different today even from what you might have seen five years ago and certainly a decade ago. And I think even our offering at the same time, continues to evolve as well as we better understand and respond to the needs of our very different types of sellers.  So even though we talk about non-insurance as though it is one monolithic entity, as you understand, I'm sure a bank with a repossession acts very differently from a rental car fleet, acts very differently from a dealer as well. And they, in turn, have a variety of different service needs and requests in terms of the degree in terms of compliance, certainly, but also the degree to which we are assessing and altering the vehicles themselves. So our offering has evolved even over the past few years and will continue to evolve in response to those seller needs for years to come. So we are quite a bit more sophisticated today even than we were a decade ago, but those offerings will continue to expand in the years ahead. Peter Lukas : Great, thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Imbro : Hi, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start on a longer-term one on the top line. The total loss rate, I think you said 20.9%. I believe that exceeds prior highs we saw last time before this kind of near-term dip. If we dig into that data, how divergent are different carriers on your platform? Are you seeing some that are already in maybe the high 20s? And I think in the past, you've said you thought total loss rate could exceed 30% over the very long term. Is that still an applicable long-term goal, I guess, as you see the data today? Jeff Liaw : I appreciate the question. First, at least from memory, I thought total loss frequency approach to 22%. Yes, 21.7% at one point before the pandemic. So we're not all the way back, though, I think that's a matter of time. To the second part of your question, there continues to be a wide dispersion of total loss practices across our insurance carrier base. In some cases, because of our own customers perceived differences of their policyholder preferences. So I think there is long-standing conventional wisdom among some folks that drivers and owners prefer to have their cars back, they will repair insurance companies will sponsor repairs of cars that they economically should not. So that behavior does continue in the industry. And as a result, then we see a pretty wide dispersion of total loss practices across all carriers, though virtually all of them have increased total loss frequency over the long haul. As for your question about where total loss frequency would, can it exceed 30%? I think the answer is affirmatively yes. The economic value, meaning some carriers are there today. And others as used car values will -- even as used car value stabilized, repair costs divided by the value of cars has increased monotonically forever, and we expect that to continue as well. So total loss will increase in relative attractiveness because our auction liquidity, our global buyer base keeps driving the values of the damaged cars up while repair costs also rise. So the relative attractiveness of total loss will increase over time. Daniel Imbro : That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate all that color, Jeff. And then maybe one on the financials. Jeff, I know we shouldn't extrapolate any one quarter, is probably the answer, but it has been a multi-quarter trend of maybe accelerating G&A spend. So if we look back in that line item, can you maybe parse out what has been accelerating? And given it's a multi-quarter trend here, is it kind of a fair thing to extrapolate that there may be some things changed and that line the needs to keep growing at a faster rate? Jeff Liaw : I don't think the growth rate and Leah can comment here as well. Certainly, we are growing our capabilities. So the bringing on of new senior talent and the expansion of our offering in the whole car universe and frankly, our sophistication in the insurance world as well. Those all require new capabilities, and we are delighted to invest in them. So that reflects some of the G&A growth over time. That said, we continue to expect operating leverage over the medium-long term. But I think we always say, look, over multiple quarters to look over even most years for the right long-term trend. And I think the trend over time is that we invariably grow unit volume and revenue over the long haul, faster in many cases, meaningfully faster than we grow G&A. Leah Stearns : And from just an inclusion of Purple Wave, we did have about a little over $7.5 million related to the incremental consolidation of that business in the quarter, which was obviously not in the prior year period. Jeff Liaw : That's true. That's permanent. Leah Stearns : So that is permanent. But other than that, I would say everything else we're focused on is really to drive incremental operating leverage in the future. Daniel Imbro : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas Exane. Please proceed with your question. Ian Davis : This is Ian Davis on for Chris. Thanks a lot for taking our questions this evening. First, it seems you won business with a few larger accounts in the past year. How do you think about the cadence of market share wins from here? Do you feel you have the operational capacity to onboard more accounts if insurers want to make the switch? Or would this likely happen after the recent wins are fully transferred over with the business? Jeff Liaw : Got it. We don't comment on individual accounts, but to your broader question about our capacity to handle additional volume. We invest years ahead of the curve as reflected, of course, in capital expenditures over the course of the past 7 or 8 years. We invest ahead of the curve in the various geographies in which we do business. And so we would be delighted to serve new volume and certainly have the capacity to do so.  As you know, it's not even just the storage capacity itself. It's also the logistics capabilities trucking, both owned trucking assets as well as third-party assets, it's people and it's the scalable technology, auction platform and buyer base. And so to the answer more generically across all of those dimensions, it's absolutely yes. And the flywheel effect, frankly, applies to some of those dimensions, not just the auction dimension as well. For example, the stronger we become and the larger we become as a logistics company, the better access we have to both third-party and first-party transport capabilities, the better we are about deploying people to a storm and so on and so forth. So the answer is affirmatively yes. Ian Davis : Got it. That's helpful. And just one more, if I may. Ocean freight seem to be rising due to the conflict in the Middle East. Could you help us understand how rising ocean freight rates impact your business? We presume that international buyers in these markets would just bid less for the vehicles? Is that the right way to think about it? Are there any other impacts to consider? Jeff Liaw : In a word, yes, though, I think it's always worth commenting on what the relevant substitutes might be, right? So in so far as you're talking about ocean freight, the demand for mobility in these various countries, the countries that sell vehicles too, which is effectively every country in the world, but the growth tends to come from what we would characterize as developing economies and their demand for mobility is real and sustained and the growth is real and sustained. So the question becomes what their natural alternatives might be? And in many cases, they will still ultimately turn to Copart cars as a result. And then the last comment I'd make on that front is that, while ocean freight rates can rise I think it's still systemically naturally the case that ships mostly come to the U.S. or to the UK, for example, to our dominant origin markets. They come here full and they leave empty. So it's often the case that the backhaul legs are considerably cheaper. So the headline numbers may or may not be representative of our buyers' lived experience. Ian Davis : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on that shipping topic. Did you have any issues in the Red Sea due to the conflicts there? Jeff Liaw : No, not appreciably so. Craig Kennison : Thanks. And Leah, I wonder if you would expand on factors behind the resilience in your average selling price given the commentary relative to the Manheim Index. Leah Stearns : Sure. Absolutely. So just as our overall mix shifts within the underlying unit makeup of our business and what's selling through the Copart platform, that is one driver. So as you think about the increase in our unit volume coming from our Blue Car sellers, our dealer units, those are higher ASP units. But also as you think about used car pricing coming down and total frequency increasing, the incremental unit that is totaled by an insurance company is inherently a higher value unit, and that's because when total loss frequency came down as a result of rising used car prices that resulted in the underlying borderline units falling out of the mix, and those are now coming back. So as insurance companies are facing elevated repair costs, they're incrementally totaling the higher-value vehicles more frequently, and that's driving additional resilience within our ASP. Jeff Liaw : And then the -- I would offer also that it is the auction liquidity you've heard us speak about on a few occasions today as well. That as we -- as the platform grows, as we earn more Blue Cars, as the total volume of activity on the website grows, that draws more buyers, which has helped to sustain prices at levels well beyond what the Manheim Used Vehicle Index might reflect. Craig Kennison : That helps. And if I could sneak in one more, Jeff, on Purple Wave. Just curious if you've made any -- you've taken any initiatives since you've acquired a stake in that business and maybe highlight what those might be? Jeff Liaw : Fair question. We're very excited to have them as our partners in their arena, the leadership team there, Aaron, Susan McKee, and others are terrific. And so by and large, I think I described them as leading the charge with their customers, their community and so forth and doing a terrific job of it. So yes, we are finding ways to support one another efficiently, but it's principally about backing what we think is one of the very best teams in the industry. Craig Kennison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Good evening, guys. Could you talk a bit more about the international market as far as various country performance? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think we've seen strong unit volume really across all of our geographies. As you know, Brett, they are in various stages of maturity. The U.K. as a business, of course, looks a lot like ours. And they like ours here in the U.S., and as a result, we'd see the same total loss trends and with the results being driven in large part by the same factors we see here. In places like Germany and Spain, those, of course, are newer businesses for us. And so changes there are driven also by market share wins and conversions and so forth. So there are more local dynamics specific to those countries. But I think performance across the board has improved year-over-year. Bret Jordan : And then I guess in the Blue Car or just the noninsurance business in general, could you talk about the unit economics? Are you getting a better seller fee because you're not negotiating with a very large insurance company for high volume? Or as you're growing that business, do you charge a lower seller fee to get the volume? Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think for a host of reasons, Brett, we don't talk about the seller fees that we charge. We certainly endeavor to provide the specific type of value is requested by a given seller and the range of service varies tremendously, even among sellers within a specific seller type. Even among insurance companies, we perform a very wide range of services for folks and different portfolios for each. And the same is true on the non-insurance side as well. As for the unit economics they -- we tend to do well in those domains because the ASPs are high, but they are also, in some cases, higher touch and more transactional by nature, as you've heard us comment on in the past. There's something very scalable about a large insurance company with whom we have elegant B2B integrations and so forth that tends to be less true among the smaller sellers. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good evening and good afternoon. This is Josh on for Ryan Brinkman. Thanks for taking our question. Just maybe the first question on capital allocation. Could you maybe share your latest thoughts around capital allocation and how you're thinking about capacity expansion and category diversification into 2024? Thanks, and then I have a follow-up. Leah Stearns : Sure. I'll touch on capital allocation, and Jeff can jump in. Just from an overall allocation perspective, we do focus our priority from the top of the list for our core business. So we are constantly focused on adding capacity, the ability to serve cats. From a cost perspective, we're managing our yard distribution to ensure that we have optimal positioning from a cost perspective for [indiscernible]. So investing in real estate, investing in our logistics capabilities and ultimately, our technology platform to serve our customers is our number one priority from a capital allocation perspective. Beyond that, we do look at expanding geographically. We look at complementary adjacencies as we expanded with Purple Wave earlier this year. And from an overall corporate development perspective, we do find ourselves with lots of opportunities to assess potential targets. However, we have a very high threshold for how we think about generating returns long term. And we have an incredible track record and we endeavor to continue to perform along those lines. And so for us, we remain incredibly patient on the capital allocation front as it relates to deploying capital through M&A and through investments. We do seek to enter into partnerships with complementary companies that can serve our customers alongside us in a very efficient fashion. And so we've done that with folks at companies like Hi Marley, where we've endeavored to solve problems for our customers that collectively we can do more efficiently together than we can do alone. And then ultimately, historically, to the extent we had excess cash, we have leveraged the share repurchase program, but have done so very opportunity. And so going back to my prior comments, I would just point you to, we remain incredibly disciplined and very patient. And we'll act when we see tremendous value to create on behalf of shareholders. Jeff Liaw : The one after thought I'd offer is that our capitalization with our clients is a distinctive competitive advantage. Our conservative balance sheet, our net cash balance equips us such that we can be patient even through a crisis. So in the midst of a pandemic when nobody knew for how long driving an economic activity would be shut down. We were able to continue our business as it stands today. We didn't lay off folks. We didn't suspend CapEx, et cetera.  Our insurance clients have a long memory, and they know those things. They know that when land is available for us to acquire so that we can preserve it for the industry's use for the next 50 years then we'll do so gladly and proudly despite it, of course, coming with big ticket prices as well. So the point there is that capital allocation is not a subject in isolation. It's also a commercial matter that affects how we interact with our customers as well. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. That's very helpful color. As a follow-up, maybe would you be able to share any on-ground trends that you were seeing from the recent floods in California? And if you could just give us any color on the potential profitability impact that it could have in the third quarter? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think we were all struck of course, by unusual weather patterns in California relative to, I think, what we would all agree is long-standing history in the state. We are well equipped there with, again, land, trucks, personnel technology, et cetera, to respond to events as they emerge. To date, we haven't yet observed events of anything near the magnitude of Ian, Ida, et cetera, as we experienced in the Northeast in Florida, in Texas, Louisiana, et cetera. We're ready for it and should the weather evolve in a manner that the activity becomes very elevated. And on a sustained basis, you'll see us continue to invest in that as well. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thanks for taking my questions. And good luck. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Great. Thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you after the third quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before turning the call over to management, I will share Copart's Safe Harbor statement. The company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2023, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Good evening, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this evening. We're pleased to report our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. I'll provide some brief comments about the business before handing the call to Leah to review our financial results, and then she and I will take your questions. First, turning to our Insurance business. We have recently concluded our 24th Annual U.S. Insurance Advisory Board Meeting in New York City. Every year, we gather in-person to solicit feedback from our clients about the opportunities and challenges they face, which in turn inform our service offerings, tech deployments and capital investment programs. Some of the priorities we addressed this year included a range of levers available to them to address escalating claims cycle times and advance charges in particular. We discussed at length our best-in-class auction liquidity fueled by our exclusively online marketplace, which itself has been refined repeatedly, since its launch in 2003. Our uniquely global buyer base and the auction intelligence that results from the application of machine learning tools to the data from literally billions of interactions with sellers and members that correspond with tens of millions of vehicles sold. And in the spirit of our shared success, we hosted this event to coincide with the celebration of our 30th anniversary as a public company and together with our clients, we rang the NASDAQ opening bell. We continue to grow our business with our insurance clients. As anticipated, new and used vehicle prices have decreased somewhat steeply in recent days, while repair costs remain elevated, driving a strong and continued recovery in total loss frequency. During our third fiscal quarter, we observed a 14% year-over-year decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. And though ISS Fast Track reported a slight softening in accident severity of 1.3% or so for the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, accident severity is still up almost 9% when compared to the same quarter two years prior. The combination of these two forces decreasing used vehicle values and elevated repair costs due to vehicle complexity and labor challenges in the repair industry has driven a recovery in total loss frequency back to pre-pandemic levels. According to CCC, total loss frequency for the first calendar quarter 2024 was 21.1% across all loss categories, up approximately 150 basis points versus the same time a year ago. We believe that, long run trends continue to make repairing vehicles less economically attractive to insurance carriers and totaling vehicles more economically attractive to them and the total loss frequency will continue its steady long-term path upwards. Our U.S. insurance volumes increased 6.8% year-over-year as we have lapsed the effects of units from Hurricane Ian a year ago. Given the increasing frequency and magnitude of storm related activity, we're somewhat hesitant to provide, quote, normalized growth trends that exclude the effect of storms. But it was a modest reduction in year-over-year growth as a result of the Ian vehicles sold a year ago. And then to the theme more generally of our response to catastrophic events. We responded to multiple smaller weather events so far this year and last, they did not in the aggregate approach the magnitude of major catastrophic events like Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Harvey. Nonetheless, these comparatively smaller storms affect communities across the United States, including floods in the Houston area and Tornado outbreaks in the central plains. Our investments into our catastrophic team and infrastructure have allowed us to respond efficiently to our customer's needs throughout these events and underscore our contributions to promoting resilience for the communities we serve in the face of evolving climate change trends. We note also that major research groups are predicting a serious storm season ahead, predicting as many as 31 named storms in 2024, and an increase of over 50% year-over-year. As a result, our focus remains on our proactive preparedness, investing in our teams on the ground, our logistics technology, our fleet of vehicles, and of course our dedicated acreage reserve for handling the peak capacity needs to come with major events. On a similar note, outside the United States, we're leveraging our catastrophic response capabilities to support our clients in Southern Brazil and in the Persian Gulf who continue to experience the effects of ongoing historical flooding. I'll pause for a minute on our non-insurance business as well. We continue to grow our blue car business, which serves our bank and finance fleet and rental segment partners. In the third fiscal quarter, we observed year-over-year growth of 23% to almost 24%. Likewise, our dealer sales volume, a combination of our Copart dealer services business unit and NPA, our power sports auction platform. Increased unit volume sold by almost 18%, all told our U.S. non-insurance, automotive and dealer volume, excluding low value and wholesale units increased 19% year-over-year. Our growth is the result of our commitment to customer service and our auction liquidity. With each additional vehicle, we earn the right to sell. We increase the attractiveness of our auction platform to the world's automotive buyers, drawing still more members to our auctions and to the benefit of all of our sellers, new and old. I'll conclude with a reflection, brief reflection on our first 30 years as a publicly traded company. Perhaps the single most distinctive characteristic of Copart today is our investment horizon. Even as we celebrate our 30th anniversary, our minds quickly shift to the work ahead of us to ensure a prosperous celebration with our clients of our 40th, 50th, and 60th as well. We'll continue to invest as we always have in our people, our technology and our real estate to deliver excellent results to our clients worldwide. And with that, I'll turn it over to Leah, our CFO. Leah Stearns : Thank you, Jeff. I'll begin with our third quarter sales trends. During the quarter, our global unit sales increased over 11%, including the modest benefit of the consolidation of Purple Wave. While inventory increased 4% from the year ago period, this growth was a function of a partial recovery and total loss frequency and share gains. Focusing on our U.S. business unit growth was over 9%, which reflected fee unit growth of over 9% and purchase unit growth of over 17%. Consignment or fee units continue to constitute the vast majority of our U.S. unit volume. Insurance unit volume increased about 7% year-over-year. As Jeff mentioned, our non-insurance unit volume growth has continued to outpace out of our insurance business. This volume growth substantially came from dealer units, which increased nearly 18% in fleet rental and finance units, which increased over 23%. Inventory levels in the U.S. increased over 3% in quarter and over 5% when excluding low value in cat units. Turning to our international business, we saw unit growth of over 21% with fee units increasing nearly 21% and purchase units increasing by over 24%. Our international business ended the quarter with inventory levels over 7% ahead of prior year. For the quarter, global ASPs declined by about 3% from the year ago period. With U.S. Insurance ASPs down less than 2% and international ASPs down about 5%. Overall, our ASPs continue to show resilience compared to the nearly 14% year-over-year decrease in the Manheim Used Vehicle price index. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter, global revenue increased to $1.13 billion, representing growth of over $105 million or about 10%. Global service revenue increased nearly $100 million or almost 12% for the third quarter, primarily due to increased volume. U.S. service revenue grew by over 10%, and international service revenue grew by nearly 22% for the quarter. Global purchase vehicle sales for the third quarter increased $6 million or 3.5%, and global purchase vehicle gross profit increased by over $2 million or over 17%. In the U.S. our purchased vehicle revenue was up nearly $7 million or 8%, while gross profit increased less than $1 million or almost 3%. This trend was primarily due to a mixed shift towards lower ASP units in the U.S. Internationally purchased vehicle revenue decreased by less than $1 million or almost 1%, while gross profit increased by over $2 million or about 29%. These results were primarily driven by significantly higher margins on purchase units in Germany. Global gross profit increase to more than $525 million, an increase of over $42 million or about 9%, and our gross margin percentage decreased approximately 70 basis points to 46.6%. In the U.S. our gross profit margin decreased to 50.9% with DNA being the most impactful driver of margin compression. As we continue to focus on investments in our yard infrastructure and technology and our international gross profit margin increased to 27.6%. Turning to general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation spend in the quarter was $76 million, reflecting an increase of more than $23 million and less than $4 million on a sequential basis. As we've highlighted over the past quarter, our year-over-year, G&A increase continues to reflect our investments in our sales marketing product and technology functions. The financial consolidation of Purple Wave into our results as well as an increase in third-party related projects. This increase includes two key system implementations, which we kicked off during the quarter relating to our finance and HR functions. We expect these investments will result in more scalable processes and systems and provide us with a greater operating leverage over the long-term. Finally, GAAP operating income increased by over 4% to $437 million and third quarter GAAP net income increased by over 9% to $382 million or $0.39 per diluted common share. During the quarter, we benefited from over $18 million of incremental interest income as we have actively invested our cash into treasury securities as well as a lower effective tax rate of 19.1%. Turning to our capital structure, as of the end of April, we had $4.3 billion of liquidity, which is comprised of nearly $3.1 billion in cash and investments and held to maturity securities and our capacity under our revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. We believe that, our conservative capitalization is a distinct competitive advantage in our industry, empowering us to operate our business with a horizon that prioritizes long-term success for both ourselves and our clients. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of over $496 million and $408 million of free cash flow. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were about $88 million with nearly all of our investments attributable to expanding our real estate and physical infrastructure to enhance capacity, while simultaneously reducing our transportation costs and corresponding fuel consumption. As I've highlighted in the past, we expect our capital allocation strategy will enable Copart to focus entirely on delivering outstanding products and services. To further this objective over the last 12 months, we have deployed over $540 million into our real estate portfolio, fleet and technology. Today, our global portfolio of approximately 19,000 acres of outdoor vehicle storage, a robust fleet of transportation assets and more than two decades of virtual auction technology development are the foundation of what truly differentiates Copart. With that, Jeff and I would be happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Bob Labick : I want to start with the question about dealer cars in general. Obviously, a lot of success there. But just as a little context, we've talked on previous calls about the dropping used car value to Manheim Index and the impact on rising total loss frequency and the fact that your salvage ASPs have held up because the incremental salvage car going into being total is the higher end car. The question is, what's the relationship for Copart and your dealer car ASPs as used car values are dropping, if any? Jeff Liaw : Bob, I think it's a fair question. I think there are some the natural effects, I think every auto auction business will encounter conversion implications as well, but as seller expectations begin to align better with current market conditions, conversion is very high in rising price environments. By and large, we don't generally experience those except but for 2021, 2022 when we saw very rapid increases in used vehicle prices, that generally speaking is not the long-term trend. But there are some modest effects in the near-term, but I think overwhelmed by the unit volume implications. The selling prices are somewhat softer for the dealer cars because for the same basket of cars, they certainly would sell for less than they would have a year ago. But as we deliver excellent results, that total loss frequency rises and the relevant aperture, the relevant window of cars that we can address well for our dealers continues to expand. That has a natural the total loss frequency effects do have some secondary effects on dealer cards as well for the same reason. Bob Labick : Okay, great. And then I guess just in general, so you just mentioned that part. The other, how are ASPs trending all else equal? In other words, if total loss frequently or if Manheim was flat year-over-year right now, you guys have obviously pushed more into dealer, you've added arbitration and inspection and at certain points. And has your, have your ASPs been going up over time or what have been the trends if you were to level set, kind of the Manheim index to Copart dealer ASPs? Leah Stearns : So, Bob, I think Manheim is down about 14% year-over-year. Our dealer units are down just a little over 5%. I think that's, to Jeff's point, there is a mixed shift going on within that population. As we're adding higher value units, we aren't exposed to the same type of overall headwinds that the broader used vehicle index is. Because we're naturally growing into the higher ASP buckets. Jeff Liaw : And Bob, I'd say in both directions, the Manheim used Vehicle index, you followed us long enough to know it's never been a perfectly linear predictor of outcomes at Copart auctions. I think over the very long haul, our ASP performance has generally outpaced Manheim for the reasons you mentioned a moment ago. Total loss, frequency rising improving the quality of cars that we sell and our mix, our growth among the non-insurance segment doing the same. But even then, we have our use, our prices have certainly decreased less than Manheim has over the same comparable period. But that's misalignment of the two metrics has always been true. Bob Labick : And the last one for me and just, uh, finishing up on dealer car for now. Where are, you're obviously taking share, we don't see any other numbers as strong as that. So where is the growth coming from? Is it from physical auctions or is it from like the wholesale market, meaning you're actually growing the auction market, so to speak, these cars weren't going to be auctioned before they were just kind of by a wholesaler and behind the scenes and you're getting those cars, or where do you view the growth of your dealer cars most coming from? Jeff Liaw : I think you accurately the universe of competitors for the vehicles that we sell. So the insurance world, I think is unique. But as for the cars we sell on behalf of other parties, they also have, they have many different outlets. And depending on who you're talking about, a dealer can certainly sell the car at his or her lot can sell through the other online channels you're aware of, can sell at physical auction as well, and can sell to wholesalers to take principal positions in those vehicles. Financial institutions have a different set of possibilities afforded to them. They, by and large don't hand sell as you know, rental car companies in some cases operate their own quasi retail sites from which they sell vehicles directly. Some will use the other major auction houses you're aware of. So the competitive landscape is multidimensional for our non-insurance cars for sure. And I think we are competing effectively, but again to different folks for different types of sellers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Chris Bottiglieri : Two high level questions for you. I'll start with the first one. So Jeff, in the past you've talked about how much higher total loss rates could be if insurers had full access end-to-end access to data. So I'm curious, just given some of the advancements in AI, like you spoke to that conference and some of more, more recent executive hires, like how much closer are you on that path to better monetizing that data and driving better total loss rate decisions? Jeff Liaw : Yes, a great question. I think we're still, and perhaps to provide some additional context on the -- on historical commentary on this front, we think there is, the historical trend of total loss. Frequency increasing over time will assuredly continue over the long haul. Total loss frequency in 1980 was 4%, 10 years later it was 5%, in 1990, and today it's 21%. So I think there's a pretty clear monotonic increase of total loss frequency over the long haul that we continue to observe. As for a snapshot today, we note very different total loss practices across even insurance companies, even for like vehicles. And so the dispersion of practices today indicates that there are insurance companies who are leaving money on the table, by repairing cars. They arguably shouldn't in the form of certainly delayed and extended rental car, rentals they're paying for as well as the repairs and the supplements themselves. And as you noted, we have offered and continue to offer a range of tools to them to allow them to expedite their decision-making to make total loss decisions faster and to make total loss decisions better. But as for true full integration of those tools, truly individual car total loss decisions, as opposed to general rules of thumb, it's easier for any insurance company to say if the repair estimate exceeds X percent of the intact value, you total it. If it is less than that, you don't, but in practice, you're actually better off making individual vehicle decisions. But as for the industry overall, that more enlightened data informed decision early, I think there remains tremendous potential on that front. So besides the historical trend lifting, total loss frequency overall up, even snapshot today of circumstances were never to change. If market circumstances were never to change, there still remains abundant opportunities to make decisions better and faster for insurance companies. Chris Bottiglieri : And then my second big picture question is on international mix. I think it's been a couple years since you've commented. Where that sits at the last I recall was 50% to 55%. I just think given the lack of global vehicle production, I would think emerging markets, international buyers probably face even tighter supply than we face here in the U.S. So just curious if that's caused any shift in demand towards international, if you've seen that in your business at all? Jeff Liaw : Yes, so I think the international buyer, with each passing year becomes a more prominent and more important a portion of our member base and buyer base. And during our meeting with our insurance clients, we underscored for them and quantified for them just how important they were. I think it's safe to say that, but for the very lowest value vehicles that are, that aren't even towed a hundred miles to say nothing of being brought overseas to Eastern Europe or to South America, but for those vehicles, international bidders are instrumental in driving the value of every car sold at Copart. So they today speak for a majority of the value of U.S. auctions, literally as buyers. And by the time you incorporate those, international bidding activity for cars they buy or for cars for which they are the push bid, meaning the second high bid, which in some intellectual respect really dictates the selling price of the car or participate, that the auction itself driving further bidding activity that's approaching 90% of the cars we sell. But the international buyer is, is instrumental and we'll make it a point to better highlight that on subsequent calls as well. But they are incredibly important and more important today than they were five years ago, and they will be more important five years from now than they are today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alice Wycklendt with Baird. Alice Wycklendt : Yes, thanks for taking my questions Alice on for Craig today. Maybe just thinking high-level about inflation in the insurance industry. I mean rates are up materially for everyone. Curious what your take is on any downstream implications, be it, more uninsured motorists, pressure on you to provide additional services, maybe it's good for the total loss rate. How do you think about any of those potential trends? Jeff Liaw : Presuming your question is principally U.S. centric, the uninsured motorist ratio is vary tremendously by market. For example, it won't surprise you. They're considerably higher for us in Brazil than they are in the U.S. or the UK, for example. But for any given market, the uninsured motorist ratio, I think is a function, yes, of rates, which in turn are a lagged byproduct of inflation. Many of our insurance clients I think are just now in recent quarters achieving the rate relief that comes with state level approvals for changes they wanted to make, which then in turn correspond with inflated costs on repairs and personnel and so forth that you noted, that you observed a moment ago. I don't think it will have a meaningful appreciable effect in the U.S. Perhaps, you'll see some trends to liability only coverage instead of collision and comprehensive or what have you. But I think those effects would be on the margin. In the end, the economic decision, once a car has been meaningfully impaired, functions have been meaningfully impaired in an accident, whether there's an insurance -- it certainly helps expedite matters to have an insurance company mediating the resolution of that car. But if it makes economic sense to total it, it eventually will be totaled regardless. Alice Wycklendt : Makes sense. Thanks for that. And then just a high level on the insurance side again, I mean, for a variety of reasons, you've gained share with insurance carriers over the years. Maybe again, high level, talk about the catalyst for those share shifts and maybe how sticky you consider those business wins to be? Jeff Liaw : Got it. No, I appreciate that. We've described addressed that question, but happy to do so again. I think our advantages with our clients are, first, to drive better auction outcomes. I've mentioned that, the auction liquidity, our international buyer base, the technology platform, the machine-learning enabled tools that allow us to drive better returns at auction. Ultimately, our insurance clients are, of course, economically motivated. They have to achieve the best possible cost outcomes they can to ensure the best possible combined ratios to ensure that, they're competitive in turn on rates and that they can protect and grow their businesses accordingly. We believe that, we generate superior returns at auction and that that has been persuasive to many of our insurance clients. The second element of what we do is to manage cars quickly. Cycle times are by their nature very positively correlated with costs for insurance companies in particular on the front end. Our ability to retrieve vehicles quickly reduces their advance charges. It would surprise you how many cars that are very clearly eventually bound for a total loss auction like Copart are nonetheless subject to $2,000, $3,000 of advance charges, tear downs and estimates and partial repairs or what have you before the car is ultimately disposed of. Our ability to help insurance companies to reduce those front-end cycle times is very economically meaningful to them as well. We've talked before about catastrophic events. Memories in some cases are short, sometimes long, but we distinguish ourselves in a moment of crisis. The storms like Harvey, Ian and Ida are acute cost events and perhaps more importantly, acute policyholder service events for the insurance companies as well. Our ability to support them, to support the communities, to be their ambassadors effectively on the ground in places like Florida and the Northeast, in turn equipped by the land we've acquired literally 100 of acres of idle capacity that stands ready to serve them in a storm as well as the communications technology, our own fleet of vehicles, our Copart Catastrophic Response Team, the folks that we deploy upon a moment's notice that's distinctive as well. So those are, I've talked about a few other elements, but those are three meaningful ones. As to durability, in general, when we are able to earn the trust of our clients, we run through walls to preserve that over the long haul. So in general, those relationships have proven durable, but we never take it for granted. We wake up each morning committed to delivering better today than we did yesterday this year than we did the year before. So it has been durable in the past, but we never assume it will be forever. We'll make sure that we earn the right to serve them for with each passing year. Alice Wycklendt : And then if I may one more just switching gears to Purple Wave. Maybe just update us with a little more detail on how things have progressed there now with a couple quarters of that, that partnership underway. What are the biggest areas of opportunity you're seeing and maybe what are some of the key trends in that market that you're observing so far? Jeff Liaw : Sure. Purple Wave we're delighted to have Aaron and Suzy and the team on board. I think we noted that last quarter as well. They continue to grow GMV very well year-over-year. The growth opportunities for them include both geographic expansion. Certainly they were at the time of our investment in Purple Wave, principally central time zone oriented, but they continue to expand their footprint from there. Aaron and Suzy have done an extraordinary job building, what they would call the community of buyers and sellers at Purple Wave. And they continue to invest in their capabilities there. So even within the markets in which they're currently participating, there remain growth opportunities to bring on new sellers, to bring on additional equipment for existing sellers. So, I think it's across the board. They are still early enough in their journey and we are early enough in our journey with them, there remain growth levers across all of those dimensions. And frankly, the key management challenge, the key leadership challenge for Aaron and Suzy is to figure out how to prioritize among them. But the growth trends have been very promising there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jeffries. Bret Jordan : Following up on that last question on Purple Wave, is your foreign buyer base, is it, does that differentiate your ability to sell the commercial equipment? Are they buyers of what Purple Wave is selling? Jeff Liaw : Yes, that's a, a good question. And I probably would draw a distinction still between the commercial, because we do sell a lot of commercial equipment box trucks, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, and the like from Copart cover, which is by and large the result of our serving insurance companies. They have as part of their book of their portfolio, a number of assets of that type. So we sell many assets on their behalf and certainly for them, the international buyer is deeply relevant. Purple Wave historically has been principally a domestic oriented platform because their assets have been sold by and large in place historically. So they would sell on behalf of a rental company, an agricultural concern or an industrial one they would sell in place. And so by and large, they have been more domestically oriented in the past. Over the long haul, looking forward, that can become a, a more international business as well. But that's been the, the historical approach. Bret Jordan : And the question of international, I mean, 21% growth, are you seeing, it looks like sequential improvement, is that traction in Europe? You called out flooding in Brazil and CAT events in the Middle East, but what's the big driver of international and are you getting traction in some of those bigger vehicle markets like the EU? Jeff Liaw : Fair question. I think we we're experiencing growth in international. As you know, Bret, it's such a all-inclusive notion in life is, is quite a bit more complicated than that. But we have grown in all of our major countries or certainly from memory in Canada, in Brazil, in the UK, in the Middle East for that matter, and in Germany and Spain as well. So for different reasons though, in the UK I think it is, for example, total loss frequency and the like. In Brazil, it's that as well. There's certain, some flood act, early flood activity there. But the international arena growing for a combination of total loss frequency, market penetration as you noted a moment ago. Not a step function change, but meaningful growth across these countries. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jash Patwa with JPMorgan. Jash Patwa : Just wondering if you could share some insights on your experience so far in moving towards the higher value units within the dealer segment that you highlighted previously? I believe there were some initiatives underway in developing the buyer base, the condition reporting inspection and arbitration procedures for the whole car segment. And wondering if you can share an update on how that has progressed so far? Thanks, and I have a follow-up. Jeff Liaw : Great. Yes. So as you noted, it has been an area of emphasis for us for years, of course to serve the Copart dealer network better over time so that more of their cars are addressable by Copart auctions. There is the natural tailwind, as we discussed earlier today of total loss frequency, bringing better cars into our network to begin with from insurance companies, which in turn brings the buyers that are relevant for an expanding portfolio of dealer cars as well. You asked a good question about the relevant range of services that we need to provide to those sellers which in some cases are more extensive or they're different. Frankly, the range of services provided to insurance companies for salvage cars is certainly robust as well, but in many cases different. It is more like loan settlement, title procurement, salvage title issuance, a range of different things provided to them in comparison to dealer cars and frankly rental cars, financial institution vehicles and the like. So yes, we continue to evaluate the range of services we provide, continue to test, a range of these things to expand so that we can better serve them. Yes, that's very much a priority. Jash Patwa : That's very helpful color. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, just wanted to get your thoughts around, how we should be thinking about the OpEx cadence over the next 12 to 18 months. Just trying to get a sense of whether the bulk of the investments are in the base today, or, if we should start to see, if we should continue to see, somewhat of a meaningful uptick in operating expenses in the coming few quarters? Jeff Liaw : Yes. And to clarify, when by operating expenses, do you mean, the gross level or you mean general administrator, or do you mean both? Jash Patwa : I was referring to the general administrator expenses primarily. Jeff Liaw : Yes. I think that, over the long haul, I think you probably followed us for a while, you'll know we have almost always achieved operating leverage relative to G&A growth or we happened to in the last few quarters of experienced more meaningful year-over-year growth for the reasons that Leah described a moment ago. The very long-term horizon we expect to grow operating income, to grow gross profits in excess of the rate of growth of OpEx or G&A, OpEx as you described at G&A as we do. But on any given quarter, any given month, quarter, frankly even year, that's not necessarily the priority for us. We want to make sure we achieve the right long-term outcomes. If that requires short-term investments, if that requires long-term investments, we are happy to make it. As you know, as a rule, we don't provide forward-looking guidance, but we continue to spend these resources very prudently. We take our responsibilities as stewards of capital very seriously and we'll invest those dollars when it makes sense to generate the right long-term returns for Copart and when they don't, we won't. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Liaw for closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, everybody. We'll talk to you next quarter. Have a good night. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before turning the call over to management, I will share Copart's Safe Harbor statement. The company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2023, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you, Owen and good evening. We're pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 and the conclusion of another successful fiscal year for our customers and for Copart. I'll begin with a few comments on our business before handing the call to Leah to review our financial results in greater detail. And then she and I will take your questions. Turning first to the Insurance industry. We continue to grow our business with insurance sellers of 6% year-over-year, a reflection of our compelling and growing service offerings and industry-leading auction liquidity. The recent decline in used vehicle values, in particular, has driven total loss frequency upwards back in line with pre-pandemic historical norms. During our fourth fiscal quarter 2024, we observed an 8.6% year-over-year decline in the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. As Leah will more fully describe later in her comments, our insurance company's selling prices significantly outpaced those of the broader used vehicle market. All indications are that the long-term trends in the repair industry towards increasing vehicle complexity, as measured, for example, by the average number of parts to repair a vehicle as well as rising labor rates continue to tip the scales in favor of totaling vehicles rather than repairing them. In fact, that's 21.4% for the second calendar quarter of 2024. Total loss frequency is some 200 basis points higher than for the same 3-month period a year ago. This, of course, is itself a blended average. Some of our customers total vehicles at rates significantly higher still. We continue to observe an ever-increasing economic incentive for insurance carriers to total vehicles rather than repair them, a long-term trend we firmly believe will continue. Today, we offer a range of sophisticated tools to our insurance clients to assist them with optimizing these decisions. Another theme I'd like to highlight is the deepening of our relationships with our insurance company clients. As reflected recently in the ongoing expansion of our Title Express service offering. Historically, auction houses like ours have obtained salvage certificates from the states in which we do business after the insurance companies have first obtained the original title, either directly from policyholders if they own their cars outright or from lenders if the vehicles have liens outstanding. Insurance companies have always reasoned that for a pivotal touch point with their own customers, typically after a claims event, it would be best to keep this function in-house. Today, however, our offer of an integrated one-stop solution for title procurement, which we call Title Express, has achieved substantial traction in the industry. On behalf of our carrier clients, we obtain original titles from policyholders and from lenders. Each state has its specific nuances in what it requires as documentation, signatures, secured forms, powers of attorney, and so forth. And each lender, too, has its own requirements for the provision of payoff balances and per diems and the releasing of liens and titles. The lender universe in particular is an especially fragmented constituency. Between our online lender portal, AI-powered outbound calling systems and access to other intermediaries, we believe we offer a substantially more efficient title procurement process than our insurance customers can otherwise achieve. Today, we're pleased to note that we are approaching a run rate of 1 million titles obtained per year on behalf of our insurance clients, a testament to their trust in us to provide excellent service to them and, importantly, to their own customers as well. One additional note on the Insurance industry regarding the storm season of 2024. As anticipated by many, the 2024 storm season is off to an active start relative to other seasons in recent years. Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Cat 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, caused widespread damage across Texas, Louisiana, and neighboring states. Though, the storm's path fortuitously bypassed major population centers. Other named storms of this season, including Hurricanes Debby and Ernesto, have required significant mobilization of resources on our part, which we are happy to undertake on behalf of our insurance clients. I'll turn our attention to our non-insurance sellers as well. We've continued to grow our volume with them, leveraging our core capabilities in having physical storage capacity via our real estate portfolio, a strong network of logistics solutions, and a global liquid buyer base. We continue to grow our blue car business, which serves our bank and finance, fleet and rental segment partners. In the fourth quarter, we observed year-over-year volume growth of 20.4% in compares to a year ago. Likewise, our dealer sales volume, a combination of our Copart dealer services business and MPA, our power sports auction platform, increased volume sold by 9.5% year-over-year as well. Excluding our low value and wholesale units, a customary measure we provide, our U.S. non-insurance automotive volume increased 12.6% year-over-year. We view our growth among these non-insurance sellers as attractive not only for the economic benefit that these incremental units provide to our business, but also as a critical factor in sustaining and extending the liquidity advantage of our auctions. We have seen abundant examples of first time buyers attending Copart auctions in pursuit of a vehicle we sell on behalf of a rental car company or a financial institution, only to then begin purchasing vehicles from insurance companies thereafter. As total loss frequency rises and insurance companies elect to total ever more drivable vehicles, the power of the crossover buyer will only grow. We're committed to investing our time and our resources to cultivate this aspect of our business. This, in a nutshell, is the flywheel effect you've heard us talk about at length in the past. Finally, as an additional note, our partner in the equipment arena Purple Wave, led by Aaron and Suzy McKee and their team based in Manhattan, Kansas, drove 17% year-over-year growth for the full year -- for the full fiscal year, outpacing industry growth in the equipment auction markets they serve. We're excited about what the future holds for our partnership with them. With that, I'll turn it over to Leah for her comments on the financials. Leah Stearns : Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin with our fourth quarter and fiscal year '24 sales trend. During the quarter, our global unit sales and inventory increased 8% and about 7% respectively from the year ago period. For fiscal year '24, global unit sales increased nearly 10%. This growth was a function of an increase in total loss frequency and share gain. Focusing on our U.S. business, unit growth was over 6% which reflected fee unit growth of over 6% and purchase unit growth of over 13%. For fiscal year '24, unit growth was nearly 8% with fee units growing over 7% and purchase unit growth of almost 14%. Consignment or fee units continue to constitute the vast majority of our U.S unit volume. Our U.S unit volume increased 6 -- our U.S insurance unit volume increased 6% year-over-year and about 7% for fiscal year '24. As Jeff mentioned, our non-insurance unit volume growth has continued to outpace that of our insurance business. This volume growth substantially came from fleet rental and finance units which increased over 20% in Q4 and nearly 28% for the year and dealer units which increased nearly 10% for the quarter and over 15% for the fiscal year '24. Inventory levels in the U.S increased over 6% and nearly 9% when excluding low value and cat units. Turning to our international business, we saw unit growth of almost 17% in the quarter and 21% for fiscal year '24, with fee units increasing over 17% in Q4 and 22% for the year. Purchase units increased by nearly 13% for the quarter and almost 16% for the fiscal year. Our international business ended the quarter with inventory levels over 9% ahead of the prior year. Global ASPs declined by approximately 5% for the quarter relative to a year ago period and about 3% for the full year. Our U.S ASPs continue to show resilience and are significantly outperforming the used vehicle market more broadly. While the Manheim Used Vehicle Price Index declined by nearly 9% from the year ago quarter and almost 2% sequentially, our U.S insurance ASPs declined less than 4% from a year-ago for the quarter and increased over 2% sequentially. Turning to our financial results. Global revenue in the quarter increased to nearly $1.1 billion representing growth of over $71 million or about 7%. For the year, global revenue increased to more than $4.2 billion representing growth of over $367 million or nearly 10%. Global service revenue increased nearly $59 million or over 7% for the fourth quarter and almost $363 million or over 11% for the fiscal year, primarily due to increased volume. Our U.S. service revenue grew by over 6% for the quarter and 10% for the year and international service revenue grew by nearly 14% for the fourth quarter and 22% for the year. Global purchase vehicle sales for the fourth quarter increased over 12 million or 8% and over 4 million or about 1% for the fiscal year. Global purchase vehicle gross profit decreased by about 1% in the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year. In the U.S., purchase vehicle revenue was up over $10 million or 12%, while purchase vehicle gross profit increased less than $1 million or about 11% in the quarter. And for the fiscal year, purchase vehicle revenue decreased about $9 million or almost 3%, and purchase vehicle gross profit increased about $4 million or over 18%. Internationally, purchased vehicle revenue increased by over $2 million or about 3% and gross profit decreased by almost a $1 million or about 11% in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, purchased vehicle revenue increased almost $14 million or over 4% and purchased vehicle gross profit decreased about $4 million or over 12%. Global yard operations cost, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation expense increased about $59 million or about 17% from the prior year period. This growth reflects the increase in unit volume as well as approximately $16 million of non-recurring expenses primarily related to operating taxes. In addition, as Jeff noted, given the active and early start to the storm season in 2024, our CAT storm response teams incurred seasonally higher costs preparing and positioning resources for several storms which did not produce significant unit volumes. Given the unpredictable nature of catastrophic events during storm season, we absorbed these costs as part of our normal course of serving our customers and their policyholders. During the quarter, global growth profit was over $453 million, a decrease of $4 million or about 1%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 340 basis points to 42.4% in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, global gross profit was over $1.9 billion, an increase of over $170 million or about 10%, and gross margin percentage was 45%, an increase of about 10 basis points. In the U.S., our gross profit margin decreased to 46.5% for the quarter and increased to 49.4% for the year. The key drivers of margin compression during the quarter included the impact of nearly $12 million of out-of-period expenses as well as increased salary and benefits expense associated with our yard operations personnel. Our international gross profit margin increased to 24.2% in the quarter and 25.5% for the year. Turning to general and administrative expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, spend in the quarter was about $81 million, reflecting an increase of $26 million over the prior year and about $5 million on a sequential basis. For the year, spend was about $288 million, an increase of about $88 million. As we highlighted last quarter, our year-over-year G&A increase continues to reflect our investments in organic product development, our platform functions, the financial consolidation of Purple Wave into our results, as well as an increase in third-party project-related costs associated with system implementations. Across our organization and as we are investing in expanding our whole car and heavy equipment sales functions, our teams are simultaneously focused on deploying emerging technologies to enhance our business processes and systems in pursuit of scalability and operating leverage over the long-term. GAAP operating income for the quarter decreased by 8% to over $359 million and for the fiscal year GAAP operating income decreased -- sorry, GAAP operating income increased by over $85 million or nearly 6%. Finally, fourth quarter GAAP net income decreased by over 7% to over $322 million or $0.33 per diluted common share. For the fiscal year, GAAP net income increased by over 10% to over $1.4 billion. During the quarter, we benefited from over $14 million of incremental interest income as we have actively invested our cash into Treasury Securities. And for the quarter, our tax rate was 21.1%, and for the fiscal year, it was 20.5%. Turning to our capital structure, as of the end of July, we had over $4.6 billion of liquidity, which is a compromise of nearly $3.4 billion in cash and investments in health maturity securities and our capacity under a revolving credit facility of over $1.2 billion. We believe that our conservative capitalization is a distinct competitive advantage in our industry enabling us to operate our business with a horizon that prioritizes ours and our clients' long-term success. For the year, we generated free cash flow of $962 million reflecting our operating cash flow generation of $1.473 billion [ph] and capital investments of about $511 million. Our investment focus in 2024 remains steadfast, with nearly all of our capital being deployed into assets which drive best-in-class outcomes for our customers, including more than 1,100 acres of land acquired and 370 transportation assets as well as enhanced physical infrastructure. With a new year upon us, I wanted to reiterate that our multi-decade investment horizon and longstanding approach to capital allocation is unwavering. We continue to prioritize investments that grow and diversify our existing marketplace businesses, including differentiated products and service capabilities. This includes our approach to yard infrastructure investments, which are critical to ensuring that we are positioned to serve our customers' needs for the long-term. We remain focused and disciplined on deploying capital through M&A and strategic partnerships, with valuation and/or strategic fit being the major hurdles that opportunistic transactions typically fail to clear. This consistent approach has positioned us to deliver outstanding business outcomes, while generating long-term value creation for our shareholders. And with that, Jeff and I would be happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bob Labick : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Bob. Bob Labick : Hi. So I wanted to start with the business financial model with all the moving parts and the various growth rates all growing of your different subcategories and stuff. So as you build out whole car, particularly a dealer and blue car, I want to maybe discuss the impact on the financial model. From our seat, we can see that there's less customer or seller concentration and maybe you get higher fees at some point on those, but there's also a lot more upfront investment, there's hiring and sales and infrastructure to get that ready. Is that the correct way to think about it? You're investing upfront now and then maybe over time the margins on those businesses will mature and grow? Or how should we think about that? And where are we in the process of investment for those growth initiatives? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think that's a fair question, Bob. I'd say long-term, the unit economics of those vehicles should be at parity or better than the traditional cars Copart has sold. The average selling prices tend to be higher as well. And so I think that's the long-term answer. Near-term, of course, there is some upfront investments to support the growth there, some more infrastructure-like spending to build the platform in the first place. So I think that question is fair, that observation is fair. Bob Labick : Okay, super. And then just, as it relates to Purple Wave, obviously nice growth for the year for them and you. Where are you in terms of kind of building out nationally? How should we think about that timeline for them? Jeff Liaw : I think they would describe themselves as still being in the transitional stage. They started as a more regional company focused in particular on the central time zone and are expanding their footprint from there. As you know, it is primarily a virtual business or historically was exclusively a virtual business. So they built an incredible pure auction platform in their arena and have built the Purple Wave brand to become a meaningful presence in that space. So they are expanding geographically as we speak. Bob Labick : Okay, great. And last one for me on Purple Wave too. If we are indeed moving into a lower interest rate environment like I think everyone believes, just given that [indiscernible] obviously new to you and to us, how does lower rates impact the [indiscernible] business model as we look out the next 1,3, 5 years? Jeff Liaw : Probably the candid answer is we don't know. This is just conjecture. But I think lower interest rates generally propagate more business activity period, right, the more purchase of new equipment, perhaps the trading in of old equipment. So I think lower interest rates will just lead to more -- just higher velocity activity period in the various spaces they serve. But as you know well, Bob, even to characterize their customers, their sellers, a single monolithic notion is not quite accurate. There's construction and agriculture and commercial construction versus residential. There's many, many nuances to all of the above. But in general, I think of low interest rates as being a catalyst for activity and activity, generally speaking, being a good thing for intermediaries like Purple Wave. Bob Labick : Super. All right. Thanks so much. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Healy : Thank you. Jeff and Leah, I just wanted to ask a little bit about the top of the business on the accident side. Kind of a variety of data points here today, just how miles driven is trending, how repairable claims are trending. You guys talked, I believe, to 6% volume growth on the insurance business. And I believe you said that total loss rates are up about 200 basis points. Just crude [ph] math, I mean, I would think that implies a level of accident frequency decline. And I was curious if you agree with that, if that is a new trend, do you think we're at the beginning of seeing a different rhythm to how accidents play out and impact the model? We'd just love to get your thoughts just on the frequency side specifically, I know people sometimes use repairable claims, but I think frequency is the area that I think a lot of investors would like to get more on. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Got it and a good question and a very nuanced one. What I would offer first is I think if you\u2019re simply doing the arithmetic of saying its 200 basis points of [indiscernible] starting point of 20%, that\u2019s 10% growth. I think for better or for worse those measures just aren't precise enough. You'll see the third parties that report them will even sometimes adjust those numbers in arrears. So they move around a fair bit and they don't match perfectly with the total loss volumes either if you just went back and did this exercise for 10 years. As to your observation about accident frequency perhaps declining, I think I would characterize that as having broadly been true for the past 50 years period. Accident frequency has always declined, certainly if you adjust for miles driven, a reflection of an ever safer car park, so you can imagine the big waves of innovation in the automotive space. In the mid-1970s, you saw anti-lock brakes arrive for the first time, which reduced crashes, in particular in winter time and with high precipitation conditions. Then the arrival of traction control and so forth in the years thereafter. Nowadays, autonomous braking, lane departure warning sensors are also reducing accident frequency. That's a longstanding trend. It has always been dwarfed on the other side by total loss frequency. So if accidents are down a little bit, total loss frequency is almost always outpaced that over any reasonable historical period. The one anomaly to that that I can remember, because I remember studying this a couple of years ago when we were talking about this topic then, was I want to say from memory 2013-'14, there was a 2, 3, 4-year period in which accident frequency per miles driven actually increased. And that, I think, was the adoption of smartphones and social media from while folks were driving, God forbid, but I think that was a catalyst then that has now been absorbed into the numbers. So I think we now see gradually declining accident frequency, but not a precipitous change, not a disruptive change of any kind, we would note. John Healy : Got it. Makes sense. And then I just wanted to hear more about the Express Titling product. You guys went into great detail on that. So, I would just try to make sure I understand kind of what the takeaway is there. My observation was that is something that insurance companies can alleviate internal functions, costs, headcount, you take that responsibility on. Are we interpreting it the right way? Is that this is Copart taking service levels to a higher degree, and it's something that allows you to drive the relationship further beyond just what the seller fee is and the turn time. Is that the right way to think about it? Jeff Liaw : I think you summarized it well. It's us forward integrating, so to speak, into functions historically led by the insurance industry. And they had kept it because the touch points with their own policyholders, their own customers was viewed as a critical matter, but they trust us enough to handle that for them. They know that with the scale of the millions of vehicles we sell and the millions of titles we're processing, that we [indiscernible] have the more efficient business processes and software and bespoke software for this very narrow business case than any of them could have individually. John Healy : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Craig Kennison : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. John had some really good ones there, and I wanted to follow-up on Title Express. Are you saying, Jeff, that will this actually save time in terms of the time it takes to cycle through a full sale and that it will save money for the insurance companies in the form of time? Jeff Liaw : Correct. Yes, time as well as fully burdened costs for their performing the function themselves. Imagine that Copart has a specialized department, and we do, led by a very capable, very longstanding leader here at Copart. And we do this, that group of folks does this full-time for a living and knows it cold. It's just easier to do that at the scale that we just talked about than it is for any individual insurance carrier, certainly the smaller ones, but also increasingly larger carriers as well than for them to staff. The people departments will leave this function on their own. If you ask any, if you ask the top 20 customers of Copart, what do you do best as an insurance company, you'll get answers ranging from underwriting to claims management to consumer advertising and marketing or what have you. Those are, and more frankly, investing the float too. Those are the core functions of an insurance company. I think you'd be pretty far down the list with any of them where they said title procurement is our bread and butter. That's where we distinguish ourselves. I think you hear that very rarely. Craig Kennison : So I'm curious. You've had that long enough to generate a million title transfers this year. To what extent is this a driver to your market share gains overall? Does this make the front page of your pitch book? Jeff Liaw : It is certainly in the pitch book. It is perceived as. And so it had been, again, there are good reasons for insurance companies to want to keep this function in-house. I think the catalyst for change in recent years started with COVID-19 in part when insurance companies realized that hiring and retaining folks and managing them remotely and deploying laptops and remote call centers, et cetera, was increasingly complex, increasingly problematic, and not worth the squeeze. So they trusted us, they trialed the project with us, and I think we've delivered over and over again. I think it's a reflection of their trust in us in that regard. Craig Kennison : Great. Thanks. And, Leah, if I could ask you, you mentioned the $12 million out of period expense. Can you shed more light on that expense? In which period did it normally occur? Leah Stearns : Sure. In total for yard Ops, we had $16 million in the fourth quarter of nonrecurring expense. Twelve of that was related to our U.S. segment. A little over $4 million was related to our international segment. And so I would consider it to be really non-recurring. A portion of it was related in the U.S. to property taxes that are related to prior periods and also grossing up our accruals to levels we expect for here to go forward. And then some of the other related items are related to out-of-period invoicing for some of our vendors that we received in the fourth quarter. Craig Kennison : Okay, thanks. And just one on Purple Wave. I'm curious, how many territory managers did you add, if that's the right metric? I'm trying to get a feel for whether that 17% is driven by, external matters or really driven by your expansion plan. I'd say both our drivers is both expansion of territory but also like territory growth, in territory growth, so to speak. And remember, this is a virtual business. Of course, they do have the team and the sales force, so to speak, to reach out to potential sellers of the business and customer support agents and the like. But it's virtual, so it's not quite like opening a new Starbucks on the street corner. It's more adding the institutional sales force to go to pursue the clients in the first place. Craig Kennison : Got it. Hey, thank you. Leah Stearns : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with BNP power bus. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. Chris Bottiglieri. I'll fix that one. Question for you. I'm going to cut the volume question a little bit differently. There's been press reports that would suggest that auto and home insurance rates see a skyrocket. Consumers are canceling auto insurance, reducing coverage. I'm just curious if you're hearing this from insurers, how does a lower insurance rate impact your business? In past cycles, obviously [indiscernible] now at climate change and [indiscernible] normalizes that as I went past cycles, we\u2019ve seen people cut [indiscernible] auto insurance and drop the penetration and [indiscernible]. Jeff Liaw : Got it. Fair question. And I think if history is any guide, I would say it is modestly negative in the sense that if folks either are uninsured altogether, or perhaps they have liability-only coverage to save money, and they have the abandoned collision and comprehensive, then there may be claims that previously their insurance carrier would have handled and therefore would have totaled the car through Copart that may lead them on the margin to trying to fix it, trying to patch it together or trying to drive a car that otherwise would have been total. I think if the financial crisis in '09, this is from memory or from research, frankly, but the downturn in '09 and since has shown very modest effect of this, almost an immeasurable one, but I think directionally speaking, that's what would happen. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes, [indiscernible]. And then I think we gave a ton of metrics here, so I might have botched these, but it sounded like U.S is up six, U.S insurance is up six, but then dealer fleet [indiscernible] fleet rental finance of 20 and dealer plus 10. So it seems like there's an offset somewhere. Is that just low value charity cars? And is there a competitor that's being irrational there that's causing a drag in that segment or is it something more systemic? Leah Stearns : No, it's just that low value bucket continues to shrink. Chris Bottiglieri : And what's causing that to shrink? Is that competition or is it just something like a market that's changing? Leah Stearns : It's really just our focus in terms of where we're allocating our efforts. Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think it's a combination of the [indiscernible]. It's competitive tension as well as institutional prioritization, right? That we will always have scarce resources and that is, those are the units that we are most willing to work on. Chris Bottiglieri : Makes sense. Okay. Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bret Jordan : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Jeff Liaw : Bret. Bret Jordan : On the 6% insurance units, I think you guys were still taking share in the fourth quarter from a peer in the space. Could you sort of carve out what was organic growth versus share gain year-over-year in that quarter? Jeff Liaw : Bret, we don't have that off the top of our head, but you're right. It is both organic growth as well as share capture. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess sort of similar question, on a year-over-year cap basis, obviously you spent money prepping for storms that didn't result in a lot of cars. Do you have a year-over-year number on how many cars came from catastrophic events in the fourth quarter versus the prior year? Jeff Liaw : Very modest. So in the grand scheme of Copart's, relatively speaking, a rounding error. That said, the mobilizations weren't trivial. So this year with multiple storms, multiple named storms, we do mobilize trucks and people and such in anticipation of those storms. We don't have the luxury of waiting to see if it's real. We mobilize in advance because that's what we owe our customers. So we did have multiple mobilizations this year with trivial volume to show for it. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess, final question, on the yard operation expense growth, is part of that the investment you've been making in recent years in expanding the real estate portfolio? Do you have to staff yards that aren't at full capacity yet or that are deleveraging around some of this capital investment or is it really just sort of a spike in labor and some of these non-recurring costs? Is there something more structural as you've expanded so much acreage recently that builds in a higher yard operating expense? Jeff Liaw : One very narrow example, Bret, is the increased footprint that also has brought higher property tax bills, both literally with more acreage as well as rising property values around the country. So that's definitely in the P&L as well. As for the deleveraging, I think that largely is smoothed out over time. We don't have a huge bolus of yards opening at one moment in time. So as those -- as we encounter those facilities that have new management, new staff for which we don\u2019t yet have a volume to fully absorb that we also have volume coming into yards that are more mature, more fully matured for which we are getting the operating leverage. So that [indiscernible] distortion, it's a small. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Bret Jordan : Thanks, Bret. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jash Patwa with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jash Patwa : Hi, good evening and thanks for taking my question. Just one on the non-insurance business, if you could give us an update on the business mix in terms of the proportion of revenue and any color around the demographics of the non-insurance customers. I believe you have been investing towards building out a dedicated buyer base on the whole car side for a few quarters now. It would be great if you could share some early inning results on this front. Thanks, and I will follow up. Jeff Liaw : Great. So as for those non-insurance sellers, the key dimensions would be our blue car volume. We think of that as institutional sellers like banks and rental car companies, corporate fleets, and dealers. So that's Copart dealer services at number two. Number three, cash for cars. So this is our consumer-facing business at Copart through which we buy cars from consumers. For example, those liability coverage-only consumers who end up with a wrecked car are looking for ways to dispose of them. All three are meaningful. We don't think we've disclosed precisely how much is each, but all three are substantial in the scheme of our non-insurance business. The one correction or one clarification I'd make to your inquiry about the buyer base is that we definitely don't think of it as a dedicated buyer base. We think of the buyer base as being very much an integrated one, and the importance of the crossover buyer underscores that point. So we often will have buyers arrive for the first time to look at a rental car that's six years old, a perfectly drivable vehicle, who then discovers that insurance cars nearby or perhaps not nearby fit the bill as well because they were hail cars or they're otherwise drivable or they have damage that doesn't affect at all the fundamentals of the vehicle as is. So those buyers end up buying cars from both sides. We find that to be the case far more than we find the case of the dedicated buyers you described. I would say the shared characteristic across all of these sellers is that the international buyers for Copart are very relevant. The international buyers, as you know probably from having followed us for a while, generally buy cars that are more valuable, in fact, much more valuable than the average car sold at Copart. And that is true, too, of the non-insurance vehicles. They are active participants both as buyers and as bidders, which of course drives liquidity and drives selling prices for Copart as well. Jash Patwa : Understood. That is very helpful color. Just one more for me on the fee side. I think it has been a couple of years since you have implemented any major fee hikes on the buy side. Curious if you could share any color around the historical framework for fee increases with pricing, moderating on the salvage car side as well as on the whole car side. And wondering if any changes in the competitive environment have altered your approach to fee hikes in recent years? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I'll acknowledge that's a good and reasonable substantive question. It's one we don't address on -- in forums like this one. We view ourselves as responsible long-term stewards of this business. We focus first and foremost on delivering value to our sellers, to our buyers and we trust that in the long run we'll also capture our appropriate share thereof. So we don't talk about fee schedules, I would encourage you to pursue that research through third parties. Jash Patwa : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to pass the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Thank you for joining us. We'll talk to you in a couple of months. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Copart Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before turning the call over to management, I will share Copart's Safe Harbor statement. The company's comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in the company's markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For more detail on the risks associated with the company's business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024, and each of the company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company has no obligation to update, or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn the call over to the company's CEO, Jeff Liaw. Jeff Liaw : Thank you everyone for joining the earnings call for our first quarter for fiscal 2025. On our recent calls, we've been talking about some important themes about our business, including our recent growth with bank rental and fleet sellers. We talked about Title Express, a new offering we're offering the insurance industry. We've talked about sustainability, and we talked about growth in our international businesses, as well as in the heavy equipment space as well. Today, with the first quarter past us for this next fiscal year, we thought it would be a good opportunity to reflect specifically about our insurance business specifically. There are two themes I wanted to draw upon today. First is our response to the recent hurricane activity in the Southeastern United States, and the second is the longer term trends that we observe in the insurance industry more broadly. First, regarding the recent flurry of hurricane activity. In late September of this year, Category 4 Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida. Severe flooding of course struck the Tampa St. Petersburg area, and eventually caused significant damage elsewhere in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina, including areas not accustomed to dealing with storms of this magnitude. Then, less than two weeks later, Category 3 Hurricane Milton struck Florida again, the back-to-back nature of the storms added a level of complexity, to our storm response that we hadn't previously experienced, including a brief evacuation of our own people in certain most dangerous areas. In comparison to Hurricane Ian, a similarly scaled and located storm from just two years ago, our advanced preparation and our team's execution this time around yielded still better results, with approximately twice as many vehicles picked up in the first 10 days of these 2024 storms in comparison to Ian in 2022. As always, our emphasis is on retrieving, processing and selling vehicles as quickly as we can, to help restore the communities in, which we do business back to their prior state and to assist our clients, the major insurance companies, in resolving their claims with policyholders as quickly as they can. To that end, by the end of October, just three weeks after landfall for Milton, we had sold approximately a quarter of all of the assigned vehicles we would ultimately receive from both Helene and Milton. In fact, according to one third-party source, three out of every four catastrophic units sold in Florida during the month of October were sold on Copart's auction platform, a reflection both of our presence as well as the speed of our execution. This go around, our proactive storm preparation was marked by three pillars. First, the dedicated owned storage capacity that we hold in reserve for storms of this nature, representing nearly 2,000 acres nationwide, and approximately 1,000 acres specifically for the Helene and Milton areas alone. Second, our technology and logistics teams have deployed real-time tools that, serve both our own people as well as our third-party towing network as well as our own employed drivers in optimizing routing and optimizing dispatch for the rapid retrieval and movement of vehicles through our network. And finally, our industry leading, contracted and full time towing and transport network which we have steadily built up over the years, was able to respond with unprecedented speed, in this instance. I've already had an opportunity to do so face-to-face with many of the Copart employees. But we again wanted to extend our heartfelt gratitude, to the more than 1,200 folks and their families who sacrificed for days, in some cases weeks and months at a time, to work in challenging conditions, to work long hours to assist again our clients, our people and our communities. Turning our attention to our insurance business more broadly, our insurance business grew approximately 13% for the quarter in unit volume, when excluding the effect of catastrophic events, we grew 9% year-over-year for the quarter. Total loss frequency was certainly one of the major catalysts we experienced, with the total loss frequency for the calendar quarter ending September 30, reported by CCC of 21.7%, an increase of almost 2% year-over-year. More broadly though, we wanted to pause for a moment to reflect on longer term industry trends. There, as you know, has been a steady drumbeat in the news media and in various company announcements, on accident avoidance technologies and autonomous driving rollouts over the past decade plus. And in addition, we've encountered a number of inquiries in recent days, from investors and other interested parties, on this subject as well. Our answer here will be especially U.S. centric, but the takeaways, I think are broadly applicable to the markets in, which we do business. We all of course, draw inferences from our own empirical experience. The cars we drive, we now experience more of the safety technologies in the form of, lane departure warning systems that buzz our steering wheels, rear cameras that we probably all use when we back up our cars nowadays. And many of us have also taken rides in autonomous taxis, within the geofence areas in which they're operating today. We think there's also insight to be derived, however, from multiple decade trends that we can absorb - that we can observe in actual data. There are four factors I wanted to draw out today, and then a secondary consideration I wanted to offer that inform our perspective, on the long-term organic growth trends in our business. The first is simply population growth. Since 1960, population in the United States has grown at 1% compounded, which sounds like a fairly modest growth rate. But over a time horizon of that scale, our population has almost doubled in the United States. The second consideration is vehicle miles traveled, which over that same horizon, plus or minus, has grown at 2%. As a result, vehicle miles traveled over that horizon has quadrupled from 1960 to today, which is to say that ultimately vehicle miles traveled, as a country grows more populous and more prosperous, as the United States has done, generally outpaces population growth alone. We're all aware of course, of the anomalous, very well documented steep decline in vehicle miles traveled in 2020. Courtesy of COVID-19, we are now above pre-pandemic peaks on this specific metric. If you were to look at a visual chart, showing vehicle miles traveled over this 60 plus year period, I think you'd likely also conclude that we still have several years of return to work tailwinds ahead of us, as more and more businesses implement those policies. The third phenomenon, I want to comment on specifically is accident rates and their long-term trends downwards. So over the past 30 years, the Department of Transportation has published data on police reported crashes. There is one anomalous trend from the 2014 to 2018 period, I think marked likely by the proliferation of smartphones, and the addictive apps that certainly afflict us all that caused accident rates, actually to increase in certain years during that period. But nonetheless, over the decades long horizon, we've seen a steady decline in accidents per miles driven. And in fact today versus 1990, there are approximately one-third fewer crashes and fatalities per million miles driven. But in absolute terms that decline has only been 8%. Because of the offsetting effects of the growth in population and vehicle miles travel. Safety technologies penetrate gradually into new vehicle shipments and still more gradually into the installed base of drivable vehicles. And it is that fleet effect, which causes the gradual decline in accidents relative to the perhaps more innovative technology deployments exhibited or implemented by OEMs today. And then the fourth, and most important driver of our business is total loss frequency itself. It has been the key catalyst in our growth now for decades, and it's grown more than fourfold since 1990. This again is a phenomenon that has exhibited a nearly monotonic increase over that period. But for an anomaly in late 2021 and early 2022, when the pop in used car prices made total loss a relatively expensive settlement procedure for insurance companies, briefly suppressing total loss frequency. We are yet again above pre-pandemic highs on this specific metric. The long-term catalyst here is that vehicles become ever more complex, including for reasons that the safety technologies we've already talked about today, and therefore more expensive to repair, rendering the repair path less attractive. While also the intrinsic value of these vehicles rise via our marketplace. We find still more buyers in places like Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Africa and elsewhere, where their mobility needs are ultimately satisfied by our wrecked cars. The proliferation of safety technologies that drive accident frequency down, and by the way, there have been multiple rounds of these technologies over the decades, from antilock brakes in the 70s and 80s, to the more sensor driven technologies of today. But the proliferation of these technologies is not incidental to total loss frequency, but in fact directly causal. These technologies tend to be enabled by sensors and chips, often configured on the perimeter of vehicles, rendering them quickly and easily damaged in an accident, and raising the cost of repair as a result. Those cars in turn are still quite valuable, to our destination markets as drivable contributors to the mobility in those markets. One additional secondary driver I thought was worth mentioning today, is the phenomenon of uninsured, underinsured and under-capitalized motorists specifically. On the point of uninsured or liability only drivers, there is a very clear 30-year plus trend downward, meaning over time, in a market like the United States, insurance coverage generally becomes more robust. We do however, observe cyclicality within that longer term secular trend, driven in part by insurance premiums, the economic health of the country and so forth. In the past year or two in particular, insurance premiums have generally increased at a pace - at a rate outpacing other components of the consumer experience in part, because of the natural regulatory lag in raising insurance rates. As a result then, the liability only plus uninsured motorists combined are a greater share of the drivable fleet than they had been in prior years. Again, the long-term trend here appears to be a secular trend downwards in any case. The upshot of all of the above for us, is that as we look forward on a five, 10 and 20 year horizon, our baseline expectation continues to be of ongoing organic industry growth. As population and vehicle miles traveled trends plus total loss frequency most importantly of all, more than offset declining accident frequency, as safety technologies penetrates new vehicle shipments and eventually the drivable fleet. We do expect perhaps more volatility from contributors such as used car prices, from severe weather events and the like on both fronts. Then we're investing accordingly, to ensure that we have the physical technology and people capacity to serve our insurance clients under any conditions. With that, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Leah Stearns. Leah Stearns : Thank you, Jeff. I'll begin with our first quarter sales trends. During the quarter, our global unit sales and inventory increased 12% and 6% respectively from the year ago period and was a function of growth in total loss frequency and share gains. Focusing on our U.S. business, unit growth was about 11%, which reflects fee unit growth of 11% and purchase unit growth of nearly 6%. Consignment or fee units, continue to constitute the vast majority of our U.S. unit volume. Our U.S. insurance unit volume increased about 12% year-over-year and approximately 9% excluding cat units. We continue to grow our volume with non-insurance sellers, by leveraging our core capabilities in outdoor storage via our real estate portfolio, a strong network of logistics solutions and a global liquid buyer base. We are also seeking to optimize the mix of non-insurance units from a profitability perspective, as we continue to prune the low value unit volume. During the quarter. Our blue car business, which serves our bank and finance fleet and rental segment partners, continued its strong trend of year-over-year growth of over 20%. Our dealer sales volume, a combination of our Copart dealer services division and National Powersports Auctions, increased sales volumes by over 2% year-over-year with CDS declining less than 1% and NPA increasing nearly 14%, and low value units including charities and municipalities declining 4%. On a final note, our partner in the specialty equipment space Purple Wave, has driven double-digit gross transaction value growth year-over-year for the trailing 12-month period ending October 31, which significantly outpaces industry growth in the equipment auction marketplaces they serve. This impressive growth demonstrates, the value of our partnership and what it brings to the market. Overall, inventory levels in the U.S. increased over 5%, and decreased by about 1% when excluding low value and cat units. Turning to our international business, we saw unit growth of nearly 16% in the quarter, including about 6% from cat units, due to severe floods in the UAE and Brazil, with fee units increasing about 16% in Q1, and purchased units increasing by just over 14% for the quarter. Our international business ended the quarter, with inventory levels over 10% ahead of prior year. Global ASPs declined by less than 1% for the quarter, relative to the year ago period. Our U.S. ASPs continue to show resilience, and are significantly outperforming the used vehicle market more broadly. While the Mannheim Used Vehicle Price Index, declined by about 4% year-over-year, our U.S. insurance ASPs declined by only 1% over the same time period and had a slight increase of about 1% sequentially, internationally ASPs increased nearly 7%. Turning to our financial performance, global revenue in the quarter increased to $1.15 billion, representing growth of over $126 million, or about 12%. Global service revenue increased nearly $127 million, or about 15% for the first quarter, primarily due to increased volume. U.S. service revenue grew by about 13% for the quarter, which included 2% attributable to cat units, and international service revenue grew by about 30%. Global purchased vehicle sales for the first quarter decreased less than $1 million, or approximately 20 basis points, while global purchased vehicle gross profit increased by about 72% in the first quarter. In the U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up about $9 million, or about 12%, while purchased vehicle gross profit increased nearly $5 million, or about 77% for the quarter. Internationally, purchased vehicle revenue decreased by nearly $10 million, or nearly 12%, and gross profit increased by $4 million, or about 67% in the first quarter. The reduction in international purchased vehicle revenue, accompanied by an increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher ASP insurance vehicles in Germany, which transitioned from purchase contract to a consignment model coupled with stronger purchase unit margins in the U.K. Global facility related costs, which includes facility operations, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, increased $88 million or about 22%. In the U.S., facility related costs increased $74 million or nearly 22%. During the quarter, we recognized $29 million in incremental costs associated with Hurricanes Helene and Milton. This reflects non-capitalized costs associated with units sold in the quarter, which is a change from our past cat financial disclosures. There remain $18 million in costs, which were included - oh sorry, which were incurred and are currently capitalized on the balance sheet. These will be recognized as the remaining cat units are sold. Excluding the costs associated with the hurricanes, facility related costs per unit, increased about 4% from the prior year period. This normalized increase in per unit cost reflects our ongoing investments in expanded operational capacity to support our continued growth. International facility related costs were up $14 million, an increase of nearly 24% or approximately 7% on a per unit basis. The increase in per unit costs, was primarily due to growth in headcount to support our business in the U.K. During the quarter, global gross profit was approximately $512 million representing an increase of $48 million or about 10% and our gross margin percent decreased by approximately 82 basis points to 44.7% in the quarter. In the U.S. our gross profit increased to $448 million, which was over 28, an increase of over $28 million or about 7%, and gross margin decreased 260 basis points to 47.2%. Our international gross profit increased to $65 million, about $20 million of an increase, or 44% and gross margin increased over 740 basis points to 32.3% in the quarter. Turning to our general and administrative expenditures, which were $106 million in the quarter, this increase of $37 million reflects growth across the investments we have made into growing our specialty equipment sales team, which covers both a geographic and sector specific coverage perspective. We expect to generate meaningful growth in specialty equipment gross transaction value over the next 12 to 24 months, as a direct result of this investment. In addition, the investments we're making in our platform services teams and systems, which include our legal compliance, technology and our finance and people and culture teams, have continued with support from third-parties. We would expect these expenses, to partially recede over the next 12 months and believe the business will be well positioned, to generate strong operating leverage in the future. As a result, first quarter GAAP operating income, increased by about 3% to over $406 million, which includes a modest headwind from the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. And finally, first quarter GAAP net income increased by about 9% to over $362 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share. During the quarter, we did benefit from over $13 million of incremental interest income, as we have actively invested our cash into treasury securities, and for the quarter our tax rate was 20%. Turning to our capital structure, as of the end of October we had over $4.9 billion of liquidity, which is comprised of nearly $3.7 billion in cash and our capacity under a revolving credit facility. For the quarter, we generated free cash flow of about $246 million, reflecting operating cash flow generation of $482 million and capital investments of about $237 million. Our strong performance in responding to the hurricanes during the quarter, was directly attributable to the investments we've made in our teams, cat land portfolio, logistics solutions and technology platforms. We expect to prioritize the deployment of capital into these areas, as we strive to continuously improve upon our service levels on behalf of our customers. And with that, Jeff and I would be happy to take some questions. Operator : Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Bob Labick from CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Bob Labick : Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking our questions. Jeff Liaw : Hi, Bob. Bob Labick : Hi. I wanted to follow-up on your earlier discussion on total loss frequency and salvage trends and whatnot. I think you said 21.7% is roughly where total loss frequency is, so it's obviously really returned and gotten high. You've mentioned on prior calls that this is obviously a combination of some of your customers, insurance companies, well above that and then therefore some are below that as well. So I was wondering if you could tell us some of the characteristics of the insurance companies that are at the higher end of that or at the lower end. Are they, you know, the big ones are higher and small ones are lower. Is it tech savvy versus old school? How should we think about that? And then maybe more importantly, what are the reasons a company would keep, have a lower total loss frequency, is that intentional or maybe just. I'll stop there? Jeff Liaw : Got it. Bob, a very fair question and for one, one for which there isn't a tidy one paragraph answer, the reality is if you even took one insurance carrier and compared them regionally against themselves, I think you'd find meaningful variation even within a given company. Broadly speaking, I think you highlighted a couple of axes on, which our insurance clients can vary, including their book of business. Where there are certain types of cars, certainly high end luxury automobiles, for which some policyholders are less open minded about retaining a heavily damaged and now heavily repaired vehicle after the fact. So for customer service accommodation reasons, sometimes those cars are totaled more readily than they otherwise would be. In terms of total loss practices, I think that some of the variations we'll see are literally the decision making criteria. So at one end of the spectrum you'll have folks who if anything, still have the statutory mindset, for lack of a better expression, which is to say that in certain states, if damage exceeds X percent of the intact value of the car, by statute, a carrier must offer the policyholder a total loss, at least as an option. And so, some carriers to this day still adopt that a 75% threshold or whatever arbitrary threshold for the repair estimate divided by the intact value of the car, to determine the absolute line above which all cars are totaled and below, which none of the cars are totaled. Others are adopting a more like a more individual underwriting, so to speak on an individual claim. So a claim comes in, what is the repair cost for this claim? How long will it take? What will the rental charges be on this repair, while it's in the shop? How much can we generate for that car at Copart instead? And then make an individual economic decision? Every carrier is somewhere on that spectrum. But as you noted, there's a huge dispersion among insurance carriers today and we certainly provide them with a number of tools, to help them make that decision better and help them make that decision faster. I think we've made strides in that regard, but certainly with many years of progress still to come. Bob Labick : Okay. Great. And then just one other question for me. Obviously continued nice success with the blue car initiative there with the reduction, the kind of near term current reduction in off lease vehicles, which I know you don't participate in really, but how does it impact the supply, if at all of from your blue car customers, because there's less younger cars kind of going into the reconditioning market. Is this impacting the total loss frequency on the blue car area, versus just the regular salvage cars or have you seen any impact thus far? Are you expecting any over the next couple quarters? Leah Stearns : I'll take that one Bob. Just in terms of how we see off lease volumes impact our non-insurance business, it's more impactful to our CDS business, more of our dealer services. It's just the overall volume impact to the wholesale market, and how that can influence pricing and unit availability. It's less impactful from a blue car perspective, because again remember many of those blue car units still have some level of damage. And increasingly, we're working towards being close to having lower damaged vehicles flowing through blue car. But the off lease units are more impacting the overall unit volume, within the wholesale market as a whole, and that can impact pricing and availability for the broader dealer wholesale space. Jeff Liaw : Bob, I'd say for our business off lease volume is not per se, a specific catalyst, it's just one contributor to the supply and demand dynamics, for new and used vehicles overall. So it perhaps is somewhat softening used vehicle supply, but that's one variable amidst a large range of them that influence those used car prices. Bob Labick : Okay. Super, thank you very much. I'll jump back in queue. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Jeff two for you. The first one I want to ask about is following up the question from last core ask on insurance, uninsured motorists. I was wondering what he's historically seen when there's been changes like from cat events. We have large hurricanes. On one hand, you think the higher insurance costs afterwards could be problematic for insurance participation. On the other hand, it might be a stark reminder that you need comprehensive insurance, because your losses go up when there's major cats. So just curious if you saw an impact in the past? Jeff Liaw : Chris, I'd say the data we've seen, and I was going to give you the citation here as well, it's from I think the Insurance Institute, I believe, and they tracked uninsured motorists back to call it the late 1980s plus or minus with an annual figure. That annual figure would be for the country overall. There are other sources from, which we derive liability coverage also. And I'd say given the nationwide nature of the data, trying to find that finely parsed question as to whether Hurricane Sandy led to changes in the Northeast or Ian and Hilton [ph] and Milton and Helene caused changes in Florida, Harvey and Texas that I don't think we can quite see in the data, right. So when I look at 2017, for example, Hurricane Harvey, major event, there's not per se an attributable change to the uninsured motorist population then. Chris Bottiglieri : Yes. Okay, that makes sense. It's tough. All right similar question that's probably equally hard to answer and ask anyway, if you go back to the Trump tariff, I know you don't have any direct impact, but I was just curious your ASP surge then obviously a lot of factors of Harvey and I think just changes in security vehicles. But just curious, like was there any noticeable impact on your business from the Trump tariff regime in '18, '19? Did you see impacts on ASP or total loss rates or anything else, would it be obvious someone in my suit? Jeff Liaw : Not one we could isolate, no. And I think even the natural, the nature of your question is probably looking forward, what it means for our business. And I think there are certainly, certainly elements of this that are unknown. I would say that most of the countries, I think, with which the administration has those tariffs in mind, China, for example, are not per se meaningful importers of cars to the United States, nor are they particularly meaningful export markets for Copart either. So could we. We could face some contradictory effects here in our own business. You can imagine scenarios in, which the value of the cars we sell are certainly higher, because they're already landed on U.S. shores, and so they're now competing against vehicles, or parts from overseas that may now face new tariffs. You could also imagine a scenario in, which it causes used car values to be higher than they otherwise would be. Which could bring back some of the phenomenon we saw in late 2021 and 2022 in which demand for our services otherwise is suppressed relative to where it otherwise would be, right. Because if ACVs are sky high, our unit economics are better. But total loss frequency can also be softer as a result. How that all plays out over the course of the next 12 months, the next four years, I don't think we know precisely, but I would say the last time around there was not a meaningful disruption to the business. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning. Good evening. I guess question on the G&A, Leah, I think you said a lot of that $36 million was specialty sales team growth that might recede over the next 12 months. In the shorter term, do you expect to continue to build that up as you're focusing outside, into the incremental markets outside of salvage, or are we sort of added G&A spend level that you see flatlining? Leah Stearns : We'll be disciplined in terms of when we make those investments. Specifically, attributable to your point around the specialty sales team expansion, we're being opportunistic. And so, to the extent that we find the right sales team members will bring them on board, we have targeted areas that we're focusing on initially. But if there are opportunistic hires that we can make, that makes sense for us, we certainly will pursue that. That G&A investment that we've made, we've basically doubled the headcount in our sales team since the acquisition. And so, it's a fairly sizable increase. And we're likely to digest that for a period of time. But I don't want to take anything off the table, and assume that we won't be pursuing hires to the extent that we find the right folks. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then Jeff, you mentioned that three of four cars, of cat cars in Florida were going via Copart. I guess. How does that compare to your market share in Florida? Is it an example that you are just cross collecting and processing cars faster and they're languishing on competitors lots, you know, sort of. How does that three of four cars\u2026? Jeff Liaw : Yes, I think that'd be. It's probably speculation. I'm not prepared to undertake at the moment. But I think it reflects, yes, our market presence there and it does reflect speed. So I think our ability to process cars the time both retrieved, and have the salvage titles issued. To be fair, Florida is one of the more efficient states among the 50s in terms of how quickly they issue salvage titles back to us. So it's a function of all of those things. But I think they're - we do perceive a competitive advantage in terms of how quickly we respond to catastrophic events. Bret Jordan : Is Title Express playing a role in that salvage title, or is it just the state is more cooperative than others? Jeff Liaw : It can. So as you - as I think we talked about last time, we're now managing the titles for approximately 1 million vehicles per year. So now it's a sizable portion of every - of all the titles due process on behalf of insurance carriers. The salvage title issuance is the speed with, which the state responds to us once we submit the original title. Our Title Express team determines - can help determine how quickly we retrieved that original title. So their ability to do so, yes, yields a competitive advantage. Their ability to do so quickly yields an advantage in Florida and elsewhere. Bret Jordan : Thank you. Jeff Liaw : Thanks Bret. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question here is from Alice Wycklendt from Baird. Please go ahead. Alice Wycklendt : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I think maybe the off lease discussion kind of touched on this a little bit, but wanted to just hit on the dealer services side again. I think you said it was down just under 1%. Can you confirm that? I have that number, right. And then if that's the case, maybe a little bit more detail about what you're seeing in that market, as it seems like a slowdown from the kind of prior four quarter trend? Leah Stearns : So Alice, I think what we saw in the first quarter was just a pause in September, some slightly lower volumes related to some specific accounts. But we saw October come back. So I don't think it's a headwind that will persist. But we are obviously watching that closely. I think generally speaking the wholesale space was a bit soft in September, so it was correlated with what we saw in the broader market. Alice Wycklendt : Great. That's it from me. Thanks. Jeff Liaw : Thanks, Alice. Operator : Next question is from Jash Patwa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jash Patwa : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the shift towards consignment models or model units in Germany. Curious if you could elaborate on what you are seeing in the market there, and whether we are arriving at a turning point with a broader shift towards consignment based units from the insurance carriers there? Thanks, another follow-up. Jeff Liaw : Jash, appreciate the question. I think as you probably know, if you followed Copart for a while, it's often the case that when we enter new markets, and enter new quote seller segments. For example in the U.K., when we first launched our business we were largely a principal shop, so we'd buy cars from insurance carriers. As we proved to the marketplace that we had a liquid auction platform. And that in fact the sellers could achieve better results by letting it ride, so to speak, by selling the cars at Copart auctions. We invariably migrated them over time to an auction like, to a pure auction arrangement. And that is now true in the U.K. In the U.S., the example would be there are certain cars, we once would have bought from certain institutional sellers like charities and so forth that, over time again eventually migrate to an auction format instead. In Germany the journey has been much the same as you might imagine. All of these progressions are gradual, so it's not an overnight snapping of the fingers. But that's certainly the direction in, which we want to move the business, the direction in which the business should move as well, right. It's the right economic outcome for us to all, for us and our clients to be on the same side of the table rooting for the same outcomes. And that's ultimately why we want to achieve that destination. So we have made progress. There's still room to go in that respect. Jash Patwa : Understood. That's very helpful. I also noticed an uptick in CapEx spend, relative to the run rate over the past couple years. Could you share any details around the nature of these investments, and if we should expect a similar run rate going forward? Just any granularity around the cost pockets, whether it's primarily land oriented, or any other investments that you're making? Thanks. Jeff Liaw : I think it's fair to say in this period and in virtually any historical period, capital expenditures for Copart will largely be land and development and in technology, really those two or those three dimensions. And they're a reflection of immediate need and a reflection of growth expectations as well. I wouldn't read a whole lot into quarter-to-quarter variations. You might imagine there are facilities that we have diligence and have been pursuing, have been negotiating for months, in some cases years, and believe it or not, in some cases decades, that finally come to fruition and we don't schedule them, right so to speak. We buy the land when we can, either land we've already leased, or land we can immediately use, or raw land we then subsequently have to develop, before we can use it ourselves. All of those things are folded into that one number in capital expenditures. So it's hard to read a whole lot into it. But we are delighted to invest in land, in capacity and in technology. We think it equips us to serve our insurance clients, as I noted at the beginning of the call, to support their growth. The industry's growth over time, and to support industry volatility over time. I think requires us to invest more capital, thoughtfully of course, always diligently, of course. But we're delighted to do it, because we think it's necessary to serve our clients. Jash Patwa : Thanks for all the color. Good luck. Jeff Liaw : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to CEO, Jeff Liaw for any closing comments. Jeff Liaw : Yes, thanks for joining us. We'll talk to you next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",
