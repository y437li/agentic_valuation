Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Elizabeth Farrell : Thank you Keith. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, the President and CEO of our Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of our North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Beth. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This morning we have very positive results to report, although many are probably already more interested in next quarter as a consequence of Hurricane Matthew, we will get to that but first a bit about the third quarter. As you have seen the operating earnings per share were $6.53 which translates to a 14% annualized operating ROE, this of course leads expectations impart due to another light cat core, however that is only part of the story. Overall, the attritional combined ratio has improved year-over-year and I believe represents the more relevant part of the message. In both the reinsurance and insurance segments, there is positive movement. Reinsurance for example on a year-to-date basis has improved the attritional combined ration from 82.7 to 80.7, this is partially due to a lower frequency large risk losses, but also a result of continuing to modify our portfolio in the phase of a declining rate environment to achieve the best risk adjusted return. In addition and perhaps more impactful are the newer lines of business we are taking on, which in general include mortgage and credit exposure as well as structured products, John Doucette will give some detail on these individual reports. On the insurance side, the story is also favorable after excluding Heartland, as you know was our crop operation that was sold during the quarter. Excluding crop, the North American insurance operation reported a year-to-date attrition combined ratio of 96.4%. This is higher than our longer term objective partly due to an increased expense ratio, as we are currently ramping up and investing heavily in this segment, both domestically and internationally. This is consistent with the strategy we have discussed in the past. Build versus buy strategy has been our best option as we have been able to capitalized on the Everest brand, and the talent availability coming from recent M&A transactions as well as corporate restructurings. Also elevating the insurance attritional combined ratio this year was an abnormally high level of weather event. Taking all this into account, we are extremely pleased with our portfolio on how the operational build is progressing. Jonathan Zaffino will later give you further detail on the insurance operations. To sum up our reinsurance and insurance operations generated underwriting income excluding cat losses through the nine-months of $583 million, which on average is almost $200 million per quarter. When combined with average quarterly investment income operating earnings are in the range of approximately $315 million per quarter before cat losses. At our effective tax rate that equates to approximately $275 million. This number is relevant as you begin to think about the impact of Hurricane Matthew on fourth quarter results. Currently our modeled estimate, for an industry loss that ranges between $3 billion and $9 billion are $75 million to $200 million net of taxes in reinstatement premiums. At this early stage, this is our best estimate and would appear to be containing within our otherwise normal quarterly operating earnings. Turning to other items of note, first is that investment income was above the prior year's quarter and on a year-to-date basis essentially flat. Given the current investment environment and the current reinvestment rates are lower than the maturing assets this is an outstanding result. Not unlike underwriting portfolio, we take similar action on the investment front. Rotation into good risk adjusted bets has been the strategy, which has maintained yield but with one of the lowest data in the industry. Second was the aforementioned sale of our crop operation in the third quarter. And clearly we are not at the scale we needed to be in order to be sufficiently profitable. The outcome was essentially a transaction, which converted our insurance book into a reinsurance program, taking the advantage of the expense synergy that our client can bring to bear in larger portfolio. Finally, I would like to highlight the $200 million of share re-purchases that we have made since last quarter. This brings the year-to-date number to $386 million. We continue to manage capital with an approached that considers our long-term business opportunities. This essentially means that while we do buy in capital our bias is that we will continue to find ways to put capital to work profitably and grow the franchise. Our history would suggest that we have managed this effectively. And therefore as always we elect not to give guidance on this point to maintain our flexibility. While current market conditions in our point of any rapid growth there remain numerous opportunities to put capital to work. In particular we see a continued pace in insurance segment as well as specialty areas in the reinsurance sector. Therefore, for now, we will maintain our current capital management strategy of share repurchases and dividend at a level less than our projected earnings. With that I would like to thank you and turn it over to Craig for financial highlights. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings with net income of $295 million, this compares to net income of $89 million for the third quarter of 2015. Net income includes realized capital gains and losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $623 million compared to $621 million in 2015. After-tax operating income for the third quarter was $273 million compared to $200 million in 2015. Operating income year-to-date was $630 million compared to $755 million in 2015, a primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $432 million for the first nine-months compared to an underwriting gain of $498 million for the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, the overall results reflected gross catastrophe losses of $151 million in 2016 compared to $61 million in 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the Group saw $18 million of catastrophe losses, these losses primarily related to the Hurricane Hermine in Florida, this compares to $34 million of catastrophes during the third quarter of 2015. The overall current year attritional combined ratio for the first nine-months was 85.2%, down from 85.8% for the same period in 2015. The 2015 attritional ratio included $60 million loss estimate for the explosions at the Chinese port of Tianjin. Our year-to-date expense ratio was 5.8% as we anticipated with the build out of our insurance platform and our Lloyd's Syndicate. For investment, pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter and $358 million year-to-date on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income year-to-date declined only $5 million from one year ago. We have been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in our overall investment portfolio. However, as Dom mentioned, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket to de-risk the portfolio. We have reduced our exposure to emerging market debt and public equity while committing more toward fixed income, limited partnership investment, all while maintaining a conservative, well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% and duration remained at about three year. Foreign exchange is reported in other income, foreign exchange gains were $2 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date foreign exchange losses were $29 million, compared to $62 million of foreign exchange gains in the first nine-months of 2015. Both of these results are unusual and represent $91 million pre-tax swing year-over-year. The 2016 foreign exchange losses primarily reflect the relative strengthening of U.S. dollar against other world currencies including the British Pounds and the Euro. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch, since it's offset in shareholders equity through translation adjustments and unrealized gains due to the positive impact of holding foreign investments that are available for sale. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets with liabilities in most major world currency. Other income also included $10 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in first nine-months of 2016, compared to $15 million of income for the same period last year. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses during 2016. On income taxes, the 13.2% year-to-date annualized effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the 14.8% tax rate at this time last year. This is primarily due to foreign exchange losses and the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016. A 13 to 15% effective tax rate on operating income for the full-year is in line with our expectations, depending on the amount of catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows at $951 million for the first nine-months of 2016, compared to $802 million in 2015, which in part is reflective of our strong reserve position compared to actual paid losses. Shareholders equity for the group was $8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $433 million or 6% over year end 2015. This is after taking into account capital return through $379 million of share buybacks, and the $144 million of dividend paid in the first nine-months of 2016, which combined represent a return of 84% of net income. Additionally, we repurchased another $7 million of stock after the third quarter close. These purchases will be reflected in the fourth quarter of 2016 financial statement. Book value per share increased 10% to $196.67 from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 12% growth in shareholder value including dividends. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operation. John Doucette : Thank you Craig, good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for our reinsurance operation, delivering $203 million of underwriting profit to the bottom line. This compares very favorably to Q3 last year, with profits up $87 million quarter-over-quarter. The difference is predominantly driven by higher cats and the loss of the Chinese port Tianjin last year, ultimately resulting in about an eight point improvement to the combined ratio to 80.1% this quarter. The attritional combined ratio also dropped from 85.2% to 78.9% as the Tianjin losses added six points to the third quarter attritional loss ratio last year. Despite the soft market conditions, we successfully executed our reinsurance strategy with our global reach, long standing client and broker relationship, responsiveness, strong and sizeable balance sheet and innovative capital structures, sustaining and even modestly growing our premium writing. For the quarter, our total reinsurance segment gross written premium was $1.25 billion, up 1% from Q3 last year, on a constant currency basis premiums grew 2%. Our total reinsurance net written premium was $1.22 billion for Q3, up 13% from last Q3. The net premium result was affected by the Heartland sale and the assumption of this crop portfolio out of the insurance segment and into the U.S. reinsurance segment. Year-to-date, our gross reinsurance premium was down 3% but down only 1% on adjusted for currency movement. On a net basis year-to-date reinsurance premium were up 1%. The U.S. reinsurance premium growth was strong in the quarter, up 9%, due to growth in structured reinsurance transaction in particular in the mortgage and credit space. In addition, the increased premium on facultative casualty and crop reinsurance business. This was offset by lower premium on weather, Marine, surety and property pro rata business. Notably the structured reinsurance deals required broad expertise and scale to execute and often provide significant benefit over and above the pure risk transfer and consequently are not subject to the same pressures as the remainder of the reinsurance market. The segment combined ratio was up to 78.4% from 73.8% Q3 last year. We had 3.4 points of cat losses versus none in the prior Q3. This driven this quarter by Hurricane Hermine and some development on events that occurred earlier in the year due to late reporting. Our attritional loss ratio was up almost five points due to non-cat weather events in Texas and the Midwest in addition to a higher loss ratio on the new crop reinsurance premium. Conversely the crop reinsurance premium has lower expenses contributing to the 2.3% decline in the commission expense ratio. Our international reinsurance segment premium was down 4% for the quarter, but only 2% on a constant dollar basis. This was primarily due to lower property pro rata business in the Middle East, which was offset by growth in our Latin America and international factors. Overall, we had better attritional ratios due in part for the Tianjin loss last year as well as better experience in certain region. Lower cat, including the least prior year catastrophe reserves further benefitted results this quarter. Our Bermuda segment premiums were down 9% or 7% on a constant dollar basis, driven by lower motor business in Europe. Excluding FX, we saw growth in London this quarter. Overall, the combined ratio improved 6.8 points to 19.7%. The current year attritional loss ratio was down about 15 points with roughly half due to the impact of the Tianjin loss in last Q3. This was somewhat offset by higher commission expenses due to changes in business mix. Recently, the reinsurance industry was confronted with its first significant borrow to win loss over a decade, but Matthew will be a lesser impact to the industry than initially feared. Nonetheless, we are comfortable that our exposures are well controlled given the gross portfolio we have built as well as the various mitigation tact that\u2019s being forth. Additionally, our global diversification across various lines of insurance and reinsurance buffers the group loss and such event making them manageable. Although, Matthew will not be a game changing loss for most collateralized or traditional players, it may tests the functioning of various collateral mechanisms. As a buyer of both traditional and collateralized reinsurance, we are familiar with the complications and potential headaches of collateralized arrangement. These complications compound with uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of a large event such as Matthew, given new season and untested claims management process. However, while Mt. Logan provide significant collateralized support ultimately serving our client, it stands behind Everest and is in visible through our season, unburdening them from the inherent complexity of such arrangement. With the suite of solution to best match the risk capital including our $8 billion of equity, Mt. Logan, our catastrophe bond and other internal and external sources of capital, we offer our client meaningful capacity from a trusted partner. And we continue to look for ways to broaden our value proposition to our clients with these various solutions. Mt. Logan in particular continues to draw interest of new investors including various pension fund and we look forward to increasing the scale and the scope of the benefit that Logan provides to Everest client and shareholders. With respect to the current activity in the market and looking ahead to 1/1 renewal, the reinsurance market seems to be trying to find the floor with many underwriters resisting furthering the rate concessions over the last several renewals. Many competitor's management teams are increasingly realizing that the returns may no longer cover their cost of capital, assuming a normalize level of cat losses and also seeing that they can easily miss earnings estimates with a few large risk losses or small medium cat event. Everest with its significant expense advantage and broadly diversified global portfolio continues to produce solid returns despite to competitive rate environment. As the business is also stabilizing and the market is taking a stand against further increases [indiscernible] session. We have also seen some aggressive firm order terms for casualty placement face stiff resistance in the casualty treaty markets. In addition, some of the loss activity seen by our clients, spark demands for facultative casualty reinsurance, and we continue to see increased demand in the mortgage credit area. The casualty reinsurance pricing stabilization is offset somewhat by the moderate decreases in a regional casualty and E&S rate. We also remain cautious of new large capacity in the broker markets. Nevertheless, as large insurers continue to bundle their program, they are seeking partners like Everest, who have underwriting expertise in all classes of business and in multiple territories around the world. This plays into our strength as a large diversified global reinsurer that addresses the market with decades of relationships and creative, responsive underwriting all at a significant scale. Thank you. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operation. Jonathan Zaffino : Thanks John and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to share with you third quarter results for the Everest Global Insurance Operations, similar to last quarter and a consideration of the divestiture of Heartland on August 24th. I will be discussing our quarterly results excluding this business. The full results of the insurance segment inclusive of Heartland are covered in our financial supplement released yesterday. As respect premium production overall, our many strategic initiatives align towards a singular objective of building a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization continue to gain momentum. Many of the new underwriting divisions incepted over the past several months are showing increased contributions to our growth and ultimately to profitability. Third quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of underlying growth for our global insurance business again excluding Heartland. As a result of these efforts, gross written premium in the quarter expanded 25% over the prior year quarter to $371 million. This is reflective of the continued investments we have made in our U.S. and London platforms along with the continued strong contributions from our Canadian and Accident and Health operations. Net written premiums for the quarter increased 23% compared to third quarter of 2015 to $318 million, which is in line with our net-to-gross ratio for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premiums increased by $185 million or 19% over the prior year period to $1.1 billion. Likewise, net written premiums increased a $129 million or 15% to $970 million which again was in line with our expectation. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was a 101%, which improves to 99.5% on an attritional basis. Year-to-date the GAAP combined ratio was 102.2 again on an attritional basis excluding the impact from previously announced cat events and prior year development, the year-to-date combined ratio improved to 97.1%. This is inclusive of the expenses associated with the build out of our U.S. and Lloyd\u2019s platforms, which added nearly two points to the expense ratio year-over-year. We do anticipate our Lloyd\u2019s operation will absorb much of this increase as earned premium increasingly works its way through thus mitigating the impact here. The loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter was 71.3% which improves to 69.8% on an attritional basis. The loss and loss expense ratio for the quarter was impacted by some notable property per risk losses and a slight change for the loss ratio for our medical stop loss business. This was a result of a reevaluation of our experience over the first six months of this year and our expectations of this business going forward. It should be noted that this particular unit continues to deliver strong results for us including post this adjustment. On a year-to-date basis the GAAP loss and loss expense ratio was 73.3% with an attrition of 68.2% essentially flat year-over-year with the difference being predominantly 4.4 points of cat activity or events in the second quarter. I'll now provide some color on the performance of our major insurance portfolio starting with the North America P&G book which is our largest business. The core P&G portfolio delivered 19% growth in the quarter building upon a similar number from the second quarter of this year. Growth was balanced across short tails, specialty and casualty lines. Further our new business lines launched in the U.S. which have been discussed on recent calls, contributed nearly 11% of gross written premium in the quarter double the contribution from the second quarter of 2016. We are encouraged by the growing momentum within these portfolios and hence the opportunities ahead. The Accident and Health Group delivered another solid quarter of growth with the near 30% increase over the prior year comparable quarter, continuing the consistent trend we have experienced throughout the year. Our efforts awfully grow our medical stop loss segment have been successful and have our efforts to complement this growth with new products across Medicare supplement, sport disability and short-term medical markets. Our Lloyd\u2019s operation also continue to expansion. Syndicate contributed $16.4 million to insurance growth in the quarter demonstrating the increased momentum we are gaining within this platforms despite the difficult trading environment. Year-to-date the Lloyd\u2019s has now delivered nearly $35 million of premiums in reinsurance segment yet only $9.7 million earned premium which again temporarily impacts the expense ratio. We are encouraged by the growth trajectory of this platform and we will maintain our discipline in seeking profitable opportunities for growth. From the rate side, we see a very similar picture to what we have witnessed in the second quarter of this year. Within the U.S. market, we continued to achieve positive rate on auto lines both commercial and personal as well as on the general liability side. The professional liability market continues to be competitive with the rate decreases in the mid-single digit range across lines being common. The U.S. property market remains in a prolonged soft cycle; however, the magnitude of rate decreases continue to moderate from the third quarter. Large individual risk losses coupled with the severity of North American cat losses this year, punctuated by the first main storm making land fall in Florida in over a decade has provided a dampening to the rate decreases often sought. Thus despite a competitive market dynamic, we believe opportunities for profitable growth through a diversified portfolio remain. As respects to Canadian market, again a similar story to second quarter. The market remains competitive for most lines of business, but the major lines liability rates remain essentially flat to prior quarter. Canadian property rates have generally flattened in cat exposed areas within certain provinces, yet outside of these areas, there remain some moderate rate pressure. We will keep a close eye in January first renewal cycle to see how the market reacts to the record cat losses within Canada this year. Particularly the upcoming reinsurance renewals and any corrective rate measures that may follow. Management liability lines remain very competitive while other specialty lines are likewise still on the rate pressure but ultimately a bit moderated. So again, it\u2019s a bit of mix situation yet trending similar to prior quarters. A notable difference here is the uncertainty of the property market as we enter year-end. In conclusion, we look forward to carrying our strong top-line momentum into the fourth quarter and into 2017. We are encouraged by the underlying trends of the many businesses we have cultivated over the past many months, and especially with the talented leaders we have attracted to Everest to lead these missions for us. As we continue to add skills through our grown operations, we expect these ventures to become a more meaningful profit contributor to our global portfolio. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A. Elizabeth Farrell : Thank you, Jon. Keith, we are open now to take questions from the audience. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and we will take our first question Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kai, please check the mute button on your phone. Okay we will go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Yes, good morning. First off, I was hoping to in terms of your premium outlook, and it was the commentary on marketing systems Re. But as we think about going forward, do you think the reinsurance growth will kind of stay at about 2% or so ex-currency and the insurance growth kind of stay in-line with them the Q3 level as we think about the Q4 in 2017? Dominic Addesso : Elyse, we don\u2019t really try to give guidance on where we think our premium growth will come from. We do of course think that directionally on the insurance side is that will be the side of our business that will grow at an increased pace relative to reinsurance. It's hard to say at this point until we get a little further long into renewal season, depending on where rates are and depending on what the opportunities that are presented to us. So, I think a conservative view like you are describing is not unreasonable, but there is a lot of variability around that numbers. Elyse Greenspan : Okay great. And then in terms of the international reinsurance segment, the underlying loss ratio in that segment was pretty strong about a 47% in the quarter, was there anything one-time impacting that number? Craig Howie : Else, this is Craig. What happened this quarter was in the past we had seen a number of one-off type losses that were non-catastrophe type losses that held up the attritional ratio in that segment. We were able to bring that loss ratio down more in-line with where it should be absent those losses. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then in terms of the insurance business, now that the crop sale has been completed, do you think we are at a point where on a go forward basis that segment maybe running a little bit off of your long-term goals, but the margins stabilize on a profitable level from here? And then combined with that at what timeframe do you think we will see the expense ratio normalize there for some of the hiring that you have done in that business? Dominic Addesso : Well certainly for the next several quarters I think we will see the expense ratio remain where it is. Remembering that we will continue to pursue growth, so there will be quite a few quarters frankly where the written and the earned will be at a line so to speak, in other words the written will be well above we earned. Our expense growth through the nine-months have actually been consistent with our top-line growth. So the raise in the expense ratio is explained purely by that. I would also add, if you compare our expense ratio to many of our competitors or peer companies, we are well below industry average from the expense ratio point of view. So we are not discouraged by the amount of the investment we have make in order to grow this business. And as far as the overall combined ratio, we should expect that given the fact that crop is now out of the picture, we should expect that to be more stable and frankly even improve overtime, particularly as we grow some more of the specialty lines of business that we are focused on. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great thank you. And then one other thing, is at all possible in the supplement in the future, maybe you could include the insurance results the prior year, quarter just on a pro forma basis including the crop business to help with the comparables that would be pretty helpful. Thanks very much. Dominic Addesso : We appreciate the suggestion and we will certainly talk about that. The other thing I want to add at least to your question is that - not to add to your question but to add in response to your question is that the other thing keep in mind that affects reinsurance premium growth, we have a fair bit of pro rata business, so depending on what happens with some of those accounts that can have an impact on the percentage growth. So you have to keep that in mind as well. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks very much. Dominic Addesso : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll try to go back to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan : Thank you, can you hear me now? Dominic Addesso : Yes, Kai. Kai Pan : That's good. Thank you. Sorry for the earlier trouble. Maybe expense control on my side. So, just to follow up on Hurricane Matthew losses, $75 million to $200 million in net losses. I just wonder, could you give a little bit more detail in terms of in Florida or North Carolina? Is it wind or flooding? And how does that compare with your expectation? Because you have been pretty proactively shaping your portfolio in that part of the region. Dominic Addesso : Well I'm going to make a few comments and then ask John Doucette to jump in here. But I think frankly it's a little early to maybe get into the specifics that you are after. The estimates that were used were based on modeled output as I said the industry range we frankly use greater but $9 billion I know there is a number lower than that on both the low side and the high side, we just rounded it as three to nine so that you had the full range of what the outcomes might be. I don't think the loss here is outside our expectations, frankly, our market share numbers again on this net basis that we are describing here is somewhere between 2% and 3%, probably middle of that would be a good estimate to use. So that's kind of the range of the outcome and that's not outside of our expectation. John, do you have anything further to add to that? John Doucette : Thanks Dom, good morning Kai, just a little bit more on the loss. Most of the loss would be a reinsurance loss to us most likely, although we would have potentially some insurance losses, potentially in South Carolina and in terms of the overall split of the of the loss. We would point you that some of it would be coming from the Bahamas, where Everest is one of the larger reinsurers and have been for a long time in the Caribbean. So maybe about 25% of the loss and again that number will move around, but I'm just trying to give some directional guidance, but the majority of the loss would be a reinsurance loss coming from our Florida clients. Kai Pan : Okay, that's great. And then given we had some sizable losses this year, it looks like January 1 renewal rates probably further stabilize. I just wonder, given the current market environment, basically flat pricing, would you expect to keep your reinsurance attritional combined ratio stable going forward? Or it will continue to have some pressure on the core margin side? Dominic Addesso : I would think that it would be relatively stable and again keep in mind that I think in large part that\u2019s a question about property cat. And things can change a lot based on other lines of business growing the casualty portfolio, growing mortgage, credit. All those things have an impact on the reinsurance attritional combined loss ratio and result to combined ratio. So a mix can play a big factor as well as what I mentioned to at least pro rata, some of those accounts go away or get reduced that has the favorable impact as well. Kai Pan : Okay, that's great. My last question, and we have seen recently some tick up in terms of the merger acquisition activities in the space, and also in the press. There's a specialty insurance business, like a potential looking for sale. I just wonder, looking at your strategy, build-versus buy, are you interested in some of the -- like a potential business out there, you might be interested, as through acquisitions as well? Or any particular platform you would like to look into, to grow? Dominic Addesso : Well, of course it's hypothetical, because it all depends on what is out there. Generally, I would have to say that most if not all properties that where companies are seeking strategic options, given Everest size and scale we get an opportunity to look at. And obviously we've made a decision to continue on the path that we are on. In most cases or in many cases it can be result of price, it can be cultural fit, integration is a challenge, and in many cases in acquisition you have to look not only to what you can combine but what you have to eliminate and what we prefer to stay focused on is what we can add to our existing portfolio. In addition, over the last 18 months or so the market has presented many opportunities to hire some great talent. We are very pleased with that and frankly that\u2019s a more cost effective alternative, without having to put on a goodwill on the book. Kai Pan : Okay, thank you. Yes, thank you so much. And if I may, just quick last one, is that your survival ratio on asbestos has dropped to 5.1 in the quarter. I just wonder, what do you see the trends here, and when do you do your annual reserve study? Thanks.. Craig Howie : For asbestos, we always look at asbestos on a quarterly basis Kai. We do the annual review during the fourth quarter, we always continue to look any and all trends that are out there, as well as any clients that are taking charges that we would have exposure too, but again we will look at that in the fourth quarter. Dominic Addesso : And anything material as Craig says during any particular quarter we would have to put something there. But again it is subject to the yearend reserve reviews as well. Kai Pan : Thank you so much. Dominic Addesso : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you so much. Just a couple of numbers once if I could Craig you mentioned the tax rate would be in that sort of 13% to 15% range. If there are more losses in the U.S. proportionally than any typical fourth quarter, I would think the tax would be lower or is there something else that would cause the tax rate in the fourth quarter. Craig Howie : Michael that\u2019s correct, if there are more losses or higher end of the catastrophe losses, we would be at the lower end of that late that I said 13% to 15%. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. The year-to-date is around 13, right so it wouldn\u2019t be lower than what you experience through the year-to-date, it would just be at that same level? Craig Howie : It really depends on how high it is and with respect to our planned losses in the fourth quarter. So again, that\u2019s a annualized effective rates. So guidance that I gave was 13% to 15%, would be on the lower end if we had higher catastrophe loss. Michael Nannizzi : Got you, okay thanks. And then we don\u2019t see Mt. Logan on a standalone base anymore, but can you give us some color on sort of what the performance was in that portfolio in third quarter and whether you would expect the fourth quarter and the impact of Matthew to be similar there as it is in your on balance sheet book? Craig Howie : So what we take through are the earnings and fees that we take are through other income. So far, year-to-date we've taken for $10 million compared to $15 million last year, the reason that it's lower this year is because the anticipated estimates for losses in the Logan book will remaining fees that we get until those losses are settled. So essentially that\u2019s what you are seeing for Logan so far this year. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. And then any change to 4Q deployment expectations given your sort of early read on Matthew or is that within your sort of load enough that it doesn\u2019t change your perspective on deployment? Craig Howie : I am not sure, the deployment you mean\u2026 Michael Nannizzi : Sorry, a buyback capital share repurchase? Craig Howie : No, I think what my comments and my remarks related to really the annual earnings, so quarter only as it impacts the annual earnings. So again, we look at the entire year, not just a quarter. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. And then just one last if I could, just following up on Elyse's question on the international segment. The losses look like it was mid-40s pretty low by historical standards even going back to like hard market years. Was it that losses there were sort of more normal relative to higher losses in that linked quarter last year or were they actually sort of even lower than a more normal year, more normal environment? Craig Howie : Yes, so in the past, we had elevated losses including losses all around the world, Latin America as well as you know floods in Middle East and North Africa as well. So in essence what has happened is we have seen lower levels of those losses as well as a different mix of business that\u2019s coming through those books and what you are seeing is ratio that\u2019s more in-line with where it should have been in the past. Michael Nannizzi : Got it, great. Thank you so much for the answers. Craig Howie : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : My only question is Baden Baden, in terms of the Continental European Reinsurance Conference, is ongoing. Any live feedback you can provide us in terms of what the expectations are coming out of there? John Doucette : Well, good morning Jay, it's Jon. So it's going on right now, so we haven't had too much feedback from our team to build there. But we do send a meaningful team from recovering both Continental Europe plus Middle Eastern African clients and others that make their way there as well. So I think one of the messages that we have is the continued build out of our capabilities, we've added various people in our European operation and with that have added product lines that we can support. So I think the larger buyers are continuing to consolidate their placement which we are a net beneficiary of and the fact that we have meaningful capacity to deploy with Mt. Logan and Everest also helps us be even more relevant to the client. And as I said we have been viewed as a stable partner and with the increase in our capabilities we expect to have more trading opportunity with our European and Middle East, Africa clients. Jay Gelb : That's helpful. Thank you. Dominic Addesso : Thanks Jay. Operator : And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for taking my question, if we think about 2017 and beyond, as we look at the expense ratio in insurance, how much of a drag is there from the significant growth going on, and so where do you think next year as Heartland changing into whatnot, where does that shake out. Dominic Addesso : Well, as I mentioned before currently and I don't know that I would describe it as a drag, given the fact that as I pointed out we have even on the insurance side, one of the lowest expense ratios in the business. So our expense ratio insurance wise year-over-year is elevated by two points. I would expect that differential to remain there for few quarters if not several quarters, because we certainly would expect the written premium growth to far outpace the earned premium growth and our actual expenses are growing consistent with the written premium growth. So when the earned premium starts to stabilize relative to the written, then you will start to see that expense ratio come in a bit. Joshua Shanker : Given the current size of the book at 200 basis points sort of build out expense on top, is that the right way to think about it. Dominic Addesso : That's how we're thinking about it right now, correct. And by the way my point though is that you are calling it a build out, but in one word you could use is investment, the reality is, is that those expenses will be covered once the earned premium comes in to match it. or said a different way our expense growth is consistent with our written premium growth. Joshua Shanker : And I think there is I have to go review the last quarter as well, but as Heartland comes out, as I'm looking back trying to compare 3Q 2017 to 3Q 2016 on the expense ratio how is that going to direct it. Dominic Addesso : The expense ratio, maybe I'll answer it by a combined ratio basis, because I think this is what you were getting at, if not come back again. But right now our attritional combined ratio is in the mid 90s, 95, 96 somewhere in there. Joshua Shanker : You need a 101 for the quarter. Dominic Addesso : But I'm talking about ex cats and et cetera. So we think that our base book is running right now in the mid 90s, we would expect overtime frankly that number to improve more dramatically from improvements in the book of business and affecting the loss ratio, because that I think is where we see the major benefit coming from. Joshua Shanker : And the quarter\u2019s share relationship with Heartland incepts on 1/1 that's right? John Doucette : The new quarter share in our business, in other words the Heartland was actually sold on August 24, so essentially what happens at that date is that insurance business then transfers over to be reinsurance business on the Everest books. And then we have quarter share with the new company to take in certain percentage of their overall book going forward in 2017. Joshua Shanker : On the first debut? John Doucette : Right. Joshua Shanker : Will that be a considerable thing; are we going to notice that in a large way? I mean I don\u2019t know how to model that exactly. In this relation besides of Heartland how big this new crop business is? Jonathan Zaffino : This is Jon. I think for the next year or so we would expect it to be about the same size maybe a little bit larger than what the Heartland book was. Joshua Shanker : Okay. Thank you for the answer, I appreciate it. Dominic Addesso : Thank you, Josh. Operator : And we will take our next question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead. Quentin McMillan : Thanks very much guys. Sorry to beat the dead horse in terms of the expense ratio question and the insurance segment, but I\u2019m just thinking about it on an absolute dollar basis. The dollar that you spent were about $44.5 million in the third quarter. Is the dollar value a better maybe run rate basis of a way for us to think about it, because obviously you have been very active in hiring. Just not sure if there was also any incentive bonuses that were paid that maybe gets stripped out next year or anything else in there that we should think about outside of the ratio, but just on an absolute dollar basis to help? John Doucette : By the way Quentin thanks for referencing to us as a dead horse. Quentin $44 million that Quentin is referencing, I think includes our - rate so we have to carve that out. But as we carve that out back to the point yes you are right, expense dollars or definitely up, as Dom said expense dollars are going to be up as net written premium is up as well, because we are growing that book. I don\u2019t think you are seeing in outsized increase and expenses with respect to the increase in net premium. So from a percentage basis the overall ratio, the expense ratio has gone up just over two points. And that\u2019s the way we are looking at it for now that it will stay at that level until we build out this book and then as you see the build out of this book in some of these new programs that business will earn in overtime. And as it earns in that\u2019s when you will see that expense ratio start to moderate. Dominic Addesso : And the other way that you might want to think about Quentin is in terms of building models, you might want to also consider modeling the expenses or looking at our expense ratio relative to written as oppose to earned. Quentin McMillan : That\u2019s a good thought. Thank you and then just in terms of coming back to 1/1, it sounds like Jon your expectations sounds like its four or flattish, renewal which will be better than we have obviously seen recently. Can you just talk about any change in sentiment or perception, obviously Matthew was on a crash course to a lot more damage than what ultimately happened when it turned East. Do you think that there is psychological impact from that that we are going to feel at 1/1 where when you go to clients you will be able to have a more honest conversation that the risk is real and that there is more ability to give more in pricing. I mean just should I talk about that dynamic at the 1/1 renewal please. Jonathan Zaffino : Sure, I think it is something that\u2019s real. Remember this is the first real land fall in 10 years, so I think that\u2019s factoring into the psychology of the conversations and psychology of the buys of some of the clients. I mean look there is a lot of capital out there and we ultimately don\u2019t know how we will go, but there will be profits we think we will better than others. We do think that U.S. is stabilizing particularly in the property and on the casualty as per the by our conversations about exceeding commissions on casualty rates and push back we have seen. So I mean we saw some of that as 6/1 and 7/1 on both the property and the casualty side. So international, it really depends on the geographic territory or where do we think rates are going to be flat or not. So but as you think to your point, I do think that it's not just the Matthew, but it's also risk losses, we have seen some large risk losses that can do some real damage to reinsurers as a quarterly income, and I think that also is starting to factor into the conversation. Quentin McMillan : Thanks guys, and if I could just speak one last one on the mortgage insurance opportunity. You guys have sort of indicated in the past that you would preferred to play it on the reinsurance side I believe, because you can be a little bit more nimble to enter and exit the market as you see opportunistic options available to you. But can you just sort of give us a sense of what size you are and potential sort of what you might look to grow that book of business over the next couple of years? Craig Howie : So, we have written a couple of these deals and multi-years deals and so they earn in over seven year period or longer. And so earned premium certainly from the GSEs has not been that high, but from the deals we have already executed we expect to see in future premium is coming in from those, from some of the MIs. They spend been more on quota share basis, those have been larger to date. And it really depends on what their capital needs are going forward as to whether those are going to be a growth opportunity or not, it really depend on a lot of different things. Certainly the regulations have caused them to delever from 25 to one to about 18 to one and they are using reinsurance to buffer that capital support, we like that. So to answer your question about opportunity in capacity, we see a lot of run rate there on the reinsurance side, and we expect to continue to put forth capacity at the appropriate price. Quentin McMillan : Great. Thank you so much guys. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll return the program to our presenters for any closing remarks. Dominic Addesso : Thank you to all that participating in the call. And kind of in summary, let just say that we are very obviously pleased with the quarter. Notwithstanding that to these challenges remaining at there as you all know. Certainly, market pricing is to top of the list and insurance growth for us is a journey that requires a lot of lot of hard work. We remain confident however that as far as cycles are concern, we had proven that we can effectively manage through these cycles, managing our exposures and our P&Ls and taking advantage of the opportunities that the market is giving us. On the insurance side, we remain focused on specialty areas in particular because this gives us better opportunity to avoid commodity type pricing. Ratings and scale make a difference and give us an opportunity to grow our insurance book, and while, as evident by the questions, expenses are up; but the growth there as I said is consistent with our written premium growth as it should be, the earns just has to catch up. And again, I want to emphasis that we are still best-in-class on the expense ratio side. So that\u2019s something organizationally we pay attention to in both businesses. Overall, our flexibility allows us to commit our capital and resources to the best opportunity and our plan is to just continue this approach which has been successful for us in the past. Thanks for your interest in Everest and have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen this will continue today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Ltd. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Farrell : Thank you, Jessica. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before I begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Beth and good morning to all. We are pleased to provide our final report for the 2016 year, where we closed the year with a record fourth quarter and an industry leading 13% ROE for the year. There are many moving pieces in those results, which my colleagues will take you through. But let me highlight a few key themes. In the quarter and a year that saw a heightened level of cat activity relative to the prior year, yet the overall impact of these events was easily absorbed into our results, given the benefits of our diversified global platform that provides for premium across many geographies and lines. Notably, we reached a new high this year with over $6 billion of gross premium written. In addition, we realized the benefit of sizable reserve redundancies this quarter, a reflection of our conservative reserving practices, which we have been pointing to for some time now. While we had sizable reserve releases from our reinsurance portfolio, our insurance portfolio did experience some unfavorable loss reserve development. But this was largely isolated to construction defect claims arising out of runoff books of business. The size of the charge this year reflects our best effort to fully fund these liabilities and put this behind us. We also topped up our asbestos reserves. This reserve addition was not the result of any change we have experienced in the underlying claims, but rather reflects a reallocation of reserves to the segment that is fraught with uncertainty. Despite all these reserve movements, the net result was a positive $209 million to full year earnings. As a result of these reserve savings and frankly many other important factors, our core operations have done very well as you will note in the numbers. Overall, reinsurance generated an underwriting gain of over $900 million, bettering last year\u2019s number by almost $40 million. While it is a challenged market from a rate perspective, as seen in the top line, we continue to expand our product set, shifting our risk appetite to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. These achievements are not one-off. There is a consistency to our performance relative to the market where our returns on capital have measurably outperformed. Albeit while returns are creeping down as a result of market conditions, I think it is pretty clear that the overall market will reach its breaking point before us. In the insurance front, we remain extremely satisfied with our progress. Premium growth, excluding our crop business, which was sold earlier this year, has been in excess of 20% due to new product and business launches. The benefits of these increased writings have not yet been fully captured due to the lag in earned premium. The underperformance in 2016 reflects this lag in earned premium and its impact on the expense ratio as well as the reserve adjustments I previously mentioned. However, we remain confident that the new business that will come through earnings in the year to come will outperform the historical record. Why this optimism in such a tough market for both reinsurance and insurance? First, the inevitable law of gravity and the race to the bottom, that is one race we don\u2019t intend to win and already have shown we are far behind. Based on industry returns relative to cost of capital, the race is almost over. That race includes third-party capital, where our future of higher investment rates will cause those markets to raise their targets. Second, the scale of our organization and scope of our relationships allows us the opportunity to selectively grow and introduce our new products and businesses. And finally, great people in a culture that inspires smart underwriting and risk selection with an eye towards being creative and entrepreneurial in everything we do, a lean organization that allows us to be nimble and quick to the right trade in the most expense-efficient rate possible. These are the qualities we continue to emphasize and that will continue to generate market leading returns. Thank you, and now to Craig for the financial highlights. Craig Howie : Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Everest had an excellent end to 2016 and a record quarter of earnings with net income of $374 million helped by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $357 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the year was $996 million compared to $978 million in 2015. After-tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $363 million compared to $353 million in 2015. For the year, operating income was $993 million compared to $1.1 billion in 2015. The primary differences were catastrophe losses and foreign exchange partially offset by favorable reserve releases. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $689 million for the year compared to underwriting gain of $787 million for 2015. The results reflect a slight increase in the overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.5%, up from 84.8% last year. This attritional measure increase of less than 1 point reflects a higher expense ratio as we anticipated, with the build-out of the insurance platform and our Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $185 million of gross current year catastrophe losses. Of the total, $150 million related to losses from Hurricane Matthew, $20 million related to earthquake activity in New Zealand and $15 million related to the Tennessee wildfires. Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $169 million. The fourth quarter of 2016 also included favorable development on prior cat losses largely from the 2015 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $150 million. Net catastrophe losses for the year were $301 million in 2016 compared to $54 million in 2015. For 2016, gross catastrophe losses were $420 million but were offset by reinsurance and $87 million of favorable development on prior year cat losses, primarily from the 2015 Chile earthquake and U.S. storm events, the 2013 U.S. storms and Toronto flooding and the 2011 Japan earthquake. Our reported combined ratio was 87.0% for the year 2016 compared to 85.1% in 2015. The 2016 commission ratio of 22.3% was essentially flat compared to 2015. Our expense ratio of 5.7% for the year is up from 4.8% in 2015. The expense ratio for the Reinsurance segment remained low at 3.1%, while the overall expense ratio was influenced by the build-out of our insurance segment. Everest maintains one of the lowest internal expense ratios in the industry. This is a strategic competitive advantage for Everest. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve studies. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked $205 million of favorable, prior year reserve development. This included prior period development in the insurance segment and for asbestos, which was more than offset by favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segments. The $160 million of prior year reserve development in the insurance segment during the quarter, as referenced by Dom, is largely related to construction liability and umbrella program business. These run-off programs were discontinued by the company several years ago. The $365 million of favorable prior year development in the reinsurance segments reflected $419 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $54 million increase in asbestos and environmental reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of the year. The $419 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter, mostly related to property and short tail business, both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don\u2019t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pretax investment income was $150 million for the quarter and $473 million for the year on our $17.5 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year remained flat compared to 2015, which was better than expected. We have been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. The recent rise in interest rates drove bond prices down and had a negative impact to book value during the quarter, related to the unrealized capital losses in our bond portfolio. However, this increase and the expected rising interest rates during 2017 will have a positive impact on the net investment income over time. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.8% and duration remained at just over 3 years. Other income and expense included $21 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2016 year compared to $61 million of foreign exchange gains in 2015. Both of these results are unusual and representing $82 million pretax swing year-over-year. For 2016, foreign exchange losses resulted from the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other world currencies, primarily the British pound. Overall, we maintained an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange, matching assets and liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included $11 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015. The decline in 2016 essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2016 and the corresponding reduction in incentive or profit sharing fees. On income taxes, the 2016 operating income effective tax rate was 10.3%. This effective tax rate for the year was lower than our expectations for the year. The tax rate was lower due to the amount and geographic region of the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed the U.S. tax audit during the quarter and allowed the utilization of foreign tax credits from years 2009 through 2012. These credits reduced the effect of tax rate by about 2 points. Strong cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $1.4 billion for the year, up $276 million compared to 2015. This is primarily due to our continued premium growth. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.1 billion at the end of 2016, up $467 million or 6% over year end 2015. This was after taking into account capital return through $386 million of share buybacks and $195 million of dividends paid in 2016. The company announced a 9% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per share increased 11% to $197.45 from $178.21 at year end 2015, generating 13% growth in shareholder value, including dividends. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities as well as continuing share repurchases. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report an outstanding quarter and a record year, with $903 million of reinsurance underwriting profit despite catastrophe activities. Our earnings reflect our strengthening position in the global reinsurance market and are a testament to our continued disciplined efforts to build a diverse and profitable portfolio. Globally, REITs were under pressure except where material catastrophes occurred, such as Canada. Our position as a large, global, nimble, highly rated and long standing reinsurer allows us to successfully underwrite through this tough rating environment to grow profitable business and once again, to achieve market beating results. Before discussing renewals, here is some color on the fourth quarter and 2016 results. Total gross written premium for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to last year, but flat on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, global reinsurance premiums of $4.2 billion were down 3%, but flat after eliminating the currency impacts. For the quarter, the loss ratio increased to 36.3% from 33% in prior Q4 and included 12.5 points of cat losses and also about 5 points of asbestos strengthening, both of which were more than offset by 38 points of favorable prior year reserve releases. The impact of fourth quarter cats was $139 million, which included $158 million of Hurricane Matthew, the Q4 New Zealand earthquake and the Tennessee fires, offset by reductions of $19 million for prior year cat events. The favorable prior year reserve development emanated across the portfolio, weighted towards our shorter tail lines. The level of these releases demonstrates the strength and diversity of our global portfolio, the foundation for our strong balance sheet. For the full year 2016, our reinsurance loss ratio improved from 50.6% a year ago to 50.1%. Excluding cats and prior year development, the current year attritional loss ratio was down slightly to 53.5%. Each year was impacted by a significant risk loss, with 2016 having $40 million of loss for the Jubilee Oil platform and 2015 having $60 million for the Tianjin, China explosion. Note, in 2016, our prior year reserve adjustment reflected the release of $43 million of that $60 million Tianjin loss estimate. The 2016 reported combined ratio and the 2016 attritional combined ratio, excluding cats and prior year development were also lower relative to the prior year, reflecting our disciplined underwriting approach and rigorous expense management. Bottom line, our reinsurance profit produced an all-time high underwriting profit of $429 million in the fourth quarter and $903 million for the full year 2016, placing us among the best performers in the reinsurance industry. We believe we have one of the very best reinsurance teams in the industry. In addition to a very strong technical staff, we have talented, experienced, smart underwriters who know their markets and clients well and with outstanding skills to underwrite risks, build profitable books and grow the long-term franchise, collectively enabling Everest to continue to outperform the market. In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, 2016 gross written premium was down slightly to $2.1 billion. Changes year-over-year were caused by a decrease in our property writings as we walked away from a significant volume of under-priced pro rata business. However, this was offset by our new strategic property insurance deal and the continued growth in alternative risk products, including credit-related business such as mortgage reinsurance. Our alternative risk capabilities remain a differentiating bright spot in a difficult market where more sophisticated clients increasingly seek bespoke products for capital relief, unique risks and often multiple lines of business. Everest\u2019s lean and agile operations, coupled with our broad experience and expertise, quickly provide solutions to both our long-term trusted partners and new clients seeking a creative solution. The 2016 combined ratio of the U.S. Reinsurance segment was up 6.6 points, while the accident year attritional combined ratio of 78.4% was up only 2 points. The attritional increase, in large part, was caused by the increased crop reinsurance writings, which generally requires less capital to write, but produces a slightly higher combined ratio. Our International Reinsurance segment premium was $1.2 billion, down 8% for the year, but only 5% on a constant dollar basis. Lower premium across many of our regions, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and Asia was due to both rate pressure and termination of under-priced business. For 2016, this segment produced $314 million of underwriting profit, up 86% over the prior year despite increased catastrophes. This was largely due to a significant level of current and prior year reserve releases, highlighting the conservatism in our reserving process. Excluding cats and prior year losses, the attritional combined ratio for 2016 was down 4 points to 80.4%, with the improvement due to the impact of Tianjin losses in 2015 and a lower level of attritional cat losses, catastrophes that do not reach our $10 million threshold, to be classified as a cat in 2016. Our Bermuda segment premium was $890 million, up 1% for the year, but on a constant dollar basis actually had growth of 5%, driven primarily by casualty reinsurance. The combined ratio was up about 1 point, but excluding cats and prior year development, the accident year attritional loss ratio was down 2.4 points to 89%. This was the result of changes in business mix and the impact of the Tianjin loss in 2015. Moving on to the 1/1 renewal, Everest was well-positioned to withstand the market pressures. Globally, our clients are demanding solutions that address their operational breadth, the increasingly complex capital requirements and unusual risks. We have the expertise, responsiveness and capital to meet these demands quickly aided by our unique and client focused operational structure, geographic and product breadth and diverse capital sources, including Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro, catastrophe bonds and other hedges. In the property markets, we continue to perform well in face of heavy competition. Facilitated by robust relationships, we re-underwrote our property portfolio substantially at 1/1 reallocating capacity from under-priced business to more attractive layers and programs, while supporting our core clients and newly marketed programs. We will also explore new structures that will strengthen our core client relationships well into the future. Overall, the market property rates were down at 1/1, on average mid single-digits across most markets unaffected by material losses. Our portfolio fared better than that, where the combined ratio of our 1/1 renewal portfolio had modest slippage of less than 1 point compared to last year\u2019s portfolio. In our casualty markets, the 1/1 pressures were mixed, with the reinsurance terms easing somewhat, but economics in certain underlying segments are still tracking in the wrong direction. We achieved improvements on classes with material losses and increasingly focused on structured and credit-related deals. Our London operation saw excess of loss rates declined from 2.5% to 5%, although some other international markets are seeing decreases of 5% to 10%. On the positive side, Solvency II is causing a demand uptick in London in European markets, specifically the pro rata structures. Overall, Everest reinsurance operations remain optimally diversified by product, distribution, geography, client mix, and capital sources giving us the ability to quickly identify and move from market weaknesses to market opportunity. We recognized the markets may face continued pressure from the supply demand imbalances. But as reflected in our results, we are well equipped to adapt and excel in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to John to review our insurance operations. John Doucette : Thanks, Jon and good morning. 2016 was the transformative year for the Everest Global Insurance operations. The year finished on a strong note despite the impact of profitability from elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses and as you have heard from Dom and Craig, prior year reserve development originating from the one-off books of business. Nonetheless, we are pleased with the underlying performance of our portfolio, particularly so in a difficult trading environment. Further, we continue to make significant progress on our journey to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization. I will provide further commentary on this progress later in my remarks. Similar to last quarter, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our results, excluding this business. The full results of the Insurance segment, inclusive of Heartland, are covered in our financial supplement released yesterday. Additionally, for reference, we have also included a supplemental exhibit with the quarterly insurance results, excluding Heartland. For the full year 2016, the global insurance operations achieved record premium levels, registering nearly $1.6 billion in gross written premium, an increase of $274 million or 21% over 2015. It should be noted that this result exceeds 2015 gross written premium, including the result of Heartland. This strong top line performance is an acknowledgment of the value our clients, brokers and insurers alike recognize in Everest insurance. Further contributing to this strong top line performance were nearly a dozen new underwriting divisions that steadily contributed throughout the year. For the full year, these new divisions, which have been selectively added to the portfolio, contributed nearly 7% in total 2016 gross written premiums. This represents over $100 million of new premium within desired segments and classes of business. A result we are certainly encouraged by, as many of these divisions are not yet a year old. For the quarter, we registered $423 million of gross written premium, an increase of $89 million or 27% over the prior year period. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for our operations. Each division within the North American segment contributed to this growth, with the U.S., Canada and asset and health teams each growing in excess of 20%, along with meaningful contribution from our Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of the underwriting platform. Net written premiums for the year were slightly over $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million or 16% over 2015. As discussed in prior calls, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to a marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. For the quarter, net written premium increased by $50 million or 17% over the prior year quarter, reflecting a strong end to the year and solid momentum from all of our businesses. I do want to make a quick comment as respect to net earned premiums in the quarter. Net earned was down 14% due to the sale of Heartland and the accompanying loss portfolio transfer of this business from the Insurance segment to the Reinsurance segment. Again, excluding Heartland, earned premium was up 14%, which is directionally similar to the trend at net written premium, however, slightly lags due to the significant growth in the portfolio over the past couple of years. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the year, again excluding Heartland, was 116%. As we look back on 2016, there are two notable impacts to our performance. First, was the prior year development of various runoff books of business, principally related to construction defect exposures that contributed 14 points to our loss ratio. Second, the insurance results were impacted by a year of significant cat events across North America, from the Fort McMurray wildfire, a number of Texas hail events, the worst experience over three decades, and finally, Hurricane Matthew. These cat events contributed slightly more than 4 points to our loss ratio in 2016. Taking at the look of the attritional results. The ongoing global insurance operations delivered a 97.9% combined ratio for the year, in line with our expectations, however, elevated from the 93.4% attritional from 2015. Let me breakout some of the factors driving this increase. First, our expense ratio was 29.9% for the year, which again is inclusive of the expenses associated with the build-out of our U.S. and Lloyd platforms and is expected to moderate as we continue our expansion. It should be noted that this expense ratio remains very competitive within the specialty P&C environment. Second, for the full year, the loss and loss expense ratio was 68% compared to 67.1% in 2015. The slight deterioration in the attritional loss ratio for the year is attributable to a number of factors, predominant among these are the adverse impact of various non-cat weather events in \u201816, a slight deterioration in our U.S. auto book, and also some additional pressure on the loss ratio due to the growth in our A&H segment, which carries a higher loss ratio than our P&C products. That stated we are very pleased with the ultimate results of this book. Let me now turn to offers and commentary on the performance of our major insurance portfolios, again starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. Year-over-year, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or nearly $174 million. The momentum within our P&C operations steadily increased throughout the year, again reflective of our significantly enhanced underwriting capabilities and increased market profile. In fact, the fourth quarter represented the strongest performance of the year, registering growth of 21% compared to the comparable quarter in 2015. We experienced meaningful growth in our short tail portfolios and our casualty lines, while specialty grew more moderately. Further, our new business lines launched in the U.S. again contributed nearly 11% to gross written premium in the quarter, a similar figure to last quarter. Our assets in health group also delivered another solid quarter of growth, with a 44% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our efforts to thoughtfully grow our medical stop loss segments within key geographies and business segments proved successful. Our new A&H products also contributed to growth throughout the year and we anticipate this to continue. We have recruited very capable distribution partners and as a result, expect to grow in the senior market segment into 2017. Our Lloyd\u2019s operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $10 million to insurance growth in the quarter, building on the momentum from the third quarter. While still early in its growth cycle, this platform, despite a difficult trading environment, is performing as expected. For 2016, the syndicate has delivered $45 million of premium to the insurance segment, yet only $16 million of earned premium, which again, temporarily impacts the expense ratio. Turning to the operating environment, we see a similar picture to what we experienced throughout much of 2016. With that stated, there is an early emergence of some trends within various lines of business that we are watching closely. I will comment on the dominant lines of business, starting with commercial auto, which continues to be a challenging line of business. Building on the prior three quarters of 2016, we again achieved positive rate across commercial auto lines, with a low double-digit mean increase for the quarter. Over 85% of our book is receiving rate increases. Internet tends to address the frequency and severity trends that we have experienced across the line. That stated, our exposure to commercial auto is somewhat limited and this line of business represents less than 5% of our overall P&C premium. The primary general liability and umbrella markets continued to remain in a tight rate range and are slightly positive for the year. As with the prior quarter and really all year, the professional liability market remains competitive, with rate decreases in the mid single-digit range. Let me spend a minute on the U.S. property market. This market remains very competitive. However, it is our sense that the market is trying to find the bottom on the rates. The elevated frequency of natural catastrophe losses, are acting as a resistance towards continued large decreases. Further, in many occupancies and geographies, we believe the industry has reached the juncture that there is simply no additional rate reduction to be had. Perhaps this is driving the exit of some catastrophe from the space, but we feel there is a large story here that we will keep an eye as we move forward. That stated, we continue to find opportunities to deploy our capacity in a manner that meets our risk and return objectives. Finally, workers\u2019 compensation, our largest line of business by premium size, experienced moderate rate pressure throughout the year in the mid single-digit range, which was largely expected. The favorable underwriting results in the largest work comp market, California, were greeted with steady rate pressure throughout the year. Other markets reacted similarly, although with moderately less rate pressure. So again, the environment trended predictably in \u201816 and we expect much of the same, with the exceptions noted in \u201817. Wrapping up, we are very pleased with the many efforts undertaken in 2016 to position us for future success. We entered 2017 with our leadership team in place, our market profile expanding, a portfolio aligned to our business objectives and a significantly enhanced operating platform. We are confident we will carry our strong top line momentum into 2017 as our many new underwriting initiatives continue to gain scale both within North America and at Lloyd\u2019s. Yes, it remains a challenged operating environment, yet the growing diversity of our platform, again with the top line expanding by over 20% and a firmer handle on our existing portfolio, positions us well for the future. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for Q&A. Beth Farrell : Thank you. That ends our prepared remarks. And we are now open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Elyse Greenspan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. First off, if you could just spend a little bit more time just I know throughout you guys have kind of said that you booked on some of these insurance programs following on the reserve review kind of to give you confidence that you fully addressed this. What are you booking on the construction liability and umbrella programs to and what really changed this year that gives you confidence that 12 months from today we won\u2019t see another charge stemming from some of these runoff programs again? Dom Addesso : This is Dom. Thank you for your question. I think each year, when we have examined these portfolios we have been booking to what I would call the expected results from our actuarial review. And as Craig or someone else could comment on what we are actually booking at to, I don\u2019t know if your question was on loss ratio question, which I don\u2019t really think is relevant, but perhaps this answers it. This year, after undertaking that reserve review, frankly we asked ourselves the same question. We don\u2019t want to be sitting here next year and the year after and taking another charge, of course what drove the higher estimate this year was just an increase of frequency and severity. So hopefully, comeback in this year we selected the upper range of the actuarial estimates. So therefore, we have some confidence that it\u2019s ever an absolute, but of course therefore we have some confidence that they should be behind us. And again, keep in mind this is in the overall context of overall reserve position. And I know it sounded like a broken record, but when we have over 200 different reserve buckets and what we are most concerned about is our overall reserve adequacy at the balance sheet level, because this is clearly a run off business, this not a concern over our existing portfolio. And as evidenced by the reserve release we have this year in addition to other years, you can see that our overall reserve position is solid and in fact was redundant. So that\u2019s what we are most concerned about. But to answer your more specific question, this year we run a little higher in the range to give ourselves the comfort that we can hopefully put this to bet. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then as we think about the margin kind of outlook for your segments, I know within the commentary you guys kind of pointed on the property reinsurance side, slippage probably about 1 point on the combined ratio, how do you see the overall kind of reinsurance margin just in context of tying what you see on the casualty side and also do you \u2013 I guess we should expect some kind of slippage on the combined ratio as you bring the crop business to the reinsurance side, I am just trying to kind of tie all your commentary together to really how you see the margin profile of the reinsurance book in 2017? Dom Addesso : Well, what we have been trying to \u2013 the message we have been trying to make sure everyone understands is that this is a book of business that is not dependent upon property cat business. And of course what you have seen in our margins has been some shift in the attritional and the shift in the attritional still we are getting improvements as a result of new products that we offer. So as John Doucette highlighted in his comments, diversifying it to different product lines and geographies and more importantly product lines, so for example, take credit reinsurance more specifically, mortgage reinsurance, those obviously are carrying much lower loss ratio fits and better combined ratios. So that\u2019s helping to offset some of the declines and actually business that we will let go in the more traditional areas. So we are not necessarily seeing any dramatic change in our attritional going into \u201817. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of just capital return, I knew you guys have always said you look to return less than your earnings, share repurchase, it seems like you guys did not buyback any stock since your last call, so how do you kind of think about I guess just the level of potential capital return for 2017 and any things kind of change on your capital return philosophy over the last three months? Dom Addesso : No, nothing has changed, Elyse. And part of the reason that you didn\u2019t see us do anything last quarter, fourth quarter was the fact, that we had Hurricane Matthew sitting out there and clearly, we had information, more precise information so we become a little reluctant to we buy in shares given the fact that there is major events hanging out there that we are not clear as to what the final outcome will be. So that\u2019s what was driving that, but certainly, there has been no change in our, the way we manage capital. We have a very good long-term track record of doing so that of course gets balanced with what we see as the future business opportunities and the need for capital. And I think we have been, yes, we buy in less than earnings, growing our capital base because we continue to see new opportunities. And that\u2019s \u2013 and we look at this from a very long-term perspective. It\u2019s not just any one year, any one quarter for sure. And we will look out to more than just where are our projections are for book value currently or the current book value, we will look out six months or so to determine where our threshold might be for buying in stock. So essentially, it\u2019s a long way of saying, no change in our philosophy on how we think about capital management. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. First question on reserves, so the 2016 reserve release that was actually the largest in your history. And Dom you mentioned that since you came on Board, you are taking probably more conservative reserves stance, so is that \u2013 there is the question is really, why now certainly big reserve it is, basically because their basic reserve cushion build-out over time, now you have to release it and also how sustainable is that reserve releases going forward? Dom Addesso : Yes. Kai, I mean I have \u2013 for several years now that we have taken a more conservative view of picking the current loss year, in terms of big loss ratio. And that\u2019s frankly driven out of some of uncertainties as do \u2013 in the current market conditions an increased level of uncertainty. But that of course has resulted in some of those older years coming in part of the and positively. And that\u2019s \u2013 it was a good thing. What we tend to do is we handle the casualty and the property. We hold a couple years on casualty studies and we hold less years on the property side. So this release reflects the release from a few years ago from accident years a few years ago. And that will \u2013 that is kind of the process that we go through and we will continue to go down that path. And our \u2013 we still continue to feel that our current reserve position is very strong and adequate. And I can\u2019t sit here and give a prediction as to what the level of reserve releases are not, might be into the future, but as I said, we still remain very confident about our reserves... Kai Pan : So the release, most are related short tail lines in last few years and not sort of some of the potentially long tailed line you have booked since late 2010? Dom Addesso : I am sorry can you repeat that, you broke up a little bit on that question. Kai Pan : Yes. The question was, is that the reserve release is most related to short tail line of business rather than some long-tail line? Dom Addesso : Kai, the process has not changed over the years. As Tom mentioned, what we do is we set a conservative loss pick and then overtime, we are slow to react to any favorable development, but we are very quick to react to any unfavorable development. So what you are seeing right now, most of what was released at this point in time were short-tail business more than 2 years ago. Short tail lines and property lines of business was what the majority of what was released. But there was some casualty in there. And I should also mention, because I know there has been a lot of focus on the insurance adds, we have to make, but it should be noted that we did have some current book of business within the insurance actually did produce redundancy coming through the results in 2016. Net-net, it was a reserve ad, because of the construction defect of umbrella that we highlighted earlier, but it should be pointed out that the current book of business is beginning to produce some releases. Kai Pan : Great. Then second question on the insurance side, the 2016 attritional combined ratio 97.9%, I just wonder, given your gross like projection, you are still growing the business expense ratio probably still a little bit elevated and then there is a business mix shift, some potentially to your high combined ratio, so do you see 2017, 2018, these attritional loss combined ratio going to improve or going to deteriorate before it would becoming improving? Dom Addesso : Our expectation is that it would improve. Again, just to highlight again the things that why it came in at that level. We had some of it was A&H, the growth rate in A&H relative to some of the other lines. We had the non-cat \u2013 heightened level of non-cat events in 2016, which drove that. We had a little bit of auto. Frequency and severity that drove that, which as Jonathan highlighted is lots of rate increase coming on that line of business. And beyond premium catch-up to the written should begin to benefit the results. The expense ratio hasn\u2019t improved yet, because we have actually accelerated some of our business development efforts later in 2016, more so than we anticipated that we would do it, all a good thing, but I would have expected the expense ratio to improve by now, but it hasn\u2019t because of an up level of investment relative to our initial plans. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you so much for all the answers. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sarah DeWitt : Alright. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just following-up on the insurance business, what do you view as the underlying run rate combined ratio in the quarter ex some of these one-time items that you outlined? Dom Addesso : For \u201816, it would have been in the mid-90s. Sarah DeWitt : And is that in line with your target combined ratios in this segment or do you target something lower? Dom Addesso : We will be continuing to target something lower than that. We would expect improvement in that over time. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. And then, separately just want to talk \u2013 get your thoughts on some of the macro issues following the U.S. election, if we got U.S. corporate tax reform, how much would Everest Re benefit and are there any implications from border adjustments for Everest Re? Dom Addesso : I know this is a question that\u2019s hot in everybody\u2019s mind, but it\u2019s a little difficult, not knowing what the final outcome would be to give you any view. But let me just say this. For the last 2 years, we really \u2013 if you take in tax \u2013 lower tax rate plus the cross border tax adjustment, it would have been very minimal impact if any on our overall effective tax rate in the last 2 years. But the bigger question comes in a year where cat losses you are not expected or maybe even higher than expected, that\u2019s the great unknown. But we have got different platforms globally that we could trigger in different ways in which we could really underwrite business. So it\u2019s not \u2013 I can\u2019t give you a clear answer on that other than the fact that we don\u2019t think that it would have any meaningful impact at this point. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yes. So, good morning everyone. One off, we can talk in numbers about bridging the expense to build out the insurance press and Lloyd\u2019s and whatnot and the timeline for what we think that should be in \u201817 and should even be there in \u201818? Dom Addesso : What will be there at all on \u201818? Josh Shanker : The increased expense \u2013 spend associated with the build-out? Dom Addesso : Is that a Lloyd\u2019s question or an overall insurance question? Josh Shanker : It\u2019s the 300 basis point gap between the \u201816 expense ratio and the \u201815 expense ratio and I take \u2013 I understand your reasons behind that, I am wondering how long I should model that to persist? Dom Addesso : I would expect that just to drift down slightly in 2017, and frankly, then level out maybe slightly again in the \u201818, but then level off from there. I don\u2019t believe that we will get back to our historical expense ratio. I mean, you have to remember that we now have the different distribution model. So previously, we were primarily an MJ focused insurance operation, there were more of a direct brokerage operation, which by definition forgetting even the commission element of it, just a general expense ratio element of it requires different types of resources and different systems. So \u2013 it will not get back to maybe what you would have as seen historically from us. Having said that, I think if you could our expectation would be as we even today, we have a much better expense ratio than the industry, we expect that gap doing work to remain. Josh Shanker : Okay. And I am going to go through the 4Q \u201815 trends once again, read about the insurance reserve charge there. I can\u2019t remember exactly where the overlap is between where the charge for this quarter that was charged for 1 year ago. Is there some whack-a-mole sort of situation that while you have taken take you think what\u2019s problematic that you saw in \u201816, can there be other things that come out in \u201817, do we have some limits in place to give us specific comforts or are you surprised 1 year later from the \u201815 charges that you have these charges today? Dom Addesso : We are always surprised because if I said we wanted surprise, then we would have put out a higher number back in 2015. Yes, it is a surprise. And with reserves, you will never know what an increased level of frequency or severity might in fact due to you. But as I mentioned, our other pieces of our portfolio that are active are in fact running at the fast year, produce the redundancy. So we are confident that those reserves are frankly in good order. But again in the context of our overall balance sheet, our reserve position is quite strong. And I think that applies to the various segments as well even though I know I keep emphasizing the overall balance sheet, which is important and worth emphasizing. We do go through each of our segments to make sure that we have got positive reserve or strong reserve position in each of those segments. Josh Shanker : And then finally, I guess in terms of the Heartland premium coming into the reinsurance segment, given that you sort of explained the economics of Heartland as insurance contract, how different are the economics of it as a reinsurance contract? Dom Addesso : John, you answer that. John? John Doucette : Good morning, this is John. So a couple of things, the strategic relationship we entered as a reinsurance opportunity with the buyer of Heartland is it has a couple of advantages for us. First of all, it runs, we believe to a meaningful improvement in expenses and because of just economies of scale that we were unable to achieve on our own book, given the size of the premium. And then secondly, we also had struggled in our insurance book to develop a broad, diversified portfolio. And so individual localized weather events were causing more problems for us and caused more volatility in the book as an insurance play. What we are going to get is the benefit of a much, much larger book, a share of that book on a reinsurance quota share basis. So we think we are going to run to a better combined ratio, meaningfully and we think there is going to be less volatility in the results. Josh Shanker : One of your competitors in the crop business has said this is 89%, 90% combined ratio business, do you think that\u2019s adequate or fair? Dom Addesso : I don\u2019t know specifically, what you are talking about and if you are talking about it as an insurance player or as a reinsurance play, we would think as a reinsurance play, it\u2019s low-90s. Josh Shanker : Okay, that\u2019s excellent. Thank you for the color. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Josh. John Doucette : Thank you, Josh. Operator : And we will take our final question from Quentin McMillan with KBW. Please go ahead. Quentin McMillan : Hi. Thanks very much guys. I just wanted to tie together something that you have historically said versus what we saw today, so Dom, you mentioned that 2016 is a heightened year of cat loss activity at a little over $300 million in cat losses on a net basis and then I think Craig mentioned $420 million on a gross basis when we net out prior year cat losses, but that $300 million number, it\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s a little under 6 points on the cat loss ratio and historically you guys have said that you expect about 10 points of cat losses in a normal year, so can you help to sort of tie those thoughts together of this being a heightened loss year, yet you were running much better than what that cat loss would indicate? Dom Addesso : I am actually going to ask \u2013 I am going to make a few comments and then ask John to set the comment on it as well, but keep in mind that the asset was a heightened year, many of the losses though were low in the attachment point, a lot of the losses were assumed by primary. And what is consistent with what you have said is through the last couple of years given risk-adjusted pricing in order to maintain our level of risk-adjusted pricing we have moved attachment point, gotten off in certain things that we didn\u2019t like the pricing on and we believe that, that\u2019s had an impact on our result relative to what the overall level of tax were in the industry. So, I think that\u2019s just a general comment and maybe John Doucette might have something to add to that. John Doucette : Yes, Quentin, I think a couple of things. The reinsurance strategy, we continue to look to how we can improve the book and deploy and take cat risk better and deploy and build a better and better portfolio and taking into account market conditions but also the buying habits of local companies, regional companies and global clients. So to the extent that we \u2013 the global clients \u2013 take the global clients, to the extent that they are looking to do more across the board and across multiple lines of business at multiple territories with companies like Everest, we are deploying more cat capacity to them. And that usually means given the retentions that they want to take in order to control the pricing of the reinsurance program, they typically are protecting against the real major losses, very big earthquakes, very big hurricanes, etcetera. And so that wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact us as much in a year like this, with the exception of the Canadian wildfires and Hurricane Matthew. And then we also, as Dom said, we are trying to shift our book and we have been moving not in every case, but generally, we have been moving up the tower. That also means it takes larger losses to affect us. But then I would also highlight the different hedges that we have in place, including Mt. Logan. And Mt. Logan continues to be a strategic platform for Everest and we saw some benefits from that in 2016, with recoveries that we saw from both Matthew and Fort McMurray wildfire losses in Canada as well as some other smaller losses around the group. So, we think that, that helps mitigate some of the cat loss activity that Everest faces on its inward book of business through the various hedges that we have in place as well. Quentin McMillan : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just on a capital-related question, you guys paid out about 60% in the form of dividends and share repurchases and I know you don\u2019t have a specific capital plan that you are going to guide us to. But how much of the remaining 40% of the operating earnings that you produced was used to fund the strong growth in the insurance segment this year on Jonathan\u2019s side? Dom Addesso : I am going to answer that as really an overall question as opposed to specifically to insurance. Overall, we still have about the same level of what we call excess capital. And so all of the metrics that we used to measure what our economic capital needs to be remain about the same. So that capital growth basically is supporting all of the lines of business both insurance and reinsurance remembering that we are doing some different things on the reinsurance side that consumed different levels of capital. Quentin McMillan : Okay, very hopeful. And then sorry to sneak out last in, in terms of the investment portfolio. Obviously, there is a big move and you guys did have a mark-to-market loss as everybody did unrealized loss as everybody did in the quarter. But the yield in the portfolio looked like it ticked up a little bit. Did you guys shift anything around? Can you just talk about what the new money yield is versus where they, I believe Craig said that portfolio pre-tax yield currently is 2.8% so maybe versus that currently? Craig Howie : This is Craig. Quentin, we did not make much of a shift. What we did do was shift it a little bit as I mentioned last quarter within the alternative capital or our alternative investment buckets. But overall the portfolio remains very stable, very high credit quality investment grade volumes. It makes up the majority of the portfolio. And then we have alternative investments. The new money rate that you are suggesting is about the same, about 2.8% compared to what the current yield is, at 2.8% as well. Dom Addesso : And the returns, the yield that you are referencing essentially what happened in the fourth quarter, it all depends on timing of the limited partnership and alternative investment income and that can get a little lumpy. So, we are pleased that frankly, year-over-year investment income was flat. We think that was a pretty terrific outcome. Quentin McMillan : Perfect. Thanks very much guys. Dom Addesso : We are going to expand a little bit, because I know we are running over. But perhaps, we\u2019ve got a little worry in our opening remarks. So we will extend beyond our usual hour and if there is one or two more questions and perhaps we can entertain, I am sure you won\u2019t mind. Operator : Yes. We will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Gelb : Thank you. I was hoping you could comment on the M&A environment broadly within insurance and reinsurance and any update on Everest view on consolidation? Thanks. Dom Addesso : Well, I still think the same factors are at play, scale being one of the more relevant factors, continues to put pressure on many of our competitors who seek partners and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. And I think that will continue to be the trend going forward, scale and efficiency. For us, as you know, our strategy remains the same. We are not a big fan of putting a ton of good role in the books. And frankly, acquisitions are difficult to \u2013 in our view, others have certainly \u2013 could have a different business model, but in our view, acquisitions are difficult to assimilate and with it comes perhaps elements of the portfolio that you don\u2019t wish to be engaged in. It will require some remediation. And we think it\u2019s a lot cleaner to get the talent that we think we can secure the good talent and build out the portfolio in the manner and shape that we feel is most desirable. So that\u2019s kind of our continued strategy. If there are things that we don\u2019t think we can build out on our own successfully meaning elements of the different lines of business, very, very focused areas, we have continued to look at things, but I am not giving it a highlight that would be \u2013 you would see something in that regard, but I wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely. Jay Gelb : Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Jay. Operator : And we will go take our final question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks for putting me in. Just two questions here for you. First, Dom, John, do you have any exposure to changes \u2013 potential changes in the [indiscernible] rate table? Dom Addesso : Brian, I think you said the [indiscernible] rate table\u2026 Brian Meredith : Yes. Dom Addesso : You broke up a little bit, yes. So we write business all over the world. We write a very little bit of motor business in the context of our overall over $4 billion of premium. It\u2019s not material to us. So the short answer to your question is, it\u2019s what we watch that. We look at the rates. We are probably a little less \u2013 we are probably a little more pessimistic on that over the last couple of years, so we have not deployed that much capital in that respect of area. So, we do not think its material to us. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. And last question, John, I was intrigued by your comment that you said, that you are exploring new structures that will strengthen kind of core client relationships well into the future. Are you referring to new multiyear kind of reinsurance agreements? Can you give us some examples of what you are talking about? John Doucette : So we have \u2013 it really applies to a lot of different things. It applies to strategic relationships that we are trying to dealt with some of our core clients. We have added some of those in 2016. We have \u2013 some of are doing half a dozen and a dozen of these kind of core strategic relationships. We are looking to expand that and continue to deploy that where we really become a strategic partner to the clients and not just a large reinsurer to them. And that\u2019s worked out very well for us. We continue to deploy and really holistically deploy capacity with the global clients and we see that as the big opportunity for us in the future as they want to trade more with companies like Everest and less with others, either because of too much concentration with some of the big directs or they want to narrow their reinsurance panel. We are spending more time really strategizing about how we, as one of the very largest broker market reinsurers, how we can grow more with the brokers in the reinsurance area and we think that\u2019s something that won\u2019t be to the benefit of both of us and we expect to continue to make headway in that in different products that they have different initiatives and different strategies with that going forward. And then frankly, just a lot of these new alternatives really building out what we called the nontraditional space for this product, new products, new distribution, new clients and we are making good headway there, both hiring people, developing resources internally and have had recently some few nice wins in that space. And we look to continue to deploy that going forward. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks for the answer. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Brian and thanks to all for participating in this morning\u2019s call. Apologies for going a little longer, but we had the questions in queue. We obviously were pleased with our performance this past year. And we recognized as to you that it\u2019s very challenging market, but we are still quite confident that we can outperform on a relative basis and an absolute basis. My colleagues here this morning kind of outlined some of the new things we are doing and I have highlighted our balance sheet strength, the reserve position, which certainly bodes well for the future. So, we are very confident that we can continue to perform well. And that\u2019s not without taking an increased level of risk. It\u2019s continuing to do what we do. It\u2019s underwrite through the different parts of the cycle and diversifying, diversifying into new products and new areas and continue to expand our franchise, in particular, expand the insurance franchise, which we think is one of the ways forward as well as product diversification on the reinsurance side. So thank you very much for your interest and your participation this morning. We look forward to seeing you probably over the next several weeks. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Beth, please go ahead. Beth Farrell : Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, our President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, our President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dom Addesso : Thanks, Beth. Good morning to all, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call, and we have a positive report for you today. Before we dive into the quarterly results, I would like to touch briefly on the characteristics that have helped the Everest Re Group deliver above average returns. Certainly our size and scope are important differentiators, but more critical to our success is the entrepreneurial and decisive culture that permeates our organization. We are not satisfied with the status quo, but instead, continually seek to expand our horizons for new opportunities as well as increase our penetration to existing clients. Examples of this would be our expansion into credit opportunities in both our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses. And just this quarter, we participated on the new National Flood Reinsurance Program which represents new business to the market. As governments seek to privatize certain markets, we could see similar additional opportunity. So why is this important? These new market segments allow us to continue to diversify our portfolio away from the more competitive markets and sustain underwriting profitability. This, and a constant focus on expenses, and our expanding use of capital market tools explains why we continue to outperform the market. This now leads me to our discussion on results, which again were quite positive for the quarter. Operating income increased 17% in the quarter to $260 million, giving rise to $6.29 in earnings per share, and a 13% operating ROE for the quarter. The increase in earnings is a result of an increase in both the underwriting and investment income. Furthermore, the underwriting result improved in both the Reinsurance and Insurance division. While our reinsurance combined ratio was up slightly over the prior year, due to a relatively minor increase in cash, the increase in earned premium propelled us to a higher underwriting result. Increase in earned premium is a continuing result of broadening our reinsurance product set over the last several quarters into crop, mortgage, and other credit-related opportunity. Entering into credit-related business has contributed to the almost one-point improvement in quarter's attritional combined ratio, 80%. John Doucette will discuss this in greater detail in his Reinsurance operations. The Insurance segment results improved year-over-year to an underwriting gain position. This was in part a result of the drag in the prior year from the crop operation that we sold late last year. Excluding the Heartland crop business, the attritional combined ratio of 98.1 for the quarter reflects a stable loss ratio, but an uptick in the commission and operating expense ratio. The commission ratio was up on a changing business mix, while operating expenses are trending as planned. We continue to build out the North America and European platforms, and have had great success with gross premiums written up 21% in the quarter excluding crop. Expenses are still outpacing earned premium thereby putting pressure on the expense ratio. But we would expect this to stabilize as the operation matures. However, despite this more elevated expense ratio, you will find that by comparison we are still quite efficient relative to the market. We are pleased with what the team has accomplished in a relatively short timeframe, which was aided in part by the market dislocation created by a few large players. In fact, given the opportunities presented by this market turmoil, we accelerated our investment in the operation. You will hear more details on all this later in Jon Zaffino's operations report. Another strong spot this quarter was investment income, which increased approximately $20 million. Our alternative portfolio accounted for some of that improvement, along with a higher asset base. Our strategy here is not much different than the fundamentals principles we use in our total business, conservative yet look for differentiated opportunities that provide good margins relative to risk. As a result, our overall portfolio has a beta of less than one, but yet our returns have been in the upper quartile relative to our peer group. Overall, we continue our optimism in our ability to not only outperform, but also provide above-market returns through the cycle. I maintain that optimism because of, as I referenced earlier, the well-diversified platform we have built, but perhaps more importantly because of our adaptability to market changes and opportunities. That comes from a corporate culture that embraces new opportunities, and that has the skilled talent to execute. You will hear more about our newest initiatives from my colleagues and how we continue to build our franchise for the future. Thank you and I look forward to your questions later on. Now to Craig, for the financial report. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $172 million for the first quarter of 2016. The 2017 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of over 14%. Net income included $32 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $51 million of capital losses in the first quarter of last year. 2017 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $260 million compared to $223 million in 2016. The overall underlying gain for the group was $183 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $171 million in the same period last year all segments reported underwriting gains for the quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, Everest saw $20 million of current year catastrophe losses related to Cyclone Debbie in Australia compared to $10 million of catastrophe losses during the first quarter of 2016. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 84.5% down from 85.3% in the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to a lower commission ratio in 2017. Our overall expense ratio of 5.8% was down slightly from the first quarter of 2016. Our reported combined ratio of 86% was flat compared to the first quarter last year. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $122 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 19% above last year; this result was primarily driven by an increase of limited partnership income which was up $17 million from the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to the turnaround in energy related investments compared to last year. Pre-tax year on the overall portfolio was 2.8% with the duration of just over three years. Foreign exchanges reported another income, for the first quarter of 2017 foreign exchange losses were $4 million similar to the first quarter of 2016. Other income also included $2 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re compared to $3 million of income in the first quarter of last year. On income taxes, the 9% effective tax rate on operating income was on the low end of our expected range for the year. First quarter of 2017 tax rate is slightly lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year of 2016 due to a $5 million tax benefit for a size B tax accounting change related to share based compensation. Previously these tax benefits were book through additional paid in capital in the balance sheet. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes plan to Catastrophe losses for the rest of the year should catastrophe was coming lower than this estimate it would be expected that the tax rate would go up. Stable cash flows continues with operating cash flows of $382 million for the quarter compared with $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter up $272 million from year end 2016. This is after taking into account the capital return for $51 million of dividends period in the first quarter of 2017. Capital position remains very strong and continues to grow. Thank you and now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance operation. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with a $178 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. Our earnings reflect the continued strength of our reinsurance franchise the stain by product and geographic diversification, underwriting discipline and ultimately relevance to our client. Everest long standing global presence high ratings and nimble execution underpin our outperformance through this part of the underwriting cycle. Before discussing renewals, here's some color on the first quarter results. Total gross written premium for the first quarter was $1.2 billion an increase of 19% compared to Q1, 2016. There were a combination of growth on existing business and new business opportunities. This included $53 million of crop premium on the new quarter share arrangement done in conjunction with the sale of Heartland as well as new structured reinsurance business. The growth in these profitable, diversifying, and strategic line, fortifies our competitive strength in an otherwise difficult market. Additionally, these customized transactions require a differentiating breath and skill from a sizeable and strong partner. Our agility in executing these bespoke transactions is highly valued by our clients, and accomplished to attracting best-in-class underwriting actuarial and analytical talent and providing them appropriate resources within a lean and responsive organization conducive to creative solution. The Q1 loss ratio increased from 55.6% to 53.2% in Q1 2016, driven in part by an increase in the cat loss ratio with losses in Cyclone Debbie impacting the quarter. In addition, the quarter experienced lower favorable prior year loss development and an uptick in the current year attritional loss ratio. The shift in the composition of our book to the higher expected loss ratio on a new crop business accounted for the slight increase in our attritional loss ratio. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, Q1 2017 gross written premium was up 8% to $579 million. Growth was driven by crop and credit related reinsurance writing, offset by a 9% decrease in property line as we walked away from underpriced pro rata business. The Q1 combined ratio for the U.S. reinsurance segment was up 3.1 point, affected by the new crop writing with a higher attritional loss ratio and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This was partially offset by a lower commission ratio. Although the crop writing produced higher combined ratios, they consumed relatively little capital. Our international reinsurance segment, premium was $266 million, up 13% for the quarter and up 8% on a constant dollar basis. We saw growth across most of our territories : Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Singapore, and Canada. Increased property pro rata business and some higher cat XOL business, particularly in loss-affected region coupled with our growth in our worldwide facultative operation provided for this growth; the combined ratio for this segment improved by 1.1 point to 86.6% despite higher cat losses and lower level of reserve release. This was due to an almost 6 point improvement in the attritional loss ratio, driven by better experience in certain region and a lower mix of casualty pro rata business. Our Bermuda segment written premium increased 57% to $321 million, about 61% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was largely from new business including new credit opportunities and account true ups on financial line treaty. In addition, premium growth also came from both London and Europe, including motor quota shares and new strategic reinsurance deals with large core global client. The combined ratio improved to 83.5% with a lower current year attritional loss ratio, no prior year reserve development, and a lower expense ratio. Moving on to the 4/1 renewals; Everest is well positioned in a market that appears to be stabilizing. Rate pressures continue but are showing signs of moderating, as ample capacity is partially offset by increase in demand in some zones. In the Asia-Pacific market, renewal rate in loss-affected area such as New Zealand were up an average of 5% with rates in a range of flat to down 10% in other areas. Japanese renewal decreases were more moderate at flat to down 5%. In the U.S. property markets, excessive loss rates were flat to down 5% with indications that some early 6/1 renewals will be flat. We are expecting incremental Florida demand fostering some market stability, but this could be somewhat offset by decreased purchasing by citizen. As Dom mentioned, we did participate on the new National Flood Program that came to the market and we are exploring other potential opportunities around flood coverage. In our casualty book, reinsurance rates, terms and conditions are stable but reductions on underlying business continue, put pressure on overall economic. Nevertheless, we were able to reallocate our capital to more favorable opportunities, and we see some improvement in certain facultative lines. Internationally, some of the recent currency movements have allowed foreign-based competitors to report accounting gains, softening the otherwise REIT profitability across major classes and delaying market stabilization. However, rate decreases were smaller than in prior renewal. In the U.K, augment rate change which has affected the UK model market has caused the market disruption with treaties being extended as insurers reassess their strategy. Large rate increases and program restructurings have been the norm on affected motor programs. Throughout the world, our clients demand multi-faceted solutions commensurate with their expanding scope, complex capital requirements and unique demand. Our clients clearly want to trade with reinsurers like Everest that offers scale, expertise, and a sustainable franchise. We just completed our latest cap fund transaction with the issuance of $1.25 billion of Kilimanjaro 2 catastrophe bond. That brings our total catastrophe bond capacity to $2.8 billion, which in conjunction with Mt. Logan and our balance sheet elevates every total capacity and capital across those rated and unrated balance sheets to almost $13 billion. This place is among the very largest reinsurers in the industry making us even more relevant to our clients and brokers. Overall, Everest Reinsurance operations remain well-positioned and diversified by product, distribution, geography, client, and capital, giving us numerous levers to control our market efficiency and effectiveness. We continually enhance our strategic focus to succeed in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jon Zaffino : Thank you, John, and good morning. The Everest Global Insurance operations performed well and in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Many strategic actions we have taken will establish a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization by becoming increasing evident in our results; they consistently expand in top line across a balance portfolio, a testament to the relevant we are achieving among our insurance and brokers. We continue applying opportunities to profitably expand our business across our global platform despite a challenging market environment. As a result, Everest Insurance is firmly positioned in the market landscape as a specialty provider offering a live breadth of product solutions in lines of business that we expect to outperform over the long-term. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will be discussing our comparative results, excluding this business. For the first quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations registered $434 million in gross written premium, an increase of $75 million or 21% over first quarter of 2016. Another outstanding result and consistent with the growth rate we saw in 4Q 2016; this represents the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance Operation, each division within the North American segment contributed to this with notable strong performances from our Canadian and accident and health platforms. Each of which grew in excess of 30%. A further note, roughly 18% of our production in the quarter was derived from our recent new business launches and from our Lloyd's operation, which as you will recall has entered only second year of account. We remain encouraged by this balanced contribution across the diversity of our growing underwriting platform. Net written premiums for the quarter were $346 million, an increase of $37 million or 12% over 2016. As we've shared in the past, net written premium growth slightly lags gross written premium growth due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support our many new underwriting divisions. There were notable transactions in the quarter particularly within our teenage group that also contributed to a slightly lower net to gross ratio. We expect this to normalize throughout the year. Net earned premium in the quarter increased by more in line with our gross written premium on a percentage basis producing $323 million, which represents 17% growth from the first quarter of 2016. Turning to the combined ratio, the GAAP combined ratio for the first quarter was 98.4%. While we are pleased to produce and underwriting profit with more than 5 million in the segment, we expect to show continued improvement as earned from new develops in future quarters. The overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the Global Insurance Operations remained essentially flat year-over-year registering a 68.25 in the first quarter of 2017 were 68.1% in the first quarter of 2016. On a nutritional basis, these ratios improved 67.8% and our flat period-over-period. Let me offer a couple of additional comments to further amplify our performance. First, for the 1Q '16 and 1Q '17 had unprecedented levels of connectivity in the U.S. with 12 PCS events declared in first quarter of this year. Despite this our book is performing well, our conservative loss estimates for our US property lines coupled with a series of deliberate underwriting actions taken over the past several quarters are largely mitigated the impact of these events to us. Second as earned premium comes in on several of our new business launches referenced earlier, which have historically generated better combine ratios, we expect the shipping portfolio mix will result in improved overall profitability. Again the bottom-line, we expect improvement in the underlying loss ratios as we move through the year. Our expense ratio in the first quarter was 30.3% up when compared to 28.2% in the first quarter of 2016 were essentially in line with the full year 2016 results up 29.9%. The changed first quarter of 2016 represents roughly a one point increase in our commission in premium tax expenses and a one point increase in our operating expenses. There remained moderate pressure on our expense ratio due to the continued organic build of our operation along with the impact from the lag of earned premium. We anticipate the expense ratio to moderate and stabilize as we continue on our growth path. As Dom mentioned an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment. I'll now turn to the performance of our major insurance portfolios starting with the North America P&C book which is our largest business. In the first quarter, the core P&C portfolio grew 15% or $353 million over the prior year period. They continue to gain momentum across the breadth of our specialty P&C operations headlining the quarter were a continued steady growth from our new business initiatives, which represented 17% of our total premium production in the quarter; the highest level we have experienced today. The continued addition of outstanding talents supports our strategy across underwriting claims technology, actuarial and several support areas. And the announcement of a portfolio transaction, we consummated to effectively acquire renewal rates to a direct and facultative book of property business. This book of business closely aligned with our own appetite newly into our property expansion strategy, and we are pleased to welcome several new talents and underwriters to the Everest family. Our assets in health group also delivered an excellent quarter of growth, with a 38% increase over the prior year comparable quarter. Our continued efforts to thoughtfully diversify and grow our product lines, including medical stop loss continue to prove successful. Notably in the quarter, several of our new A&H products, particularly our sports visibility offering also contributed meaningfully to growth. We expect we will continue to find opportunities across the balance book of A&H business as the year progresses. Our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The Syndicate contributed $21 million to the insurance growth in the quarter, nearly double the contribution from 4Q 2016. All lines of business ranging from our property through our professional indemnity books experienced growth despite a challenging rate environment. We remain deliberate in our growth pursuits and are finding opportunities for continued expansion. Turning to the operating environment, the first quarter represented a predictably mixed picture from a rate perspective. The overall level of rate change varies meaningfully my major line of business. As a general statement across the entirety of the North American portfolio, I would say that rate pressures are somewhat mitigating. In fact, we have many lines of business that are gaining rate across our book. Let's take a look at this my major line of business. Commercial Auto again headlined our rate change results in the first quarter, as it has in several prior quarters. We continue to achieve high single to low double-digit rate changes for this line of business. Again, our exposure to this line is limited as it continues to represent less than 5% of our overall writings. Also, as in prior quarters, the primarily general liability and umbrella markets continue to remain in the tight range and are basically flat year-over-year. The professional liability markets remain competitive with continued rate pressures in the mid single-digit range across various lines. We continue to take a conservative posture in this market. Of particular interest to us is the broader attention to rate in terms being exhibited in the U.S. property market, while capacity remains plentiful, the market continues to find the bottom. Directional price changes month-by-month are recognizing this reality. 12 PCS convective storm cat events in the first quarter, a record for insured losses, on top of last year's prior record quarter should add momentum to this price action. As we noted last quarter, we feel there is a larger positive story emerging that will allow us to selectively expand our portfolio. Finally, workers' compensation, our largest line of business, continued to experience moderate rate pressure in the low to mid single-digit range on the back of continued favorable underwriting results. While not an unexpected result, there is still an opportunity to consider new business in certain select territories as we closely monitor the many trends across this line. So, while the rate environment is trending predictably line by line, the overall rate picture is improving across the entirety of our portfolio. In conclusion, we are pleased with our start to the year. Our team continues to execute very well against the major strategic objectives within our organic growth plan. As a result, our market brand and capabilities continue to grow. The Annual RIMS Conference, which is underway as we speak, is reaffirming our belief in the Everest insurance value proposition. Based on the client interaction and meeting schedules of our colleagues in attendance, it is clear we are being embraced by a growing range of brokers and insurers alike. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to Beth for q-and-a. Beth Farrell : Thank you, Jon. That ends our prepared remarks. I'd like to open up for the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. My first question, I was hoping just to get a little bit more color. You guys saw exceptional growth in your reinsurance business to start the year. I know lots of moving parts with the crop, some growth in credit, and then also in other geographies outside of the U.S., but when you kind of blend your market outlook together, how do you really see the growth trajectory over the remaining three quarters. And just a question in relation to the Q1, is any of the premium growth that you saw kind of one-time in nature or are there any multi-year covers included within the strong growth you saw in the first quarter? John Doucette : Good morning, Elyse. It's John, and thanks for the question. So, I think there were some one-off parts to the growth in the reinsurance operation. As we mentioned, there were some true ups, but there is also a combination of growth in the mortgage and credit lines. Some of those are new deals, and some of those are multi-year deals where we're continuing to get premium from prior quarters. So we would think a normalized growth rate would be high single-digit. Elyse Greenspan : And do you think that high single-digit is something that's sustainable over the balance of 2017 based on how you see the market right now? John Doucette : We do. We do think that -- I mean, there's a lot of gives and takes in that, but we continue to see new opportunities. There's places where we're coming off business that we don't think is attractive, but at the same time we continue to find new opportunities, both -- we talked about the motor quota shares in Europe tied to Solvency II. Also, in the U.K. motor market there's opportunities. But then also in the mortgage and the credit and one-off structured deals that we have in the pipeline now. Dom Addesso : And this is Dom. I mean, it's also highly dependant upon June 1. So while we have had lots of new opportunities and growth in new areas, new types of products that we're offering, in particular credit, but depending on what happens with rates is just one; it's still yet to be determined. So hard to predict some sustainability to our growth rate, and we don't yet know what June 1 will be offering us. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. You guys [indiscernible] loss, did you guys have any adverse development associated with the change in the rate there? Dom Addesso : The [indiscernible] loss, the prior period event, and that was covered in our prior year-end reserve position. And it's a kind of thing that though not specifically known at prior years, the kind of thing our reserve analysis contemplates for things that can go wrong. So it's completely covered in that reserve position. We estimate that with the current discount rate that they're applying up to $30 million was the impact. Elyse Greenspan : And that's included in how your reserves are set today? Dom Addesso : Yes, absolutely. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of capital return, there was no share repurchase in the quarter. I know we also saw a slowdown at the end of 2016. When you guys are thinking through capital return right now, how do you kind of balance just the growth opportunities that you're seeing in reinsurance as well as insurance? And then just also where your staff is obviously trading at a higher valuation, so can you just update us on your thought process for the first quarter, as well as when you think about capital return over the balance of 2017. Dom Addesso : Sometimes I feel like a broken record on this one. As you know, we do not give any predictions as to what we will be doing in terms of share repurchases. But relative to the first quarter how we were thinking about it was that, as you did see, we had significant growth. So we remained a little bit more cautious on capital return, to the point of not buying in any shares. This coupled with the fact that we had a number of cat events that were potentially swirling out, surround [ph] out there. So that was part of our deliberations. And then the third, I think that you made reference to of course, was our rise in stock price. While in and of itself and by itself not a sole determinant, but along with the other factors led us to not be purchasing any shares back in the first question. And none of that means that we won't be back into the market throughout the year. But again, it has to be balanced up against events are the occurring in the marketplace as well as our premium growth trajectory. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks so much, and congrats on a great start to the year. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Elyse. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. And so first question on the insurance side. What do you think are your competitive advantages that you can grow in this -- like a more changing market condition, at the same time improving your core or your combined ratio towards your 95%, like maybe long-term target? How soon do you think you can get there? Jon Zaffino : Good morning, Kai, this is Jon. I think our competitive position in the market is quite strong. And think sits on the backs of we are obviously trading with the benefit of a significant balance sheet from the Everest Group, which credentials exceedingly well in a number of our chosen markets. We have been able to amass what we feel is very distinguished talent, taking advantage of the dislocation in the market over the past couple of years. And remember, our insurance platform has been around for a while, so we have a pretty good reach in terms of different market segments, different product lines, et cetera. So as we refined our strategy and focused on the areas that we thought would contribute more to our bottom line and also help us increase our relevance with clients by providing solutions. We're now starting to see the momentum of all those actions take hold. So that's been very encouraging. As for why we feel that's going to produce better results, there's a lot of changes. So to borrow John's comment earlier, there's a lot of ins and outs here, lot of different mix scenarios coming in. Our new businesses tend to trend at a lower ELR, expected loss ratios, than we've had in the past. So as those gain more scale, as we exit certain lines, such as our crop operation which is better handled in our reinsurance side, as we deemphasize a couple of other areas that had higher loss ratios, we expect that combination and mix to produce better performance that we've seen historically. Dom Addesso : And I think in part, Kai, to answer that, the -- a little bit of market disruption along with, as Jonathan pointed out, the significant capital base that is attractive to our clients and brokers, but that market disruption again allowed us to get very capable people, but also as other competitors were reevaluating their strategies, that enabled us to grow certain segments faster than we might otherwise would've been able to do. Kai Pan : And do you see yourself can get down to the mid-90's combined ratio next couple of years? Dom Addesso : Well, one interesting point that we shouldn't gloss over is that the first quarter, while none of the events -- the weather events, catastrophes if you will, PCI events that Jonathan referenced, while none of them reached our threshold for declaring them to be cats, nonetheless, we had $15 million of weather losses in the first quarter of the insurance operations, which amounts to four-and-a-half points in the combined ratio for the insurance results. So as you could see, we're pretty much already where you're referencing. Kai Pan : Okay, that's great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. So I just wonder, is there any seasonality because now you have the crop reinsurance in the U.S. reinsurance book. That would impact your second quarter and third quarter year-over-year comparison in term of the core combined ratio. John Doucette : Hi, Kai, it's John. There isn't that much seasonality. And crop, while it's a new piece given the move from the insurance to the reinsurance, in the grand scheme of things it's relatively small across the overall global portfolio for the reinsurance operations. So I would say, no, there's not really much seasonality. Kai Pan : So the fourth quarter and the first quarter results should be a good indication for the coming two quarters? Dom Addesso : You're talking in terms of loss ratio? Kai Pan : Yes, just the overall, the core combined ratio, attritional combined ratio, because there are probably different mix between loss and, like, commission expenses. Dom Addesso : Yes, that doesn't move around all that much because from quarter to quarter based on our pegged loss ratios. Obviously, when we get to the fourth quarter we have our reserve here, and reserve review which could impact the attritional in that quarter. I don't know that you'd refer to that as a seasonality, but our earned premium is earned ratably through the year, and we book a consistent estimated loss ratio absent any [indiscernible] type events. Kai Pan : Great. Just quick number clarification, there it's $30 million Ogden [ph] rate impact, is that already including in this quarter reserve development, or in the fourth quarter one? You said year-end [technical difficulty] reserve\u2026 Dom Addesso : What I was referencing was that the impact of Ogden in terms of a dollar amount wasn't made known of course until the first quarter. But what I was referencing was that we consider that to be a prior-year event which was more than covered in our year-end reserve review. While not specifically of course an item in the year-end reserve review just like many other discrete events that occur many quarters or years later frankly when you look at reserves pointing this is that our reserve review contemplates the fact that things can go wrong, things can happen, but you cannot specifically identify what they might be. So, our reserve review has a certain amount of conservatism built into it, or I would describe as a fact that the point of the reserve review as an unknown event and we have been in situation it was prior year event for us and well within the balance of being covered in our year-end reserve review contemplations. Kai Pan : It's great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Kai. Operator : We will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning. In the Reinsurance segment, I was surprised with the underlying combined ratio improved year-over-year in what is still competitive market, can you talk about how you're achieving this and how sustainable is that going forward? Dom Addesso : The simple answer is, Sarah, is just the changing mix, so as for example as mortgage and other credit related opportunities as that premium begins to flow through the books that carriers a lower loss ratio, combined ratio than which you would think about as the more traditional lines. That's frankly the simplest example of explanation. We will also have quota share coming into the reinsurance book, which also helps maintain that ratio. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. And then just a couple of numbers questions, how much did the crop Reinsurance transaction contribute to the top line and then how much is your mortgage and credit business? Dom Addesso : Crop was about $50 million. Craig Howie : Yes, $53 million in the first quarter. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. And how big is the mortgage and credit business? Craig Howie : And the total mortgage of gross written premiums, it's about $150 million to $200 million. Sarah DeWitt : Annually? Craig Howie : In the quarter. Dom Addesso : Sorry could you say that again? Sarah DeWitt : That's an annual number or in the quarter? Dom Addesso : Yes, that's annual. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thanks and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the, the midyear Florida renewals where I believe you said hoping for flat rates I think it's pretty well understood that citizens insurance capacities can be down midyear in terms of demand for reinsurance protection but I just wanted understand if I have you correctly are you saying demand from other primary writers in Florida is going to enough to offset that. Dom Addesso : Well citizen is down because private market as soon much of that exposure so capacity will be soft from private market. Jay Gelb : Okay, is there any influence do you think it midyear as a result of Matthew. Craig Howie : We hope we think that there could be some influence but that all dependence on how much capital has been go into the market so look, based on the returns that the industry is producing on overall capital. We do you think it, it suggest that that rate should be in flat but there's no way for us to know what that might be right now. John Doucette : This is John. There's also other contributing factors with AOB issue that's out there and that impacted people in 2016 including the capital position. The assignment of benefits, so the assignment of benefits issue that happened in that has been happening that has resulted in an increase in the attritional loss ratio for many of the Florida teams and so some of them had to go get more capital or in the process of getting more capital or raising more capital and as reinsurance is the form of capital. And so a lot of them are potentially looking to increase their buys whether it comes, whether that's on a quota share or on an excess loss basis, as well as some of the larger Florida seasons have also been diversifying outside the state, so as they've been growing, they have natural exposure growth for their overall books of business, their reinsurance demands to protect that book have also been increasing and we would see that to directionally to continue. Jay Gelb : That is helpful, thanks very much. And then my separate question, Dom, in this year's annual shareholder letter, you talked about the decision to build in the Insurance segment as opposed to buy I'm kind of glad you brought that up in the letter hopefully it's pretty good jumping off point just to touch on it in a bit more detail. Dom Addesso : That was specific question. Jay Gelb : Yes, just in terms of -- in terms of that decision and kind of where you see the insurance segment going forward? Dom Addesso : We have had this view for long time and it's not because we haven't considered opportunities that are out there and our view was based on the fact that integration since we had an existing operation as contrasted with not having one at all, we felt it was easier for us to grow our existing franchise. In the phase of acquisitions are tough because the integration issues are challenged in addition you're not quite sure talent that you're getting, the legacy issues that you might be attaining, there is a whole different face to the market in terms of how a particular company might be presenting itself to the distribution partners, they will have ability to kind of build our message, or culture or products or appetite all those things from the ground up is more attractive to us. And then, of course, it coupled with many of these acquisitions as you know are occurring at tremendous multiples creating lot of goodwill but that aside we are potentially buying businesses that have mid-single digit ROEs that is not and I'm paying a premium for that, that's not all that attractive. And what we think we have done here in the short years has been too we're still in the legacy issues that we've had but you think the current enforce portfolio as I mentioned before. Absent the weather losses as already we had in the first quarter as already in the low to mid single 90s combined ratio so, I think our strategy there is proving to be so far so good one. Jay Gelb : And a final one, if I can, the reinsurance performance in the first quarter was incredibly strong especially taking to account it was a worst first quarter for catastrophe losses in the U.S. in over 20 years, is that -- can you talk a little about whether that's risk management program structure primary companies just retaining more exposure, or what -- how come we didn't see more that impact on Everest results on the Reinsurance side? Dom Addesso : There wasn't one event right was many events which for the most part has fallen on within company retentions along with the fact that as we've mentioned each quarter for many quarters now we keep, we tend to keep moving up our attachment point there is a most competitive part of the market has been down low. And so, and it have been spreading our aggregate, so we have been diversifying our cap portfolio slightly moving up attachment point coupled with the fact that many scenes as their capital base is going to continue to retain more so it's all of those things not any one of them, but it's all of those things come into play. Jay Gelb : Thank you again. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Jay. Operator : We'll go next to Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Yes, thank you. Can I start with mortgage reinsurance, for a second? I want to know how you think about catastrophe risk versus mortgage reinsurance risk, is it similar and whatever remodeling in terms of its exposure to a mortgage catastrophe, and to how much business is there to be written out, there what's going to cause mortgage insurers want to see that risk in the future? John Doucette : Good morning, Josh. It's John. So, couple of things, so we have then as we've talked about on the last several calls focused on the mortgage opportunity within a broader credit play that we are doing, but mortgage is a meaningful part of that. And we do see -- so we have focus on that both in the underwriting side but also and arguably more importantly building out underwriting capabilities, analytical capabilities, ERM risk and very technical capabilities for us to be able to think about that really to get it -- to bring it up to the level of, which it has, we have done to the level of how have been moved to best-in-class over the last several years in the property side. So, in terms of how we think about to model it, we look at it from at the macro macro level and how it overlaps in intersection correlates with our asset portfolio. We think about it on an overall economic capital model to the group. We look at it on a realistic disaster scenario. We look at it as total limits that we deploy. We think about across years the correlation and the aggregation that can happen and really try to focus on what the economic situation is today and where we think it will be in the future so to determine how we want to play, where what attachment points we want to play at, how that would impact if something like the financial crisis of 2008 happen again, how that could perform. Joshua Shankar : So, along those lines, is it normal think that sometime in the next decade, there will be a mortgage ad event? And is there a way to have that occur and avoid the loss of the underwriting? John Doucette : Well, we have no idea if a loss is going to happen just like we don't know if catastrophe loss is going to happen. We\u2026 Joshua Shankar : I can promise you a catastrophe loss will happen in the next 10 years. I am certain of that. John Doucette : I am going to write that down. So -- but we -- we're going to build a book and have an underwriting strategy that we think will succeed based on underwriting conditions, macroeconomic conditions, pricing conditions, and we're going to adjust the book. And that's our job. That's Dom and mine and the rest of the team's job to do that to react and how we think the book will best move going forward. But we do \u2013- we certainly manage to idea that a loss could happen and try to think of limits deployed and capital required in that context. Dom Addesso : And it's also -- keep in mind that it's -- we tend to agree with you that you have to consider the fact that a loss can happen but it's also where you attach, how diversified you are. There is many factors which go into what the level of loss might be. And from a realistic disaster scenario perspective, the exposure that we have to the mortgage base is relative to property cat risk is much less and of course also relative to our capital, it's pretty small. Joshua Shankar : And then I guess one more, can we expect that if you've done your homework correctly, a well-run mortgage rebook should outperform primary mortgage book? John Doucette : I think the strength -- advantages and disadvantages of both clearly from a -- we have decided to make a reinsurance bet on it. And that gives us the benefit of hard dollar limits, that gives us the benefit of retentions, that gives us the benefit of having a compared to running an insurance operation far less resources, both capital and people wise. So, it gives us more ability to navigate the underwriting market, market cycle that could happen. So we feel like -- we feel pretty good about how we're deploying capacity and capital and our underwriting strategy and will be able to hopefully expand it if the market - the pricing and the market conditions allow but also be in a position to dial it back if we don't think we are getting paid a good risk adjusted return. Joshua Shankar : And then quickly for Jon Zaffino, I want to know how he thinks about one, three, five-year plan? When you started like at the beginning of '15, did you have a three-year plan? Do you have a five-year plan? Wouldn't you sort of in the check points to note that the insurance business is performing in line with sort of the predicted plan on how to get this be important part of Everest Re? Jon Zaffino : Sure, Josh. We have very much phased out a deliberate roadmap that aligns with what Dom mentioned before about an organic growth plan. What does that look like? What are the key milestones along that journey and how do we get there? So, certainly for us there was a few prominent themes in that process. Number one was sort of foundationally preparing the organization for that journey which is an ongoing everyday type of exercise. Certainly looking to enhance our market relevance in the form of people and products and distribution connectivity has also been very much a part of that. And then, certainly along the path we are going to make portfolio selection along the way. A lot of that work has been at the forefront of our activity in the last several quarters if not year and a half or so. But remember, we are still adding talent as we go here to make sure that we continue keep up with our growth and aspiration. So that's ongoing work. So I would say that we're very much on track. We're going to follow market opportunity where it presents itself. We don't have a sort of hard dollar specific target in mind other than we certainly see a lot of growth opportunity that we want to pursue in our chosen markets. But certainly looking to foundation prepare, refine our operations, add the talent, increase the relevance. There is a lot of work going on day to day which the tactical activity that drives success on the insurance side that we're working hard at across the board. Joshua Shankar : Well, thank you for all the answers and I appreciate the extra time. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Joshua. Operator : We will go next Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick questions here; first, I am just curious in the Bermuda segment, what was the current dollar figure of the true-up which you had in the first quarter, just so we get a good sense of kind of what the year over year growth was looking like without this true-ups, the Bermuda segment? Dom Addesso : Just one second. Brian Meredith : Sure. Dom Addesso : Yes, it's roughly about $60 million. Brian Meredith : Great, that's truly helpful. And then, second question on the credit mortgage business, I am just curious when you think about the capital allocation to that business, how do you think about it? Are you using call it rating agency models? What are you using in -- and what is the risk here that perhaps has changed and where the rating agency look at the mortgage reinsurance business to get to maybe some type of capital requiring closer to [indiscernible] particularly with quota share, would that change your kind of view of the business? Jon Zaffino : So, Brian, it's Jon. As a -- I think a couple of things. I think we feel like just overall first principle that Everest given our overall capital position and diversified book business, we feel we are pretty capital efficient in deploying capital in the areas like mortgage. We also know there has been conversations and some of the rating agencies have been looking at this fairly carefully about what the rating, how they should think about the capital required to support this book going forward. More times than not when more capital is required whether it's on the [indiscernible], or the rating agencies that puts pressure on supply. And we do that -- given our strong capital position and balance sheet and ratings, we do that as positive that will drive increases in demand and put downward pressure on supply. So, in terms of we think about it, we think about it as all of the above rating agencies with limits deployed, realistic disaster scenarios, stochastic, pricing, reserving, looking at an overall economic capital model, thinking about the assets and the liabilities and whole balance sheet. Brian Meredith : Got you. Great. And then, another just quick question here. Given that you are moving to more shorter tail type businesses which on the liability side with MI and crop and stuff, is that causing any changes in your investment portfolio and kind of where you are going to invest and proceed? Dom Addesso : No, it hasn't. The duration on the liability side really hasn't moved much approximately three years - four years, and our asset portfolio is underneath that. So that has not changed. Brian Meredith : Great, great. Thanks. And last quick question here, workers comp market, I know you guys did mention that there are some dislocation of the insurance market in general and you are taking immense opportunities there. How about he workers comp market with some of the recent activity that we are seen there, any opportunities there? Dom Addesso : In the insurance side? Brian Meredith : Yes, insurance side, sorry, yes. Dom Addesso : There are a lot of select opportunities. And we have expanded slightly some of our offerings we have expanded into some different states, but only selectively into certain states. California you know which is our biggest comp market, very profitable for us, rates are off a little bit, but we're still very bullish on sector given where rates are. And we will use comp frankly as a competitive advantage. There is a lot of -- a lot of markets we compete against that don't have comp capability and that gives us an edge to get into some other -- some of the other lines of business. So that's how we are thinking about it. Brian Meredith : Got you. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Nicholas Mezick with KBW. Nicholas Mezick : Hi, good morning everyone. Dom Addesso : Good morning. Craig Howie : Good morning. Nicholas Mezick : Thanks for fitting me in. A year ago, you mentioned that you have not done hiring in the insurance division. And in the prepared remarks today, you mentioned due to market turmoil, you have accelerated those investments. At Heartland, I see other underwriting expenses up about $9 million quarter over quarter. Where do you see the notional dollar amount is going in 2017 and 2018 or the other underwriting expense? Dom Addesso : I don't know that we have an answer for you on that because it is all dependent on market opportunity. So, we think about it more as an operating expense ratio. And I think where we are at today, we are lower, particularly as the earned premium begins to catch up, because our lead of add for resources is not necessarily plateauing but not going up at the same pace that it has been over the last 18 months as we have been building up some of these new businesses. And as these businesses have - the premium begins to earn in, the expense ratio all other things being equal, should moderate. And as Jonathan pointed out earlier, we will continue to make new additions consistent with what we see as the growth opportunity. So it's a little difficult for us to give you nominal dollar amount because that will emerge as opportunity emerges. Nicholas Mezick : Okay. And one of the governors to that sort of the sub 30 expense ratio target? Dom Addesso : Right. Nicholas Mezick : Okay, thanks. Dom Addesso : And by the way, if it remained at 30 for foreseeable future again as we pointed out before, most of our competitors aren't even close to us there. So, while everyone seems to be focused on the increase in expenses, reality is that where we are at today is competitive relative to the market. Nicholas Mezick : Just a quick follow-up on that last point, any overrides from the more conservative reinsurance program? Dom Addesso : We have overrides in our reinsurance purchases, is that what you are asking? Nicholas Mezick : Yes, that's driving the expense ratio to that sub 30 target? Dom Addesso : Not to any significant degree. We do have some overrides but that's not driving. Nicholas Mezick : Okay, thanks guys. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Dom Addesso : Well, I'll conclude by just thanking everyone for participating in this morning. And as you can surmise from our prepared comments as well as some of the answers to questions, we remain optimistic about our ability to deliver -- continue to deliver solid returns. Conservative management of our cat exposure, solid reserve position along with expense discipline and all that positions us to withstand what the market might bring to us. Coupled with growth into newer product areas and our reinsurance operations as well as what's proving to be a successful growth strategy for our insurance division, these things should continue to help us maintain our above average returns. So, thank you for your interest, and I look forward to perhaps meeting with many of you in the months ahead. Thanks again for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does include today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relation. Please go ahead. Beth Farrell : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's second quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that the statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dom Addesso : Thanks Beth and good morning to all. We're pleased to be able to report $246 million of net income for the quarter, which was $90 million above last year's second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income rose $210 million to $537 million. These results were primarily driven by excellent underwriting results of $130 million for the quarter and $313 million on a year-to-date basis, which includes $54 million of cat losses in the second quarter and $74 million in the six-month results. These results are improving year-over-year due to continued growth in premium, along with a lower combined ratio, due in part to lower catastrophe losses in the quarter. More important is the improvement evident in the Insurance segment, where we have an underwriting gain this year versus last. The attritional combined ratio for Insurance has now reached 93.6 for the quarter. The various growth and underwriting initiatives we have implemented are beginning to take hold. Overall premium is up $238 million or 17%, with growth coming from both Reinsurance and Insurance. However, on a percentage basis, Insurance is up 25%, while Reinsurance is up 14%. The growth in Insurance, which Jonathan will discuss in greater detail in a moment, is well diversified, coming from several new business units. We are extremely encouraged by the growth in all of our segments. In the Reinsurance businesses, while due to market condition, there are areas where we are contracting; there remains an array of opportunities in the credit and structured solution areas that are contributing to profitable growth. In addition, as John Doucette will cover in his report, proportional transactions, including crop reinsurance, are presenting profitable opportunities in today's market environment. The non-U.S. segments has also been a reasonable growth area for us more recently, as we have added resources there and established new locations. While Reinsurance is still a challenged space, we have been successful in achieving better than market returns due to our ability to reallocate our capacity in-scale due to better returning opportunities. Our size and relationships matter in this type of market. Scale also plays a meaningful role in the success we've been having in the Insurance segment. The ability to operate in sophisticated lines of business, with meaningful capacity and a strong balance sheet with A-plus ratings, matter to customers and brokers. These factors have also enabled us to attract terrific talent and armed with our financial strength, have propelled us to over $1 billion of premium in the first half of the year. At the same time, we have eliminated a number of underperforming businesses. For example, crop insurance and we have strengthened our reserve position, all these leading to a profitable first half. And as earned premium begins to catch up with the written premium, we would expect this profit picture to accelerate. Our Insurance operation in the best position that it's ever been, and is now a recognized market to brokers and their customers. On the investment front, there was also positive movement over the prior year as income was up 9% for the first six months. This is a result of some rotation into limited partnerships and public equities and traditional fixed income. However, our allocations are still quite conservative relative to the industry. Our investment team has done an outstanding job of enhancing performance to the cycle, while maintaining quality. Overall, our results were excellent, with an ROE of 13% for the first half, our shareholder's equity growing to $8.6 billion, and our market cap reaching $11 billion. These factors have led us to just recently being added to the S&P 500, a great accomplishment and acknowledgment to our shareholders and employees. Now, I'll turn it over to Craig for the financial reports and look forward to your questions in a bit. Thank you. Craig? Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $246 million, this compares to net income of $156 million for the second quarter of 2016. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $537 million compared to $327 million for the first half of 2016. The primary differences were unimproved underwriting result, higher capital gains, higher investment income, lower catastrophe losses, and lower foreign exchange losses compared to the first half of 2016. Net income included $50 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $30 million of capital losses in the first half of 2016. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $227 million compared to $134 million in 2016. Operating income year-to-date was $487 million compared to $357 million for the first six months of 2016. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $313 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $234 million in the same period last year. All segments reported underwriting gains for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 88.3%, down from 90.7% reported in the first half of 2016, with lower catastrophe losses contributing to this favorable variance. In the second quarter of 2017, the group saw $54 million of current year catastrophe losses net of reinsurance. Of the total, $25 million related to wildfires in South Africa, $15 million related to U.S. storms in Colorado and $14 million related to floods in Peru. This compares with $124 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2016. On the year-to-date basis, catastrophe losses totaled $74 million compared to $134 million for the first half of 2016. Excluding the catastrophe losses, the current year additional combined ratio through the first six months was 85.6%, essentially flat from 85.7% for the first half of 2016. Our expense ratio remains at 5.8% for the first two quarters of 2017. For investments, pretax investment income was $135 million for the quarter and $257 million year-to-date, on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up 9% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million for the first half of 2016, primarily due to the turnaround in energy-related investments compared to last year. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, with a duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first half of 2017, foreign exchange losses were $5 million, compared to $31 million of foreign exchange losses in the first six months of 2016. The 2016 foreign exchange losses reflected the weakening of the British pound during 2016 related to the Brexit vote. Other income also included $4 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re in the first six months of 2017 compared to $3 million of income in the first half last year. The increase reflects the lower level of catastrophe losses during the first half of 2017 compared to 2016, resulting in a higher profit share to Everest. On income taxes, similar to the first quarter of 2017, the 9% year-to-date effective tax rate on operating income was lower than the expected range for the year. The 2017 rate is lower than the 10% tax rate for the full year 2016, due to a FASB tax accounting change related to share based compensation and the utilization of foreign tax credits for years 2008 and prior. These two items reduced the effective tax rate by about one point. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would increase. Stable cash flow continues, with operating cash flows of $634 million for the first half of 2017 compared to $684 million in 2016. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2017 compared to 2016. Shareholder's equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $500 million or 6% over year end 2016. This was after taking into account capital return for $103 million of dividends paid in the first half of 2017. Our capital position remains very strong and continues to grow. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the range on its operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with $126 million of reinsurance underwriting profit. The second quarter combined ratio improved to 87.4% from 89.9% in the second quarter 2016. The loss ratio improvement of 1.2 points to 60.2% was driven by lower catastrophe losses, offset by a 3.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio. This was an anticipated outcome and was mainly due to the crop reinsurance book new this year as well as the increased property pro rata writings, offset by reduced attritional loss ratios on the international book. Total gross written premium for the second quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 14% compared to the prior Q2. This growth is due to several factors, but largely can be attributed to $54 million of crop premium associated with our strategic crop reinsurance relationship that resulted from the sale of Heartland last year. In our U.S. Reinsurance segment, second quarter gross written premium was up 17% to $475 million, driven by the new crop treaty and the impact of a large premium portfolio out in Q2 2016. The second quarter combined ratio in this segment was up eight points, primarily due to the waiting of crops and property pro rata earned premium in the quarter, with higher attritional loss ratios. While both lines have higher combined ratios, they maintained attractive ROEs due to their low capital consumption. The increased loss ratio was offset by a 1.5 point drop in the expense ratio, mainly due to lower contingent commission in the quarter. Our international Reinsurance segment second quarter gross written premium was $320 million, down 6% partly due to some large one-off deals with strategic clients written in the prior year. Net written premium for the quarter was down 3%, but up 7% on a year-to-date basis, due to the impact of timing on the receipt of several accounts. The combined ratio for the second quarter dropped to 93.7% from 115.8% in Q2 2016, due to lower catastrophe losses given the Fort McMurray wildfires and the Ecuadorian earthquake last year. The attritional loss ratio also dropped 6.2 points to 50.1% due to continued favorable loss trends. The lower loss ratio was offset by a 2.6 point increase on the expense ratio, primarily driven by the higher mix of pro rata premium affecting the commission ratio. Our Bermuda segment second quarter gross written premium increased 47% to $238 million, or up 51% on a constant dollar basis. The growth was derived from new product opportunities, timing of certain accounts, additional pro rata treaties in property, credit and casualty line, increased writings in U.K. motor, post Ogden rate changes and some large multi-class programs with core clients. The combined ratio increased to 90.3% from 88.9%, due to a 7.9 point increase in the loss ratio, offset by a 6.5 point decrease in the expense ratio. The loss ratio comparison was affected by a sizable catastrophe reserve release in 2016, a shift in business mix and an increase in the current year loss ratio, due to the change in the Ogden discount rate this year. The drop in commission was caused by a larger mix of business with naturally lower commission ratios. Turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal, Everest continued to dynamically allocate capital to opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. Rather than chase the market down on non-performing deal, we reduced or declined these and selectively deployed capacity towards deals that were priced well. On balance, this approach resulted in similar amounts of capacity deployed with only a marginal deterioration in expected returns. This ability to successfully ship risk capital to the benefit of our overall portfolio was true at 6/1 in Florida and at 7/1 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Bermuda, London, Z\u00fcrich, Singapore, China, and Australia, highlighting our very diversified portfolio and global origination capabilities. We also wrote more structured and customized transactions that are somewhat more shielded from market pressures. International property rates were, on average, down about 5% for us this 7/1, with some isolated pockets of rate increases in loss affected areas. In the U.S. property markets, June 1st XOL rates continued to edge down. Lower rated, smaller reinsurers and non-traditional players bore more of the brunt of the rate pressure as seasons gravitated to higher rated leading reinsurers like Everest, who received larger lines overall and better signings on the more attractively priced layers. We also cut participation on poorly performing XOL deals. Despite declining their placements, we typically continue to trade with many of those clients on different products or a different attachment point. We saw ongoing demand for our capacity on higher layers, where we currently find better risk-adjusted returns. This combination of strategies resulted in a better than market outcome for us, as we saw rates for our Florida XOL June 1st book being closer to down only about 3% and the rest of our U.S. July 1st book being closer to flat. In addition, having been impacted by Hurricane Matthew and AOB claim issues, Florida exposed pro rata deals saw improved reinsurance terms and we deployed more capacity accordingly to them. With our strong franchise, we've been able to increased our debt in various U.S. and international markets, continued to expand in areas dislocated by loss activity or grow with existing clients in new lines of business. Repeatedly, we are a go-to market for shortfall covers as market stabilization in these specific lines prevent deals from completing at aggressive firm order terms. In our casualty book, reinsurance terms are mostly stable, but original rate and loss trends pressure economics. We judiciously deploy our capital and cut back when necessary, favoring lines with healthier returns. Recently, some large casualty deals were not completed at the firm order terms, resulting in either not placing the deal and the clients retaining at net or the buyer had to improve terms for the reinsurers to get the deal fully placed, both signaling the casualty market is trying to find a floor. The persistent strength and financial success of the Everest franchise reflect the value that we are constantly trying to deliver to our reinsurance clients. We continually strive to build adorned and strategic client relationships, highlighted by the fact that 75% of our reinsurance clients have been trading with us for at least a decade, and over 50% of our clients worldwide have been trading with us for over 30 years. Leveraging our leading global franchise, our empowered underwriters nimbly provide customized solutions to our client, earning us a first look at new and unique opportunities. Consequently, we remained optimistic about our future and our ability to deploy capital profitably despite a tough market. All said, the mid-year renewals continued the macro theme of delivering the most value for reinsurance clients at the best costs. Thus, the reinsurance market continues to sprint towards; one, more capital efficiency through size, scale and diversification; two, alternative risk transfer mechanisms to enhance capital efficiency and best match capital to risk; three, increased focus on distribution to access profitable business, which is becoming increasingly more important; and four, improved operational and expense efficiencies. Those reinsurers that can execute on these objectives will succeed in both good and bad reinsurance markets, but those that do not could be disintermediated or diminished as the reinsurance value chain compresses. Everest continues to remain nimble in its approach to this changing market environment, adopting its operating strategies to ensure success today and into the future in the new reinsurance world order. Thank you. And now, I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jon Zaffino : Thank you, John, and good morning. Our Global Specialty Insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. The significantly transformed Everest Insurance platform continued to take shape, and the momentum we are generating in the market as a result, remains encouraging. The second quarter marks the highest level of quarterly gross written premium realized in our insurance operations history. The achievement of this milestone was a result of a highly diversified growth, generated from over 150 specialty products, despite no premium contribution from the now divested Heartland Crop portfolio. Importantly, this quarter build upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year. Most notably, when compared to the second quarter of 2016, we achieved an excess of $30 million of improvement of underwriting profit. The many strategic actions executed upon since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our results. Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period, as in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss comparative results, excluding this business. For the second quarter of 2017, the Global Insurance operations produced $569 million in gross written premium, an increase of $164 million or 41% over second quarter of 2016, a tremendous result considering the challenging market conditions. On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1 billion in gross written premium, again, another record performance. This represents growth of $240 million or 31% over the comparable period in 2016. Contributions were relatively balanced across most underwriting divisions. The significant addition of new products, which continued to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, namely accident and health in the quarter, contributed to this excellent result. This represents the 10th consecutive quarter of growth for our Global Insurance operations. Also in the quarter, our new product launches and recently assumed portfolios contributed 19% to total premium production, along with an additional 4% from our Lloyd's platform, numbers that are consistent for the year-to-date period. Let me offer a bit more context at the divisional level. Our property portfolio experienced meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. The U.S. wholesale property book, aided in part by the previously announced renewal rates transaction closed at the end of the first quarter, was a large driver of this growth. Further contributing was the steady expansion of both our inland marine and newly launched retail property groups. Growth in various other property portfolios globally was balanced and in line with our expectations. Globally, this line represents roughly 28% of our year-to-date premium production. Everest specialty underwriters, the division focused on professional and management liability and various other specialty products, also grew nearly 25% over the prior year-to-date period. Growth, however, was not experienced across the Board. Some of our management liability books were down significantly in the same period, as we simply do not find the rating environment to be supportive of our profitability ambitions. We have been able to redeploy our resources to areas within ESU that better meet our objectives. The Everest Risk Management division, which houses our primary large account casualty operation, our mono line work comp unit, the commercial casualty team, and our multinational group, also achieved meaningful growth in the quarter and year-to-date period. Overall, premium production increased 41% and 33%, respectively over the prior year quarter and year-to-date period and profitability remained solid. This business is also a strong bellwether of the growth in our brand across the market. In the case of large account primary, we worked with our brokers and risk managers to design thoughtful risk financing casualty programs, inclusive of the suite of services. There are many hurdles entering this business, yet we find ourselves in a position of growing strength as the operation continues to mature. Everest Underwriting Partners, our delegated authority operation, was essentially flat in the quarter and in fact, down 3% in the year-to-date period, yet profitability was the strongest we have seen in several quarters. Impacting our growth were various underwriting actions taken to address a few underperforming portfolios, namely nonstandard auto. Finally, our Lloyd's operation also continued its expansion. The syndicate contributed $24 million to the insurance growth in the quarter and $45 million year-to-date. The steady and cautious build of our portfolio continues with a balanced contribution from several lines of business, including professional indemnity, financial institutions, liability, accident and health, and contingency. Again, we remained deliberate in our growth pursuits and will continue to seek opportunities for profitable expansion. So, again, meaningful growth coming from balanced contributions across the global portfolio, yet not all divisions are growing as profitability remains our number one objective. Turning to net premiums, as we've shared in the past, net written premium slightly lags gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions. Net earned premium in the quarter was $364 million, an increase of $70 million or 24%. For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $688 million increased by $118 million or 21% over the prior year period. Earned premium growth has lagged in net written premium growth due to a few factors. First, our growth rate has accelerated in recent quarters, as our new underwriting divisions became fully operationalized in the market. Second, various lines of business we are writing long-term very profitable lines earned over a period longer than 12 months. As these businesses gain additional scale, we expect earned premium growth to accelerate, which we are confident will lead to growing underwriting profit. Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 99.1%, almost a 10 point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While we are pleased to have produced an underwriting profit of just over $3 million in the quarter, there were some headwinds from various cat events that distorted the progress we expect to show on a run-rate basis, which I'll get into. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.8%, a four point improvement over the first half of 2016. Our attritional results for the quarter and year-to-date period are 93.6% and 95.7%, respectively. This compares favorably to 2016's second quarter of 95.7% and 95.8% year-to-date. So, again, improvement in the quarter and stability on the year-to-date results. The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved significantly from the prior year period to 70.3% from 80.2%. As you will recall, the second quarter of 2016 was impacted by significant cat activity from the Texas hailstorms and the Fort McMurray wildfires, which combined, had a 13.1 point impact to the loss ratio. While this quarter was also impacted by a variety of well-publicized cat events, it was not the same magnitude of last year. On an attritional basis, the second quarter 2017 loss ratio improved to 64.8%, three points better than the 67.8% attritional produced for the first quarter of this year and two points better than the attritional loss ratio of 66.9% in the second quarter of 2016. We are beginning to see the drift down in the attritional loss ratio based upon improved mix, the benefits from the many new businesses launched and the strategic underwriting actions of the past two years. Looking at the year-to-date period. The GAAP loss ratio improves to 69.3% in the prior year up 74.3%, a five point betterment. The attritional loss ratio also improves a full point to 66.2% from 67.3%. A few additional comments. First, as I mentioned, the second quarter experienced another elevated level of cat activity in the U.S. PCS cat event 17/32, the Colorado hailstorms, in particular, impacted our North American results by almost four points. Second, the significant convective storm event across the first and second quarter added roughly two points to our attritional loss ratios. Certainly, all manageable outcomes, based on the profitable growth in our earned premium base, but nonetheless creating some quarterly pressure on the results. We also recognized a small amount of adverse prior year development from our non-standard auto book of nearly two points in the quarter. This is an area we continue to deemphasize in our go-forward portfolio. Offsetting these increases to our loss ratio was a four point improvement in the accident and health division exiting year loss ratio. Our A&H group delivered an outstanding quarter. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 28.8%, down from the first quarter result of 30.2%. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio is 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.5% in the comparable period of 2016. Our operating expense ratio for the second quarter was 12.5% compared to 12.4% for the prior year quarter, essentially flat. Year-to-date operating expenses were 12.8% for 2017 compared to 12.2% last year. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue upon our growth plan and as earned premium continues to come through. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the Specialty Insurance segment. Turning to the operating environment, the second quarter trended quite similar to the first quarter. Suffice it to say that it's a competitive market and underwriting excellence is paramount in this environment. Clarity of risk appetite, clear knowledge of the rating environment, and the thoughtful assumption of risks are all key attributes of our approach. As in prior quarters, the overall level of rate change can vary meaningfully by major line of business. In general, and outside of commercial and personal auto, there are various degrees of rate pressure. Worker's compensation, particularly in California; professional liability; and various casualty lines are all feeling some degree of mild pressure, generally in the flat to mid-single-digit range, again consistent to prior quarters. Commercial and personal auto remained the outliers and are each achieving low double-digit rate increases across our portfolio. As discussed in prior calls, we feel the U.S. property market continues to find the bottom. While the rate environment has not turned consistently positive yet, we feel it is flattening out, again, with some caveat between cat and non-cat exposed areas. So, another quarter of predictable trend for each line, yet with a tone of stabilization across the overall portfolio. In conclusion, we are pleased with our results to-date. As our portfolio continues to gain scale, we are encouraged by the increased resiliency of our platform to achieve underwriting profitability. Our additional results are a special especially encouraging. Our many new and existing colleagues continue to execute well on their individual underwriting mandates and we look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. Now back to Beth for Q&A. Beth Farrell : Thank you, John. Operator, we are ready to take questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Elyse Greenspan. Elyse Greenspan : Hi good morning. My first question on the reinsurance growth, pretty strong growth again in the quarter. Last quarter, you guys have pointed to about high single-digits growth as the sustainable level that you saw at the time for the book. The second quarter was stronger than that, and I think part of that was probably due to the some of those property pro rata signings you pointed out. But how do you see -- I mean, the rest of the year trending just in terms of on the growth prospects of your Reinsurance business? Just based off how you so June and July renewals? And how you're thinking things through right now? Dom Addesso : Elyse, this is Dom. I'll ask John to comment as well. As we mentioned and you mentioned, part of it was due to the shift to couple of new proportional deals which that earned premium and that will have an impact on the remainder of the year, so that will affect premium growth. And then also, crop the -- crop reinsurance transaction, which will also have similar impact on the remainder of the year. But absent that, the renewable seasons are pretty much over, other than we had in July 1. But again, most of the activities in the first half of the year in terms of renewals and new business opportunities. The growth areas for us though continued to be mortgage credit, structured solution and that's where -- absent the other items I just mentioned, that's where, frankly, the growth opportunities are and that our previous guidance on that in terms of growth. As you indicated, the high single-digit would still remain unless John has anything to add to that. John Doucette : No, I agree. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of the Insurance business, pretty strong growth and a lot of commentary that you guys gave. If the growth remains at 40%, do you think that based off of how you put it all together, that you could maintain an underlying margin in the low 90s? And one question I had, you did call out, Jon, convective storms of about two points, is that stuff that fell outside of your cat definition in the Q2? Meaning, the margin might have been better adjusting for that, I'm just trying to tie that together. Dom Addesso : Yes, the two points that Jonathan referenced falls within the attritional number that he quoted. So, it's not -- in our vernacular, it's not a cat. There are cat events, but they don't get disclosed by us as a cat, where we quoted in our numbers as a catastrophe, it is in the attrition. And again, in terms of growth, I think we set for some time that we would anticipate an improvement in our attritional and we'll have those levels where we think it is sustainable. We have great diversification across the entire platform, so we're not dependent on any one line of business or any one product, which not unlike the reinsurance sector, enable us to increase our capacity or increase our appetite and those lines of business that we feel or giving us the requisite profit and return our capital, and deemphasize those class of business that are not. It doesn't mean we totally withdraw, but it allows us to shift our capacity around. So, several new business units and allows for greater diversity across the entire platform. Johnathan? Jon Zaffino : No. That's [Indiscernible] Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then one last question. Can you talk -- the losses in the quarter, you guys saw some losses in the South Africa and Peru, can you just talk about your exposure there? And what kind of returns are you getting in normalized years in both of those markets? Jon Zaffino : Good morning Elyse, Jon. So, we write a significant portion of our business outside the U.S. and have been strong in many countries around the world including those and we write -- in each of those countries, we have a strong franchise and an attractive book of business that we've been writing for many years. They would typically run in the 80s across the cycle. So, 80s combined ratio, it could go up or down based on cat activity. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Elyse. Operator : We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. The first question is on -- follow- up on Insurance segment. The second quarter topline grows 41% ex-crop and margin improvement of 210 basis points, very impressive. I just wonder, you mentioned it's very competitive marketplace. Could you tell us a little more how exactly do you gain market share in the marketplace? And why, after improving your margin because I'm assuming if you grow very fast, you probably -- there are certain so-called, I don't know the terms, new business apparently apply to this line of business as well. Can you maintain the margin or even improve the margin going forward? Dom Addesso : Kai, this is Dom. I don't necessarily agree with your assertion or assumption that growth comes -- with growth underwriting deterioration. As I just kind of described in response to Elyse's question, the diversification across many different product segments allows us to maintain our underwriting integrity and increase capacity to those lines of business getting adequate returns. We do think that we are improving our traditional, there still some improvement that we think we can garner particularly in the Property segment, remembering that the first half of the year. So, Property, as Jonathan pointed out, had a number of cat events, but also, as we described in non-cat events, adding two points of the attritional, and we anticipate that, as the year plays out, that we'll some improvement in those areas. So, we would certainly anticipate an improvement in combined ratio picture on the insurance side, again, coming from diversity, diversification most business unit, and products within those business units. And remembering that we are a specialty insurer, and we are not commercial. We're not into [Indiscernible] business or those areas that are subject to, in our views, some of the more competitive pressures in the marketplace. Craig Howie : I would just add to that Kai that there's really a couple of things here to remember. Number one is that we have doubled our underwriting staff over the last two years. So, we had a lot more boots on the ground, seeking profitable opportunities in the lines of business we have chosen. Secondly, we have launched literally dozens of products. So, to Dom's point about diversification across platform, it significant, it's coming from a number of different areas. To the point I tried to raise earlier, it's not -- growth is not linear across our platform, it's not all moving in lock step. There are several actions being taken still to try to drive a better attritional result. So, we're seeing now the effects of all those efforts that have happened over the last couple of years. Kai Pan : Thank you for the expanse answers. My second question on the Reinsurance side. You talked a little bit more about what caused the deterioration, 210 basis points, what are the moving parts? And you mentioned about the crop reinsurance, about property pro rata treaties. How much -- could you quantify how much each basically contributed to the year-over-year deterioration? And do you think that will be a normal stable run rate going forward? Dom Addesso : Well, what the stable run rate. The attritional that we have on the reinsurance? Kai Pan : Yes, exactly. Yes. Dom Addesso : Well, some of that is dependent upon what happens with future rate levels, right? And I don't know that we have all the details that could give you that. So, we do have some of it. So, growth in crop that have 4.6 point impact, we had -- some of the increase due to pro rata had an impact of approximately three points, so that will give you some indications on the attrition. That's what what's driving the higher attrition. Kai Pan : That's in the U.S. Reinsurance segment? Dom Addesso : That's U.S., yes. Kai Pan : Okay, great. Last one-- Dom Addesso : On the international side, we had explained improvement in some of the operations there, Middle East, Africa, showing some improvement in the non-cat loss trend and that we had Bermuda site, we had an increased due to higher ERR on some of the treaty -- higher ERR picked on some of the treaties we've written. So, it varies across the entire portfolio. And the reason I kind of go through some of these in detail is reflect the fact that, it's what I said before, Everest has -- generally is an operational strategy, moves around various lines of businesses and I can't tell you necessarily what 1/1, for example, will bring us and we could change our portfolio again. So, it's little difficult to answer. John Doucette : And Kai, this is John. Just to add a little bit color to that. And a lot of this is -- you also may be better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarter, because there's always going to be quarterly volatility just from large risk losses that happen, non-cat-cat events or weather losses that happen that that move these things around. So, we think the year-to-date attritional combined ratio is more reflective for the Reinsurance operation. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you so much. I probably back in the queue. Thank you. John Doucette : Thank you, Kai. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Yes, good morning everyone. You guys have already surprised [ph] yourselves on expense ratio and expense management were not being much better than peers; to what extent you need to grow the Insurance business to be competitive from an expense management standpoint? Dom Addesso : What do we need to grow the expense ratio to? Joshua Shanker : No, the overall volumes for your scale where you think you said that you cannot have a competitive run rate expense ratio better than peers? Jon Zaffino : Hi, Josh, this is Jon. I think we're there. Generally, I think-- Joshua Shanker : You're there. You're there now. Jon Zaffino : We're there now. I mean, if you look at where we are year-to-date, I think that expense ratio compared to those who write the lines of business we do across the geographies we write them, I think it will stock up very, very well, in fact well above the pure average. Secondly, when you look at a lot of the activities that we have pursued, our investments have been all across our platform. We're equally excited about the investments we're making our claims department, our actuarial teams, technology, et cetera. So, I think we have a pretty good feel for the expenses that are coming into the system and against the earned premiums that we're forecasting. I think we feel pretty good about it. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And as you grow, obviously requires more capital, you're not buying back stock; you're using it to grow your business. Are you growing at the pace of excess capital generation or is that the limiting factor that you had more capital; you could grow faster or you growing faster than you're generating capital? Dom Addesso : Our capital growth is kind of consistent with our premium growth. Our premium growth is -- we have sufficient capital for the growth that we've had for the first half of the year. If anything, our excess capital position has maybe just inched up a very little bit, but not enough to warrant that we would increase -- go back in terms of the short-term. We've purchased particularly at the levels that are stock of that today. Joshua Shanker : Okay. That's that. And thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll next to Mayor Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Good morning. Two really quick questions. One, is it fair to infer with U.S. Reinsurance that the movement to higher attachment point is limiting your exposure to what seems to have been really bad non-catastrophe weather? John Doucette : Hi, Meyer, this is John. There's certainly some of that, that we -- and I think that you saw that last quarter as well, that some of the noise. So, in general, market losses of certain size are going to be more an Insurance loss than a Reinsurance loss. And I think, directionally, given what we've been doing with the book, it would mean that it would take larger, the real noteworthy headline cat losses and not just the things you see on TV with the good video images. It would really take larger ones to cause larger losses for us. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thanks. And then broadly, I guess, this would be Insurance and Reinsurance. There's been a lot of commentary about sort of accelerating social inflation, are you seeing that? How are you booking that in your current accident effect [ph]? Dom Addesso : I'll ask Craig to speak to that. Craig Howie : I'm sorry could you repeat the question? Dom Addesso : Social inflation and its impact on our portfolio? Craig Howie : I think we always take a look at what the inflation is when we look at loss cost trend on the overall portfolio, Meyer. And we look at not only social inflation, but we look at everything that's going on claim inflation, social inflation. We look at the frequency and severity of the claims as they come through as well. But that's always part of our process as we go through picking our loss estimates. John Doucette : And Meyer its John, just to add a little more. I think also there's no one simple one line answer to that. We have -- across the group, we have 300 IBNR groups in many lines of business, in many territories around it and what -- and how social inflation or claims inflation or other things like that are driving loss cost. It is dynamic, it varies. I would say though that we have spent a lot of time between feedback loops, between pricing actuaries and underwriters and reserving estuaries and the underwriting and pricing to make sure that we are thoughtful and how we think about that, and are able to respond to what we see as changing market condition. Dom Addesso : And that's not something that's new to the industry. It's something that all companies have to deal with. And if you look at our reserving history, I think it demonstrates that we're properly taking those factors into account and establishing our reserve position. Meyer Shields : Right. No, that's very helpful. I'm just -- I'm trying to get a handle on whether on the sort of simplistic trends or aggregate trends that we look at from the outside with anything material going on? Dom Addesso : No, loss cost trend obviously have been rather tamed for a number of years. And it's a little tough to project when that social inflation for example kicks in, but general inflation, of course, has been relatively modest. Other than healthier trends, of course, which impacts [Indiscernible]. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Any -- I don't think we have any other questions on the call? Operator : We'll go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you for a couple of follow-ups. First one, there's on your Lloyd's business, recently there are some additional interest in the acquisition in the marketplace you're building your own, at this time, do you prefer build versus buy? Dom Addesso : Across all of our businesses, that's our preference. It doesn't mean, however, that we wouldn't -- if something came across our desk that looked very strategic and could propel us to a different level more quickly and didn't have huge integration issues and/or legacy concerns, we would certainly consider it. And of course, if you're pointing to Lloyd's, but I would say that Lloyd's is a platform. It's not necessarily the entire strategy if you will. It's a platform that enables us to execute our Continental European strategy as well as outside of North America and Europe. And we can -- we have other areas that we are pursuing, our other platforms that we're considering again internal build that would enable us to move forward on those ventures. Kai Pan : Okay. Last one if I may for Craig, it's about tax rates. What's your normalized tax rate if you think about your budget level of catastrophe losses? Craig Howie : Well, we typically have looked at the range before Kai. When we look at our tax rate, we essentially go and we look at with and without catastrophe losses as you've heard us say in the past. So, last year for 2016, was a mild year for tax rates, but -- and we had a full year effective tax rate of about 10%. What I would say to you is, if we had no catastrophes in the year, in other words, more taxable income, that rate could go as high as up to 13%. But that would give you a relative range of where I would expect to be. Kai Pan : Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for your time and good luck. Craig Howie : All right. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Kai. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Addesso for any additional or closing remarks. Dom Addesso : Again thank you very much. And thanks again to all for your participation this morning in the call and your questions. As we mentioned, the growth in the first half for us has been strong both Insurance and Reinsurance, but our first priority continues to be underwriting profit. That's why you see us continually optimizing our portfolio on the Reinsurance side, for example, as we change attachment points, increase pro rata, non-renewal certain layers, diversify into various regions, and rotate into other risk classes like mortgage, credit, or structured solutions. So, it is with an emphasis on an underwriting profit. In the Insurance segment, our underwriting strategy is a product specialty and diversification again, which is, as I said earlier, allows us to provide capacity to the most attractive areas and also clearly minimize the impact of any one line of business to the extent it reaches some difficulty. So, diversification and specialization remain cornerstone of what we do. And so for the reasons that I just mentioned, we remain optimistic that through the cycle, we can outperform the overall market. Again, thank you very much and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Farrell : Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President of North American Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dominic James Addesso : Thanks, Beth, and good morning. Let me begin by first extending our sympathies to all those affected by the recent events. Community at large has responded to the relief efforts, but still there is more that can be done. I'm especially proud of the way our organization has responded on both the business and personal front. We have advanced moneys to our Reinsurance clients, so they in turn can quickly settle with their insurers, allowing them to start the process of rebuilding our lives and businesses sooner. On the insurance front, our claim staff is working diligently to do the same. These events teared us with many personal stories, but also remind us of the value that our industry and company can bring during times like this. We protect against volatility and therefore expect the periodic loss that we will discuss this morning. This means, of course, that during times of limited catastrophe loss activity, we should be able to produce strong results. It also means that after a series of events that claimed $100 billion from the system, there needs to be a reset in the market as we reevaluate pricing, terms and conditions, and the impact the recent years softening has had on the industry's risk-adjusted returns. For this reason, we believe that these recent events will lead to a general market firming across all lines and territory. In non-loss affected areas, the push will be to achieve adequate return levels over a reasonable timeframe. Events like these create a greater awareness in the market around the cost of capital and the price of risk. For those regions affected by loss, the price reaction will be more pronounced. This will start with the retro market since it is heavily supported by the collateralized market, whose capital is in large part locked up. This may very well create some unique opportunities for us, especially given our capital position coming out of these events. The firming of the retro market will also have a beneficial downstream impact on the rest of the property catastrophe market, and may very well push into other lines. We anticipate that well rated capacity will be in demand, and this will drive better rates, terms and conditions across the spectrum. Given our strong risk management practices, and laddered protection mechanisms, the losses from these events remained well within our expectations. One important factor, that is often overlooked is the tax benefit that is used to offset the loss. We manage our PML on a net basis, meaning net of tax and reinsurance hedges, despite many publications that only highlight our gross PMLs. Considering the reinsurance and tax recoveries against the third quarter events, our net operating loss for the nine months stands at $180 million. This suggests that with a normal operating result in the fourth quarter, inclusive of our cap cat load, we could achieve a profit for the full year. This would be an excellent outcome in a year with an unprecedented level of catastrophe losses. We managed to these types of scenarios and measure our success over the long term, as we recognize there will be periods of volatility. Over the last five years, including results so far in 2017, our average return on equity is 12%, which we consider exceptional relative to the industry. This is a testament to the long-term value of our strategy. The emerge from these events with a strong capital base and ample reinsurance capacity with our growing Mt. Logan facility, multi-year cap bonds and other third-party regions. And are therefore ready to respond to the new market demand. While I recognize, that the cat events are deservedly getting the focus. Let me now turn your attention to the underlying business trends, that support our long-term success. On the reinsurance front, our effective use of third-party capital has allowed us to grow the book and profits during periods of low cat active. But yet during one of the highest cat years in recent times contained the loss within full year earnings. Using alternative capital for U.S. cat exposure has allowed for expansion and diversification to other regions as well as other lines of business. Another expansion opportunity we have leverage with this essentially expanded capital base is our insurance business. For the past two years, we have experienced growth of over 20% in a balanced and well-diversified fashion. With that growth and repositioning has come an improvement in the underlying attritional ratios. A $2 billion of annual premium and growing, we are now in a known market that brings capacity and ratings to meet the needs of the commercial and specialty marketplace. The underpinnings of our collective organization have never been stronger. While this year is challenge from an income perspective over the long-term we are delivering what we promised, higher ROEs that the industry with our disciplined expense model and cat losses that on an average are within our expected outcomes. But I continually remind people, there are never any losses than we don't have a business. The goal is to produce an above average ROE through the cycle. And we believe we have thus far delivered and we'll continue to do so. Thank you. And we'll now have Craig for the financial report. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a net loss of $639 million or $15.73 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $295 million dollars for the third quarter last year or $7.6 per diluted common share. The operating loss for the quarter was $16.43 per share reflecting the catastrophe losses in the quarter and the foreign exchange losses of over $1 per share, which is the primary difference from the consensus. The operating loss excludes realized capital gains and losses. You will note that 2017 earnings per share calculations utilized basic common shares instead of diluted shares, due to the loss in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The group had a net loss on a year-to-date basis of $102 million compared to $623 million of net income in 2016. These results were impacted by a series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures. In the third quarter of 2017, the group saw $1.2 billion of net pre-tax catastrophe losses, with a net economic impact of $900 million after taxes. The breakdown on the pre-tax loss by event is as follows. Hurricane Harvey was $270 million, Hurricane Irma was $475 million, Hurricane Maria was $400 million, and the earthquakes in Mexico were $85 million. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates, and we expect it will take several months before relative clarity emerges from the multiple events. However, the company has significant unused retrocessional capacity, including aggregate protections, which would provide coverage above these estimated levels. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to $143 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.6% through the first nine months compared to 8.52% for the same period in 2016. Our year-to-date expense ratio remains low at 5.3% due to higher earned premium, including reinstatement premiums after the catastrophe event this quarter. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $137 million for the quarter and $394 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up 10% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up over $20 million for the first nine months of 2016. We've been able to maintain investment yield without a shift in our overall investment portfolio. However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by reducing exposure to high-yield debt and public equity while committing more towards limited partnership investments all while maintaining a conservative well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% and the duration remained at just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported in other income. Foreign exchange losses were $43 billion in the third quarter or over $1 of earnings per share. Year-to-date foreign exchange losses were $48 million compared to $29 million of foreign exchange losses in the first nine months of 2016. The foreign exchange impact is effectively an accounting mismatch since its offset in shareholders' equity mismatch since its offset in shareholders equity through translation adjustments. Overall, we maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign exchange matching assets with liabilities in most major world currencies. Other income also included a $6 million loss from Mt. Logan Re in the first nine months of 2017, compared to $10 million of income in the same period last year. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses during 2017. On income taxes, the tax benefit is based on the actual year-to date-loss, not the annualized effective tax rate. We would expect any fourth quarter income to be taxed at an effective rate of about 10%. Stable cash flow continues with operating cash flows of over $1 billion for the first nine months of 2017, compared to $961 million dollars in 2016. We expect this will decline as we pay claims for the recent catastrophe events, but still remain positive for the year. Shareholders equity for the group was $8 billion dollars at the end of the third quarter leaving us well-positioned to take advantage of business opportunities. Thank you. Now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As a leading global reinsurer, we have consistently achieved industry-leading results in periods with low catastrophe loss activity. But the true test of our franchise and business strategies is our ability to demonstrate resilience in a quarter in any year with several major catastrophe losses or other large unusual shock losses. While some characteristics of the recent property loss activity were unusual, the magnitude of insured losses was well within our expectations, owing to our proactive and comprehensive risk management efforts. Learning from other large catastrophe and sharp loss years such as 2001 World Trade Center, 2005 Katrina Rita and Wilma hurricanes, 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2011, a string of losses including earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, floods in Thailand and Australia and severe convective storms in the U.S. We have continually enhanced and refined our group-wide enterprise risk management framework. This includes our large risk and catastrophe strategy, across all underwriting areas within the company. And now, both our reinsurance and insurance portfolios, each are expected to benefit from the post loss market condition. This applies across our underwriting risk spectrum, from property insurance to facultative, to proportional treaty, to property catastrophe access of watch treaty and ultimately, to retro. We believe it is essential that a global industry leading specialty reinsurer and insurer, such as avarice. Truly understand its risks and develop a comprehensive resilient business strategy that allows us to stand with our clients, while protecting our investors capital, a proactive, farsighted approach is critical to the continuity of an enduring franchise. Expect the unexpected, as every loss is different and unique. This includes relentless preparation for Black Swan and other tail events for an accumulation of varying losses across multiple lines of business. Everest continues to be well-positioned to bring tailored solutions and value to our reinsurance clients. We pride ourselves not just on paying our clients losses quickly and efficiently, but also maintaining our financial strength in a quarter with unprecedented catastrophe loss activity. More importantly, we provide continuity to our clients going on the offense and providing additional support and capacity when it is needed most. With our global geographic and line of business diversification across our underwriting portfolio, strong earnings power and substantial capital resources. We have once again demonstrated the success of our business strategies, which insulate the balance sheet from larger events such as those just experienced. As we head into the one-one \u2013 1/1 renewals and onward into 2018, we will continue to harness capital whether in the form of traditional equity and debt, Kilimanjaro catastrophe bonds, Mt. Logan or other forms of traditional and nontraditional reinsurance capital. Across the spectrum, our Accordion-like capital structures provide ample dry powder to deploy commensurate with market opportunities. We remain very well positioned today and our existing hedges remain substantially intact with the vast majority of our $2.8 million of cat bond still in force and unexhausted, coupled with a growing Mt. Logan capital structure both of which help Everest efficiently manage its overall net risk appetite. Uniquely, we manage alternative capital in a fashion that believes our clients around the globe from the complexities and structural weaknesses of collateral, lock-up and release mechanism from unrated reinsurers, while delivering to our clients, our evergreen promise to pay from our highly rated balance sheet as we have proven over the last 45 years. Additionally, we have a significant portfolios of business across the entire P&C opportunity set, including meaningful books of business in mortgage, casualty, professional liability, structured reinsurance, international property, specialty, and other short tail lines throughout the world that have been unaffected by recent cat loss activity. Thus, our global geographic and business line diversification decreases volatility from any one line of business. Profits from these diversifying lines and territories offset losses such as those recently experienced in the U.S. and Caribbean. Going forward, we are ready and eager to capture market opportunities that convert the value we provide to our clients in the returns for our shareholders. We are especially pleased that we will one of the few reinsurers immediately deploying capital post-event as we actively quoted backup covers in all loss affected areas to meet the needs of our clients, whether they were U.S. regional clients, large U.S. national clients, retro clients, Lloyd's syndicate or Caribbean reinsurance clients with financial strength and resilience, we are headed into the January renewal with the clear message that Everest is open for business. However, that does not mean we will write reinsurance business at any price. As we have supported our core clients through hard and soft market cycle, the recent losses are reminder of the value that we deliver. As in the past, we will deploy our capital where that value is most recognized while reducing our positions on business with less attractive pricing terms and conditions. Our clients can rely on us to offer our reinsurance capacity whether the same or a higher amount of capacity needed as long as it meets an appropriate return on capital, and the cost of that capital has gone up with the industry. Now turning to specifics on our results. Excluding reinstatement premiums, gross-written premiums for our reinsurance operation increased 13% for the quarter and 15% year-to-date with broad-based growth in our U.S. and Bermuda operations from crop reinsurance, mortgage, strategic quota shares, [indiscernible] (00:21:00) business, international surety and property and structured reinsurance. Growth was offset slightly by lower international premium volume in the third quarter due to the renewal of certain structured deal that ran their course. This underscores our ability to not only seize opportunity in property cap business, but to continue to write and expand our franchise in diversifying and value-added lines for our client. While this quarter's reinsurance underwriting results were heavily impacted by the catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying trends in these businesses remain solid. The reinsurance operations overall attritional loss ratio was up 2.6 points on a year-to-date basis against the comparable period of 2016. This was due to growth in pro rata and crop business, both with naturally higher loss ratios, offset by some favorable loss trends in our international operations. Our year-to-date attritional expense ratio dropped over two points benefiting from a business mix with naturally lower commissions. Despite this year's loss activity, in the long-term, the reinsurance market will continue to trend towards more efficient capital management and scale with better operational and expense management. We believe we are very well positioned both now and into the future. Our ability to execute on these key drivers provides value to our clients and our shareholders in both hard and soft markets. Our strategy remains nimble and dynamic, and enables us to thrive in this ever-changing market. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thank you, John, and good morning. As catastrophic events unfolded in the third quarter, particularly of the magnitude at scale that occurred across North America, the resulted impact to the primary insurance market has been predictably quite significant. While the Everest Global Insurance operations were not immune to the impact of this widespread devastation, the performance of our various books of business, notably our U.S. property portfolio were in line with our expectations. Further, we are pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. We are increasingly confident that our vision to organically build a world-class diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Our leading gross written premiums, our enhanced operating platform, the many new product launches, our successful talent acquisition strategies and our growing relationship with a diverse group of trading partners is a testament to this approach. Progress on our journey is also fairly measured by an increasingly resilient underlying combined ratio, which again was solidly profitable for the quarter. Notably in the quarter, we were pleased to receive conditional approval from the Central Bank of Ireland for our newest European operating platform Everest Insurance Ireland. This is another example of the thoughtful organic build of our franchise and the expansion of our global underwriting operation. Our Irish operating companies will be an important component of our overall international insurance strategy, and is an excellent complement to both our North American and Lloyd's operation. I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter, following this I'll provide some comments on the cat activity experienced within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. As in prior quarters, due to the divestiture of Heartland in late third quarter of 2016, I will discuss our comparative results excluding this business. For the third quarter of 2017, the global insurance operations produced $480 million in gross written premium, an increase of $109 million or 30% over third quarter 2016. Another tremendous result and a recognition of our growing relevance in the specialty P&C market. On a year-to-date basis, we achieved $1.5 billion in gross written premium, again another solid performance. This represents growth of $349 or 31% over the comparable period in 2016. As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting \u2013 underlying divisions within the Everest insurance global platform. This also represents the 11th consecutive quarter of growth for our global insurance operation. Turning to net premium, as we have shared in the past. Net premium slightly lagged gross written premium growth, due to the marginally more conservative reinsurance position we have taken to support the growth across our underwriting divisions. Net earned premium in the quarter was $376 million, an increase of $63 million or 20%. For the year-to-date period net earned premium of $1.1 billion, increased by $181 million or 21 or excuse me 20% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 141.4%, clearly impacting by the catastrophe activity in the quarter, which contributed 43.5 points to this result. The attritional combined ratio however was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the third quarter's 16 attritional of 99.5. The underlying loss ratio for the third quarter of this year was 68.4%, a 1.4 point improvement over last year's 69.8%. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 113.9, was again nearly 17 points of cat included in this result. The year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operation is producing 96.5%, which also compares favorably to the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016. Again the underlying loss ratio shows 1.2 points of improvement on a year-to-date basis coming in at 67% from the prior year 68.2%. Year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift in the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new businesses launch and strategic underwriting actions of the past two years. Our expense ratio in the third quarter was 29.5% essentially flat from the 29.7% from the same period last year. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio remains 29.5%, up slightly from the 28.9% in the comparable period of 2016. As we have stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. Turning now to the cat picture for the quarter. As you heard from Dom and John, Everest as an organization deploys a proactive and multifaceted approach to risk management. The insurance organization is deeply ingrained in the same processes and hence adopt many of the same views and strategies. The third quarter of 2017 certainly tested the efficacy of these strategies and the insurance operations results were consistent with our expectations and well within our tolerances. In addition to measuring our performance against modeled assumptions, we also gauge our performance against industry loss and market share analysis, and of course from a fundamental of bottom-up view of our underwriting decisions with a keen focus on any outliers that may emerge from these underwriting strategies and assumptions. Again, again for all of these measures, the various books of business performed well and has anticipated and consistent with our global view of Everest. And to put this in further perspective, we estimate roughly $160 million in net pre-tax losses from the three large cat events of Harvey, Irma and Maria. With the concentration of loss emanating for Harvey and Irma. The majority of this exposure was originated from our U.S. property underwriting division, covering the wholesale, retail and in the Marine markets, with some minor contributions from our Lloyd's platform. This loss is against roughly $450 million in annualized worldwide property insurance premium, and roughly $2 billion of similarly annualized premium within the overall insurance operation. Together these data points suggest that these events are in proportion to our portfolio, and again within our various models of expectations. One final comment on the cat side. It is important to remember that we are in the middle innings of a significant transformation of our insurance platform. As we have stated previously, this has caused a temporary lag in our earned premium and several of our new underwriting divisions have yet to achieve critical mass. As these new units continue to grow, as we are demonstrating quarter-after-quarter. We expect that our short tail property exposure will be even more balanced against the larger non-property base. This will further allow us to drive the consistent profitable results, we have been experiencing more recently in our attritional combined ratios. As for the question on market conditions, it is a very fluid situation and will take some months to find a balanced view. In fact, the current market is evidencing a fair amount of pricing volatility across lines. As we work through this adjustment process. Overall and as we stated we do believe there is a need for rate firming. Certainly within the property market cat and non-cat like and also in other markets. It is our sense that general farming will continue to occur across property line to different degrees and other major lines of business are likely to experience positive rate movement. Remember certain casualty lines of business mainly commercial auto have been experiencing rate increase for many quarters and based on underlying loss cost trends, that need to continue. Other lines of business likewise need to adjust proper technical pricing. And I believe the industry at all levels understands that we can perpetuate in an environment where pricing persist below these technical levels. Again each market, each geography in each line of business are different; however, they need to achieve adequate technical pricing remains universal, that is our focus. In conclusion, despite the impact of the cat event in the quarter, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The underlying performance of our diverse books of business are encouraging and we feel we are well-positioned to create value for all of our constituents and the evolving market ahead. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. Now, back to Beth for Q&A. Elizabeth Farrell : Thank you, Jon. Jennifer, we are open for questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll have our first through Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. My first question just going back to your introductory comments, when you pointed to marking farming across all lines in territories. I just, if we can get more color on you know, I mean, if \u2013 is this depending on alternative capital, reloading or not reloading following the events, I guess, how do you see the dynamics underlying the market firming as we get closer to the January 1 renewals? Dominic James Addesso : Well, there's a number of factors, Elyse, that lead us to believe that there is an [ph] opening market (33:42). First of all, starting with the various industry events that clearly we have been attending throughout the past month starting with Monte Carlo and moving on to PCI and Baden and the CIAB. The strength of the market in terms of [ph] its resolve (34:01) continue to increase based on our assessment and various talking with customers, brokers, [ph] and other markets (34:09). So, that's number one. And underpinning all that has been what I've been saying for some time is that the returns on capital, return on equity of the industry in general, as you all know, has been in the mid single-digit for a period of time. And therefore, these types of events are unsustainable with mid single-digit ROEs in times of low to no cat activity. So, clearly, the market has been below technical pricing adequacy. So, that's number one. With respect to alternative capital coming back in, start off with a good portion, a significant portion of alternative capital is locked up. And it's our belief that certainly some new capital will come back in, but it's not clear yet that 100% of that, at least in the short term, is ready to move back in. And frankly, alternative capital is not going to come back in unless it sees some price improvement. So, that's my fundamental belief as to why I think there will be a market firming. I don't think it's dependent on alternative capital. There's technical pricing needs across many of our lines of business, not just property, and there has been a reassessment of cost of capital [indiscernible] (35:49) Elyse Greenspan : What level of rate do you think we could see on both loss and potentially non-loss impacted accounts? Dominic James Addesso : I knew we would eventually get to that question, and I'm not necessarily going to say that we're expecting X percent by this timeframe. I think we will see in the retro market a very, very strong double-digit rate increases early on, and perhaps that would last into a second renewal season. That of course, as you know, with firm retro pricing that has a waterfall impact on the rest of property cat. We're already, as Jonathan somewhat alluded to, on the primary side. It's mixed, early days, but we are seeing \u2013 beginning to see some price movement upward, but that will take a longer period of time to get to what we believe will be rate adequacy. So, at the primary level, ultimately, it's in the early days, it's high single-digit, but that might take several months to really play out. On the reinsurance front, straight up property cat, I think will start in the teens, again in loss affected areas and perhaps that will take multiple years to play out. But it is \u2013 we don't know for sure, but clearly, we are approaching the January 1 renewals with the anticipation that rates are going up. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. And then, also if you could talk about the potential implications on the tax side if [ph] the NIL bill (37:34) is included within tax reform? Dominic James Addesso : Potential implications to the industry to us? What is \u2013 where is the... Elyse Greenspan : For Everest, sorry. For you guys specifically. Dominic James Addesso : There is many derivations of that. We have various companies that are in place obviously in the U.S., in Bermuda, in Ireland, in other jurisdictions and we have capital in most of those locations. So, depending on what the final shape of that bill is, we'll dictate where we position our capital and what companies we will be running business on. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Dominic James Addesso : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you, and good morning. First question, just a follow-up on Elyse's question on alternative capital. How much was the total losses for Mt. Logan and what's your investors sort of risk appetite after those events? Dominic James Addesso : Let me ask Craig the total loss for Mt. Logan. Craig Howie : The total loss for Mt. Logan was almost $200 million. And then, of course [indiscernible] (38:57) income as well. So, you'll see that there, AUM is down about $116 million for the quarter. Dominic James Addesso : And then, I'm sorry the second follow-on to that, Kai, was? Kai Pan : What are the sort of your \u2013 the investors in Mt. Logan, what's their risk appetite following these events? Dominic James Addesso : We have and have had actually before the events but even after the events, we have investors that are ready to put capital in. Some reload, some new investors that are interested in going forward with the Logan platform, all with an expectation that rates are going up. That kind of relates back to my earlier response to Elyse. Kai Pan : Okay. My second question is that [ph] you sit at about (39:48) 10% of your reinsurance premiums, about 20% of your insurance premiums. I just wonder if the retro or reinsurance rates going up [ph] some (39:56) double-digits, how would that impact your sort of underwriting strategy [ph] in term of net growth (40:02)? Dominic James Addesso : John? John Doucette : Good morning, Kai. It's John. So, I think there's a lot of dials that we look at both in terms of absolute and relative rate adequacy. So, we'll look at it both on the growth side in terms of how we're going to deploy the capital to which area, which product line, which territory, and then how much we want to deploy. So, how much we want to deploy and how much we want to retain, that will be a function of what we think would be overall rate adequacy is. And then, yes, we will look to the different hedges whether it's additional hedges of reinsurance and retro. But remember, we have a lot of dials to turn on how we get the business, as I mentioned, from insurance, reinsurance, all the way to retro. And we have a lot of different dials to turn in terms of how we manage our net risk appetite and net risk exposure. And those include Mt. Logan that takes shares of different pools of risk and stand with Everest on whatever the rates are that we get, and as well as the catastrophe bonds that we have where we have $2.8 billion of multi-year aggregate catastrophe bond, most of which [indiscernible] (41:27) vast majority of that is still intact going forward into January 1 and later. Dominic James Addesso : To add to that, to pick up on something that John has alluded to there, keep in mind that what we have been doing through the market cycle here is the market had been softening over the past couple of years, we've been moving attachment points, and deploying our capital to where we felt was the best risk-adjusted returns. And where we will be going forward, perhaps we'll be changing that again so that where the market is getting the appropriate rate increase and where the best risk-adjusted returns are is where we will be deploying our capital. So, that could change over the next 12 months. Kai Pan : Okay. If I may, the last question is a quick one on the tax rates. So, what's the expected tax rate for the first quarter, will it be normalized like 11%, 12%? Dominic James Addesso : I mentioned in my script, Kai that I believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter, any income earned in the fourth quarter should be at an effective rate of about 10%. Kai Pan : Great. Well, thank you so much. Dominic James Addesso : Thank you, Kai. Operator : We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thanks very much. I know you mentioned the view that the third quarter catastrophe losses were within your risk parameters. Was there anything coming out of your after \u2013 accident reports in the third quarter that ever possibly could have done different or better, looking back on these catastrophe losses? Dominic James Addesso : There is always things around the edges that you can improve upon. There's nothing material, but stands out. I guess in the very extreme and the absurd, could have been no property cat. That's obviously not a realistic scenario. I have to be honest with you, I think what we have done and the way we've managed our portfolio I think has been pretty much spot on, as again during the \u2013 over the last couple of years, as you know, we've been earning very, very good returns on our capital. We've been leveraging the retro market, the capital markets, and allowed us to maintain our writings while not diminishing our returns on capital. And the loss, frankly, has come out well within our parameters. So, there's not really \u2013 I suppose the only other thing that we could have done is again Monday morning quarterback, buy more reinsurance for our insurance portfolio. But looking at it from this vantage point, I'm certain we would make the same decisions. Jay Gelb : Thanks, Dom. And using that is kind of as a starting point for the next question. The combined \u2013 [ph] the account of your (44:50) combined ratio in the third quarter in the insurance business, over 140%, is \u2013 what can be done differently there to bring this to obviously not in 2017, but in 2018 and beyond, bring this to a calendar year underwriting profit for the business? Dominic James Addesso : Well, I mean that combined ratio that you cite includes the catastrophe losses. So, are you talking attritional, are you talking all-in? Jay Gelb : All-in. I mean, looking out into next year, it's been a number of years I think since the insurance business has generated underwriting profit. Dominic James Addesso : Well, on an attritional basis, it is generating an underwriting profit and we see the improvement in the attritional combined ratio year-over-year. So, we are moving in the proper direction. We view our cat book, we view on a corporate or global basis. So, when we are allocating capacity, when we're looking at the marketplace, we're looking at our cat exposure globally and I should say corporately. So, that was well within our risk appetite. To the extent that it is, then we could certainly entertain some intercompany reinsurance opportunities that would, in effect, manage that combined ratio perhaps to the point that you're describing. But overall, we are very confident and very pleased with the attritional performance of our book. Jay Gelb : That's helpful. And then two final quick ones. One, any perspectives on exposure in the fourth quarter from the California wildfires? And then separately, since the company is more focused on deploying capital in the business, should we kind of zero out the potential for share buybacks going into next year? Dominic James Addesso : As you know, we don't \u2013 let me answer the wildfire question first. At this point, it's fairly still early, but the losses we've modeled it and what we're hearing from customers and underwriters is that it is well within our normal quarterly cat load. So, we're not concerned about that event at least at this point. Relative to share buybacks, as you know, we don't give an indication of what our appetite is. We are in the process of just reformulating, if you will, our plans for next year and we'll have perhaps more to say on that in the weeks and months ahead. Jay Gelb : Appreciate it. Thank you. Dominic James Addesso : Thank you, Jay. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Yes. Good morning, everybody. Dominic James Addesso : Good morning, Josh. Josh Shanker : So, I want to square if talks about improving pricing was also your appetite for growth. Compared to many of your peers, you have found opportunities in this marketplace where others haven't and you grew very nicely in this third quarter as well. If someone says look, if there's attractive opportunities, prices maybe doesn't need to go up or how do I square those two things? Dominic James Addesso : Well, is your question on the reinsurance front or the insurance front? Josh Shanker : Well, you can [ph] talk both (48:13) I mean, clearly, the insurance book is obviously growing faster, but you're also finding I guess in financial lines, you found opportunities in reinsurance which is obviously not property. But there's a lot of \u2013 not just you [indiscernible] (48:27) pricing has to go up. But here's Everest and I respect your work and whatnot, and you guys are finding opportunities very helpfully, I think, or maybe I'm not reading it correctly. Dominic James Addesso : No. So, in part, the reinsurance growth is \u2013 remember we took on a crop reinsurance portfolio, so the growth is coming from that. Mortgage has been growing as well. And then, few property \u2013 or few pro-rata deals have added to that as well. And some our structured products there, our structured solutions group has been adding some premium as well. Our straight up property cat business has not really grown all that much year-over-year and that's frankly because of softening market, moving attachment points, all those things in the mix have kind of capped out kind of our appetite on property risk, cat risk. Josh Shanker : Yes. Yes. Dominic James Addesso : Does that \u2013 I don't know if that... Josh Shanker : And so, as you're adding on business in the primary insurance book, is that business dependent on the industry having cheap reinsurance on the property side to allow you to grow there? Dominic James Addesso : Absolutely not. And as Jonathan pointed out in his opening comments, we expect the non-property lines actually to grow a little faster in the coming quarters. So, you'll see even a better balance between property and non-property. Josh Shanker : And, okay, I will try and dig a little deeper on that. The other question, obviously you guys bought more protection throughout the year, lowering your PMLs, but we never really got any numbers to that. Is there any color you can give us on where your PMLs stand now versus where they stood at the beginning of this year? John Doucette : Josh, it's John. Yeah. I mean, I think they were basically materially similar. There was a decrease due to the cat bonds that we issued in the March and April time period. But part of that, and we continue to use third party capital as a way to think about managing our portfolio, managing the overall risk appetite, shaping it. And so to the extent that we had some additional capacity through the aggregate catastrophe bonds that we purchased that covered Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico among other areas, that helped us in terms of then as we went into June 1 and July 1 in terms of the renewal period to maintain a net PML position that we were comfortable with. Josh Shanker : Okay. Well thank you for all the color and good luck with this renewal season. Dominic James Addesso : Thank you, Josh. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning, and thanks for the questions. Just two questions. The first question is the discussion on the catastrophe bonds, and I think what I heard was they didn't kick in. Can you remind us, and I know they all have different attachment points, what do the industrial losses need to get to for your cat bonds to trigger? John Doucette : Good morning. So the catastrophe bonds, some of them we purchased, so across the $2.8 billion there was several layers, different [ph] parallel (52:14) covers. They all cover North America in some fashion and Puerto Rico, several of them. And then some of them are on an occurrence basis and including the most recent $1.25 billion as well as some of the previous ones are on an aggregate basis. So these bonds that we purchased are typically done tied to industry losses, and then there is different market shares that are applied as per the bond. There are different market shares based on territories that are exposed, so there's not really a simple answer to that question. So the market shares in each of the bonds in each of the territories will vary as we try to shape the bond to then best hedge our overall portfolio. So the most latest catastrophe bonds of the $1.25 billion that we issued, they are done on an industry basis so people such as yourself can do your own research on whether you think they're expected to be penetrated or not. There had been some markdowns in the bonds that reflected that there may be some potential penetration to the lowest layer, but that really is going to end up being ultimately up to what the final industry losses are going to be. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's a fair point. Yeah, it's a bit tough to figure out with the weighted index attachment. The second question I had was, I guess, a discussion on the missing industry losses, and we've sort of raised this topic on other calls as to how do we get to the industry loss of $100 billion-plus versus the current addition of the disclosed losses. If the industry loss were to move downwards, does your net loss move up? Can you just help us understand that metric a bit better? Dominic James Addesso : No. As the industry loss moves down, you're expecting our loss to go up? Is that what you asked? Amit Kumar : No, I was thinking about the recoveries, at what level they trigger in. That's what I was asking, sorry. Dominic James Addesso : Our net loss contemplates recoveries from the various instruments that John has just kind of outlined. Which does mean that if the industry loss goes down, our net loss position really doesn't change a whole heck of a lot. Amit Kumar : Got it. Dominic James Addesso : There is some movement that could occur, but it all depends on industry loss, where the loss is coming from, what the weightings are. So it's a little difficult to give a precise answer to that, but my point is that there shouldn't be \u2013 within a band, our net loss position doesn't change a whole heck of a lot. It's really... Amit Kumar : And, Dom, just to your point... John Doucette : And staying on the other side, which is if the losses go up because of the various protections, including the aggregate catastrophe bonds I was just talking about which are very close to the aggregate retention being exhausted or slightly into the first layer, it also means that if the industry losses go up then our net loss position won't change materially. Amit Kumar : Fair point. And Dom, any view on this, I guess, the missing billions of industry losses. I mean, obviously we're talking about rate firming. You're quite positive on the market scenario. [indiscernible] (56:06)... Dominic James Addesso : Now all you smart folks have been exploring this and asking managements on all the calls and have been looking at it for weeks and you can't find it, I don't know how you expect us, a simple man like me to figure that out for you. But if there was a place to look, I would look in the capital markets piece. That's my expectation of where kind of the missing numbers are. Amit Kumar : Yeah, that's a fair point. That's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Dominic James Addesso : Thank you, Amit. Operator : We'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I had to two big picture questions and then one more number-specific. So Dom, I was wondering, one, if you could give us a sense of third party investor elasticity, in other words how various levels of rate changes might affect the supply of third party capital And secondly, whether based on your experience it makes sense to hold back some capital from 1/1 renewals in anticipation of better rate changes later in 2018? Dominic James Addesso : Two great questions. Third party capital is looking to come back into the space where what I would call reload if it can get meaningful rate increases, and the definition of meaningful can vary by company, it can vary by investor. Do I see a material increase in third party capital if we have some level of market firming? I do not. I think first, the capital has to be reloaded, and I think what your question was implying was is the third party capital going to increase materially if there is some material increase in pricing. We don't see that just yet. I also think that the other side of the equation is that, and what we've heard from some clients, is that they're more interested in potentially increasing their purchases from rated paper as opposed to third party capital. The whole issue of reinstates are always a problem there, and so there does seem to be an increased interest in rated paper. Now, that doesn't mean by the way that reinsurers like ourselves, which utilize third party capital and see it as an opportunity to expand our capital base, wouldn't increase. But to the extent that it does allow reinsurers to perhaps increase the participations of clients directly as opposed to have those clients buy from third party capital, we think that might represent an opportunity certainly in the medium-term. In terms of holding back capital, we're in a marketplace. We have customers and we have sufficient capital and/or access to capital that, well, we can trade forward or trade in a bigger way if rates are even firming more into the year. I think that the fundamental question is we won't be deploying capital unless it meets our risk-adjusted return hurdles, so that's the first test. And if it meets our hurdles, and we would anticipate it would probably even, in some circumstances, exceed our hurdles, then we would deploy the capital, and there isn't a need to hold back capital in that regard. Does that answer your two questions? Meyer Shields : It does, certainly well. Thank you. Follow-up, or not follow-up, but within the insurance segment, I guess, both last year and this year the attritional loss ratio was higher in the third quarter than it was in the preceding two. And I was wondering is there some element to seasonality or is that just a lucky draw? Dominic James Addesso : In any one particular quarter, there's adjustments we're making to pick loss ratios. Our A&H book of business for example has been growing which, by definition, carries a little bit higher attritional loss ratio. We think it's more appropriate to look at the year-to-date performance since it takes out some of those quarterly anomalies which makes the business \u2013 where we're pegging loss ratios in any one particular quarter, we make adjustments in a quarter. But it's the year-to-date number that really is what we think and what we look at predominantly, and that's improving year-over-year. That's trending in the right manner. Meyer Shields : Yeah. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Meyer Shields : Thank you, Meyer. Operator : And we'll go to our final question from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you, Dom. The first, I'm just curious. At Mt. Logan, how much collateral do you expect to be tied up at the 1/1 renewals and do you plan on kind of replenishing that with new money here on that? Dominic James Addesso : Do it, John. John Doucette : Yeah. It's John. So the amount that would be tied up would be consistent with the expected losses that are there plus a buffer that would be on top of that against the ceded losses. And then in terms of how much we would look to raise or redeploy, we're in the process of talking to Logan investors, both existing and new ones, and we would expect \u2013 we don't know what the final number will be, but we would expect it to be up. Brian Meredith : Got you. Dominic James Addesso : And those investors, to make it clear, are looking also for rates to be up, and they're not looking to deploy capital in a flat to down market. John Doucette : Right. And it allows, as Dom said earlier, there clearly is a trend in the buyers both in the reinsurance and retro market looking for rated paper because there are some fundamental structural problems which we're going to see it's going to play out in real time because with the collateralized products. In terms of collateral release mechanisms, forced collateral release, people may realize they thought they had cover and then they don't have as much cover as they thought or they don't have continuity of cover from one year to the next as collateral gets trapped. So there's a clear demand for rated paper. And with our balance sheet, our ratings, and kind of our 45-year trading relationship with clients the around the world, expect to be in a good position to capitalize on that. And so part of that would be to make sure that we get the right net risk position to be able to use our different capital structures, such as Mt. Logan, to help. But basically, if Everest gets raised, the Mt. Logan investors will benefit from that, so we stand pari passu with them. Brian Meredith : Right. That's great. And then I'm just curious. Given history has kind of shown that on the property cat line rate increases tend to be fairly short-lived. Not sure if you expect that this time around. But given that, would you expect to potentially disproportionally put more into Mt. Logan or some type of a soft capital facility to kind of help manage that risk? Dominic James Addesso : I think, we have demonstrated over the last couple of years that we deploy our capital in the best risk-adjusted areas. We have used third party capital. We will write the business on the basis that we think is best for the organization and use the capital that's out there in the most highly efficient manner possible. So it's difficult to answer that question precisely, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're flexible and we tend to be within ranges, opportunistic, and we move our capacity around. And we will continue to do that as we trade forward if what you're suggesting is that the firming would be short-lived. Brian Meredith : Great. That's great. And then one last one. I'm just curious. So John and Dom, I appreciate your point about the industry, kind of cost of capital going up here. But do you think that the kind of cost to goods sold for property cat reinsurance based upon models and stuff is also going to rise here and it's going to drive some of this rate activity or do you not see that happening? Dominic James Addesso : I'll ask John to address that. John Doucette : Yeah. So I think a lot of times \u2013 every time a loss happens there's always something that the different vendors learn from, something different than before and they adjust it. That typically takes a few years to ripple through the system as they update their models to kind of fit the historical events set or the different events that happen. So certainly, I think take what happened in Houston, I think there's going to be a heightened awareness to flooding risk in different ways than people. Certainly, some of the vendor models had thought about it before. But this is true with the different earthquakes, whether it was the New Zealand earthquake or the four zones on the Japanese earthquake. It's been a long time since a catastrophe of that size hit, Maria, and I think the modeling agencies will think that through. And for a little while there, we were looking at a Cat 5 hitting Miami, and I think that will both change some customers' views of their risk management as well as potentially change some of the vendor models with that as they think about the possibilities with the different storm tracks. But a lot of that takes a \u2013 the customer views may be more \u2013 happen in real time as people think about what board of directors for some of our clients think about what their risk position is and how much they want to keep net, and that may put some upward demand on reinsurance. But in terms of the modeling agencies, it usually takes a little bit to go through the system. Brian Meredith : Great. And then... Dominic James Addesso : Bottom line, Brian, I think the models are great. Everyone in the industry uses them. Events like this I think caused all managements to take them with a little bit of grain of salt and recognize that there is risk that is not evidenced through the models, and that in fact will have some impact on pricing, will have some impact on buying behavior as well. Brian Meredith : Great. And then kind of just one quick numbers question for Craig, let him do some talking here. In the operating expense line, was there any kind of reversal of maybe variable incentive comp that happened? Craig Howie : Yes. We did that this quarter as well, Brian, just because of a matching with the events. But that'll be determined again in the fourth quarter depending on where we stand with respect to income in the fourth quarter. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Brian Meredith : I'm glad Craig was able to be able to respond. Craig Howie : That's right. Dominic James Addesso : That's it. Okay. So we've had all our questions, and thanks for those. In summary, I think what you heard this morning is that our risk management practices have contained the losses within our expectations, and that kind of permits us to trade forward and participate fully in what we believe, and I think the market believes, there will be firming. We think this is true not only because of what markets in general are saying but also because there will be some dislocation of capital which, as I said before, will benefit highly rated papers such as ours. So this is the business we're in but this does create some opportunity for us going forward. Well thank you for your participation on the call and I look forward to our continued dialog. Happy Halloween. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call of Everest Re Group. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Farrell : Thank you, Derrick. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of the Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dom Addesso : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, and welcome to the meeting this morning. We are pleased that we\u2019re able to report to you today an excellent fourth quarter result. This of course comes during the year that experienced a record level of catastrophe losses for the industry. It is noteworthy that despite this level of losses, we were able to report a profit for the full year and an ROE of 6% on the strength of the fourth quarter. This level of performance for the year demonstrates the ability of our platform to sustain periodic events and yet maintain an above average industry return through the cycle. Our value proposition and risk management has positioned us to succeed. No doubt there'll be questions today and beyond about rates, competition, return of capital, and acquisitions. And while we've readily admit these are certainly the issues of the day, our value proposition is such we continue to build diversification and scale that allows us take advantage of market dynamics. If you've heard from us in the past and will continue to hear from my colleagues today is the success we're having in achieving profitable growth, both the new products and existing ones. We reached a record revenue with over $7 billion in total gross premium written for 2017. In 2017, our reinsurance portfolio grew 20% with much of that growth in lines other than U.S. property cap. Crop, casualty, non U.S. property, mortgage and other credit related business, all exhibited meaningful growth during the year. The U.S. cap business grew in part due to reinstatement premiums and back up coverage, and true growth is offset by sessions to cat bonds and Mt. Logan. Therefore, there was no material change to speak of in our PML exposure relative to cap. All this points to a reinsurance portfolio that is becoming more diversified each and every year, thereby providing earnings resiliency with an attritional combined ratio of 81%, which was stable year-over-year. Further in this diversification is the continued growth in our insurance business to over $2 billion or 15% for the year and 32% for the year adjusting for the sale of our crop company. More important than the growth was the continuing improvement in our attritional combined ratio as we expected. And due to legacy issue coming under control, we have reserve releases come through in the fourth quarter. Those profit and growth trends are quite encouraging and ones that we expect will continue. Tribute to a great that has executed and capitalized on the brand, scope, scale and financial strength of the franchise. Another contributor to results for the year was our growth and investment income of 15%. Certainly, asset growth is a factor but the larger contribution came from the asset allocation decisions made during the year without meaningfully changing our duration or risk profile. Combination of strong investment results coupled with our underlying results on an after tax basis resulted in $375 million of operating profit, which given the weather events during the year we believe is an outstanding result. Book value per share rose by 4%, reflecting in part the return of capital to our shareholders both through dividends and share repurchases. So as we end the year and move into 2018, I do so with optimism. Our talent, execution and platform have never been better. We have a culture to take on new opportunities and be nimble, which is what the current market dynamics dictate we must have. Our risk appetite is continually evolving based on where the best risk adjusted returns are. Pricing and property lines both in reinsurance and insurance are moving in the right direction. At 1/1, a heavy reinsurance renewal date PMLs in the U.S. reinsurance book in particular are down year-over-year but the absolute margins are up. We expect that to continue. Capital markets are still a factor and likely to continue to grow. However, we do not expect this development to crab us out as opportunities for greater economic growth, privatization of public risk and continued movement towards closing the gap between economic and insured losses with all leads to the needs for greater capacity. Equally encouraging is the casualty space, which has been soft for some time, but is now firming to varying degrees in most lines. This will benefit both our reinsurance and insurance operations. And while the standard lines will benefit from RE, there will also be real growth as more offerings have greater appeal with expanded margins. Furthermore, the insurance team has been the greater upside as we continue to scale our platform. And on the reinsurance side, we will continue to expand our newer product offerings, which will further diversify our portfolio. These are all factors which we feel will contribute to growing success into 2018 and beyond. Now, I will turn it over to my colleagues for further details about our results and our journey. Thank you. And first to Craig for the financial report. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had net income of $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 with the strong underline performance, aided by reserve releases that impacted both current and prior years. This compares to net income of $374 million dollars for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the year was $469 million compared to $996 million in 2016. After tax operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $556 million compared to $363 million in 2016. Operating loss excludes realized capital gains and losses and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the year, operating income was $375 million compared to $993 million in 2016. The primary difference was higher catastrophe losses in 2017. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $184 million of gross current year catastrophe losses related to the California wildfire. Net of reinsurance, the current quarter catastrophe losses amounted to $162 million. We lowered our pretax estimates for the third quarter of 2017 catastrophe events by about $100 million. This was primarily related to reductions for the earthquake in Mexico and the third quarter Hurricane. The fourth quarter of 2017 also included $30 million of favorable development on prior year cap losses, largely from the 2016 year. Therefore, net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $29 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion in 2017 compared to $301 million in 2016. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85% for the year, down from 85.5% last year. On reserves, we completed our annual loss reserve study. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves remained adequate. In the fourth quarter, we booked $262 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This included favorable prior period development for both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segment. The insurance segment reported $65 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers\u2019 compensation business. The reinsurance segments reported $197 million of favorable prior year development, reflecting $234 million of favorable development, partially offset by a $37 million increase in the asbestos reserves to replenish our position at the beginning of the year. The $234 million of reinsurance favorable development during the quarter related to casualty and property business, both in the United States and internationally. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $149 million for the quarter and $543 million for the year on our $18.6 billion investment portfolio. Investment income for the year was up 15% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $45 million over 2016. We've been able to maintain investment yield without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. However, we have gradually shifted allocations within our alternative investment bucket by reducing exposure for high yield debt and public equity, while committing more towards limited partnership investments. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% and duration remained at just over three years. Other income and expense included $25 million of foreign exchange losses for the 2017 year compared to $21 million of foreign exchange losses in 2016. Other income and expense also included $7 million loss from Mt. Logan Re for the year 2017 compared to $11 million of earnings and fees in 2016. The decline essentially represents the higher level of catastrophe losses in 2017. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and the geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes this year, and the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a tax charge of $8 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This tax charge primarily related to the change in the corporate tax rate acquired for the company's net deferred tax assets. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of 2017, up $294 million or 3.6% over year end 2016. This is after taking into account capital return through $50 million of share buybacks and $207 million of dividends paid in 2017. The company announced a 4% increase to its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our strong capital balance leaves us well positioned for business opportunities. Thank you. And now, John Doucette, will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Our operating team is following the 2017 catastrophes and the January 1st renewals are resilient, adaptability and partnership. Resilience is valued by our investors and is expected by our clients who depend on our financial security, and they rely on our evergreen promise-to-pay claims, especially in times of need. Everest has faithfully kept its promise for the last 45 years, through years with extreme industry losses such as 2017. Both sides of our balance sheet are built to withstand shock losses whether from actual 2017 cat events or worse hypothetical losses had Hurricane Irma directly hit Miami as a cat five. Supporting our strong conservative capital position on balance sheet, many levels of hedges protect our capital and our promise to our clients. This includes $2.8 billion of unexhausted catastrophe bonds and over $1 billion deployed in Mt. Logan, further protecting us from even more extreme events than seen in 2017. Following several major catastrophes in Q3, we are pleased with the strong profitability generated by our reinsurance book in the fourth quarter, and the overall results for 2017. In Q4, reinsurance generated $419 million of underwriting profit; $197 million from favorable prior year development offset by $33 million in net catastrophe losses this quarter. For Q4, California wildfire losses were $156 million, offset by releases on prior period catastrophes, including Q3 caps. For 2017, reinsurance withstood $1.3 billion of pre-tax net catastrophe losses. Our 2017 combined ratio was 103%, including 29 points of cat losses, highlighting our robust underwriting strategy, broadly diversified portfolio and strong risk management. Excluding cats, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year development, our attritional combined ratio remained flat at 81%. Globally, Q4 gross written premium increased 21% from backup covers and new capital relief quota shares and some multiline deals. For 2017, reinsurance premium was up 20% to $5.1 billion with increased writings in property, crop, financial line and mortgage. Now, for some color on 2017 by segment. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, 2017 premium was up 22% to $2.6 billion from increased property writings, reinstatement premiums, back-up covers, increases in property quota shares crop and mortgage. This segment produced $30 million in underwriting profit for 2017 despite $700 million of catastrophe losses. The 2017 combined ratio was up 22 points, driven by the cats while the attritional combined ratio was relatively flat at 78.1%. For our international segment, 2017 premium was $1.3 billion, up 7% with growth in several regions, but only up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For 2017, cat losses were about $450 million, resulting in an underwriting loss. However, the attritional combined ratio was down about 2 points due to a lower commission ratio and higher property excessive loss writings. In our Bermuda segment, 2017 premium was $1.2 billion, up 35% with growth from new structured multiline reinsurance and increased financial lines deals. The 2017 combined ratio increased by 11 points to 98.5% from higher cats but the attritional combined ratio increased modestly to 89.5%. As with any major disruption, opportunity follows for those well positioned for post loss execution, and that was true for us this renewal. During this pivotal 1/1 renewal season, there were several disruptive contravening forces; one, large losses that impacted earnings or capital of clients, reinsurers and non-traditional participants; two, a new market sensitivity to risk, impacting managements and boards of both buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 views on pricing, accumulations, tail exposure and ERM; three, significant amounts of trapped capital and reloading of some of that alternative capital; four, across all lines of business, large clients, reevaluation of their ceded reinsurance strategies and in several cases, increased renewal sessions or placement of new treaties across several lines; and five, governments and other economic risk holders de-risking and bringing new exposures to the reinsurance market. With all of these market forces, 1/1 was complex as the market tried to decide what it was and what it wanted to be; a purely capital markets transactional marketplace with staggering velocity of capital formation or a market of longstanding reinsurance relationships between buyers and sellers that understand each other; valued continuity of trading relationships and agreed at rates need to go up after a loss. In the end, it was somewhere in between. Although, the market rebound was less pronounced than in past truly hard markets, many clients realized after several years of rate decreases and meaningful industry losses, rates must increase. While the rate movement overall was less than originally expected, we are pleased with the ultimate outcome of our 1/1 portfolio. At January 1st, our underwriting discipline and market leadership manifested in improved risk adjusted returns, significantly above the market average. We re-underwrote several accounts, achieved rates in loss affected areas and in most lines around the globe, increased shares on deals and layers we liked. And also wrote several new opportunities with our core clients. Short tail business, retro and loss effective property cat treaties achieved increases well into the double-digits. But we also re-under wrote portions of our property book and declines many deals with unacceptable economic terms, then reallocated that property capacity to core clients and better opportunities around the globe. The casualty market, which was a bright spot in this renewal, showed some stabilization and improvement. Ceding commissions decreased a few points and excess loss rates had mid-single digit improvements with differentiation between better and worst performing books. We capitalized on our franchise and long-standing client and broker relationships. We wrote a number of deals with better than market terms. And other times, we were one of only three or four reinsurers approached to solve the client's needs. These highlight our superior access to business and reinsurance opportunities, particularly global clients seek meeting global reinsurers, such as Everest, for solutions across all lines of business. And as a result, we were able to meaningfully expand our relationships with them, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2018. Our empowered underwriters excel as nimble, creative reinsurance experts in their local markets, listening to and understanding their clients' needs. Our clients and brokers benefit from the direct interaction with the decision makers in our decentralized model to access risk. This is done while adhering to a consistent global view of risk across all underwriters within every Everest division, including insurance and Lloyd\u2019s. In the end, our 1/1 renewal was successful. Our premium is up by several hundred million dollars, this January 1st compared to last January 1st. And our combined ratios are lower and our expected profits are higher in 2018. The reloading of some alternative capital, in addition to competition from traditional players, had a muting impact on January 1st renewals, highlighting that alternative capital has become and enduring reality. While this threatened some traditional business models, Everest is successfully addressing these challenges by utilizing alternative capital to leverage opportunity, best match capital to risk and ultimately benefit Everest shareholders. Recognizing the market evolution between historical reinsurance trading relationships and new capital markets innovation, Everest strategic repositioning has been well under way for several years. We continue to further develop our robust risk and capital management infrastructure while adapting our strategies to capitalize on market changes. With our relevance as the leading global reinsurer, strong portfolio diversification across property and casualty lines around the globe, best-in-class expense ratio, industry leading earnings power and approximately $13 billion of capital resources through equity, traditional debt, Mt. Logan, cat bonds and other hedges, we have a competitive advantage in this dynamic market. In summary, as a resilient, adaptable reinsurer focused on delivering client solutions and building long term partnerships, utilizing efficient capital structures, we remain ideally positioned to successfully navigate the waters of this ever changing market into the future, and look forward to a strong 2018. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jon Zaffino : Thank you, John and good morning. Our global insurance operations finished 2017 on a strong note, in terms of growth and more importantly, profitability in the fourth quarter. As shared in prior calls, we have been consistently executing on a multifaceted strategic plan, encompassing every dimension of our global insurance organization. As measured by our key performance metrics, we have made considerable progress and are pleased with our expanded operating platform and the growing depth and diversity of our associated books of specialty business. 2017 concluded with record levels of gross written premium, the deepest roster of actively underwritten specialty products in our history, 150 and counting, the broadest geographic reach, 17 offices across the U.S., Canada, and Europe for us to execute our business from, and the highest number of insurance teammates across disciplines who are making all this happen. This quarter's 36% growth and 80% combined ratio are further testament to the corrective underwriting actions successfully executed upon over the past several years and our conservative reserving position across the portfolio. At $2.1 billion and 2017 gross written premium, Everest Insurance is maturing as the global specialty underwriting platform we had envisioned at the onset. And it's firmly positioned within the top 10 of the global lead table for specialty insurance carriers. We remain encouraged about our growing opportunity set globally and look forward to the many opportunities ahead of us in 2018. Turning to the financial results. The global insurance operations produced a record $575 million in gross written premium in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is an increase of $153 million or 36% over fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter growth profile is generally consistent with our experience over the last several quarters as the addition of dozens of new products and the many talented underwriters managing their thoughtful growth continue to make their impact. As mentioned, year-to-date we achieved $2.1 billion in gross written premium, again another record performance. This represents growth of $272 million or 15% over 2016. A significant percentage of this growth is emanating from new businesses and products incepted over the past three years, inclusive of our increasingly relevant Lloyd\u2019s operation, which eclipsed $100 million in gross written premium in 2017. Each of these products chosen for particular risk return characteristics is playing an increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio. Our net written premiums in the quarter are $451 million and $1.6 billion for 2017, which represent increases of 33% and 18% respectively over the prior year period. Net earned premium in the quarter increased by $73 million or 22% to $398 million. For the year-to-date period, net earned premium of $1.5 billion increased by $170 million or 13% over 2016. Each of these are record highs for the insurance operations and provide a solid foundation for growth into 2018. The GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 80.4%, benefited from 16 points of favorable prior year development, which I will discuss later on in my remarks. For the full year, the GAAP combined ratio was 104.8, which included 12 points or just over a $170 million of previously disclosed cat losses across our global portfolio emanating mainly from the hurricane activity in the third quarter along with the minor contribution from the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. The attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter improved to 97.8% from the 99.9% experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 2.1 improvement. Year-to-date, the attritional combined also improved 2.4 points from 99.3% in 2016 and 96.9% in 2017. The attritional combined ratio continues to improve as a result of the many underwriting initiatives instituted in recent years. While improving year-over-year, we anticipate an additional level of improvement around 2 points or so over 2018 as the impact of non-renewed businesses continues to lessen. Turning to the attritional loss and loss expense ratio for the fourth quarter. The global insurance operations produced 67.1%, which has slightly improved from the 67.5% experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. This quarter's results also improved by nearly a point from the third quarter attritional of 68.4%. Year-to-date, the attritional loss and loss expense ratio also improved nearly 3 points to 67% from 69.7% in 2016. This despite nearly 1.4 points of impact from non-cat related convective storm activity experienced in the year. So again, we continue to see the steady and continued downward drift in the attritional loss ratio as a result of the strategic underwriting actions implemented over the past three years, improved mix of business and benefits from increased scale of our new business launches. As the impact of now divested businesses increases, such as Hartland, we further expect to realize benefit of our newer portfolio. Looking at the expenses, the fourth quarter expense ratio came in at 30.7%, nearly a 2 point improvement in the prior year fourth quarter of 32.4%. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 29.9%, essentially flat with the 29.6% for 2016. And expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. With respect to the favorable reserve development, the conclusion of our customary fourth quarter reserve reviews resulted in fourth quarter releases totaling approximately $65 million from accident years 2013 and prior. Our workers compensation book predominantly concentrated in California contributed materially to this as it has been developing favorably for some time. On a year-to-date basis, favorable prior period development equates to $56 million. We remain confident in our overall reserve position across the insurance portfolio, particularly in light of reserve actions taken over the last several years. Turning to the operating environment. Overall, rate trends experienced from the first three quarters gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the property line. Excluding our workers\u2019 compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall rate change for the North American P&C insurance operations where the overwhelming majority of our renewal book resides, ended 2017 at plus 1%. While only slightly positive, it is the first time in several years that we have experienced position aggregate rates in the non-workers\u2019 compensation lines of business. Inclusive of the workers\u2019 compensation portfolio, the overall rate change turned slightly negative to minus 3%, indicating the continued mid single-digit rate pressure across the work comp line. This outcome was fully anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year. Further, we have experienced a material improvement in our property portfolio in the third and fourth quarters where rates moved from essentially flat to plus 3% and plus 8% in 3Q and 4Q respectively. As many of you know, the heavier cat exposed wholesale books of business and meaningful part of our property book renew in the first and second quarter of 2018 thus we have yet to see the rate influence from these renewals. Additionally, the commercial auto segment of our portfolio continues to receive corrective rate actions, a trend that's now persisted for several quarters. Overall, we achieved meaningful positive rate across this book in 2017, delivering plus 12%. As with the general liability markets, primary and excess, we also achieved positive rate in fourth quarter. Although, roughly flat for the year, there're signs that this market continue to stabilize and positive rate movement is expected. Overall, across our portfolio, we anticipate moderately improved operating condition throughout 2018 with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of further corrective rate action. We will continue to focus our efforts and resources on those areas and lines of business that presented with appropriate risk adjusted returns. In conclusion, we are pleased and encouraged by our 2017 results. Despite a difficult cat year, the progress we have made organically build a top 10 global specialty insurer is encouraging deeply motivating to our colleagues. Our enforced book of business has meaningfully improved on an underlying basis and we anticipate increased resilience in our portfolio as our growth and diversification strategies continue building traction. Our platform and growing range of capabilities are well positioned for future growth. The Everest insurance brand is strong and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls. Now, back to Beth for Q&A. Elizabeth Farrell : Thanks, Jon. Derrick, we are now open for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : My first question in terms of the PML disclosure, at the top of the call, you guys mentioned that your PMLs went down in U.S. reinsurance. Is this after reinstatement and taxes? I know you guys disclosed to PML figures? Craig Howie : Elyse this is Craig. Yes, that would be the same basis that we typically disclosed our PMLs on a net economic basis, so it would be after reinstatement and after taxes. We do expect them to stay in relation to our overall capital. We expect them to stay relatively flat or even slightly down. Elyse Greenspan : So then as we're thinking about the impact of tax reform and what that could have had done to your PML, to keep your net PMLs, to get your net PMLs to go down. Was there more retro that you were purchasing if you can just talk to I guess how you changed on your PMLs following on tax reform? Craig Howie : After tax reform, as you know, the tax rate will go down. So the tax benefit for some of the longer bill depends on the return period. So the longer return periods will get less tax benefit, but we can cover that with other types of reinsurance purchases and lower catastrophe loss. Dom Addesso : And also, Elyse, what we said was that our PML relative to capital about stable, so we were suggesting that the PML would go down necessarily, which is relative to capital it would be about similar position. Elyse Greenspan : And then sticking with taxes for a second. How should we think about your tax rate as we think about modeling in 2018? Dom Addesso : So overall with the tax rate coming down in the United States, as you know, we do business globally around the world in many different jurisdictions. But with the tax rate coming down in the U.S., we expect our overall tax rate to come down about a couple of points. Elyse Greenspan : And then as we think about your outlook for the market for the balance of the year, you guys obviously reloaded Logan, your own alternative capital vehicle to a level well in excess of where it\u2019s at last year, so more than covering of the losses. How do you view the impact I guess, so it's a two part question of both alternative capital as well as we see more of the insured losses for the third quarter events come down. How do you think that that can have an impact on the market as we think to the June and July renewals? Dom Addesso : I still think that we feel the market was trending up in the property space, particularly those areas that have been loss affected. And we\u2019re not anticipating perhaps the alternative capital of having some impact on wild swings in rates but generally markets are seeking some level of rate increase in those loss effective areas, and frankly they deserve it. So we do not expect the reloading of alternative capital if it is even reloaded entirely to impact or to have a rate decrease effect. Elyse Greenspan : And then one last question, you mentioned I believe that some multiyear coverage written in the fourth quarter. How bigger or multiyear coverage in proportion to your reinsurance book? John Doucette : That's one of the things we did net incrementally accounted for some of the premium, I mean across the entire $5 billion on premium, it's not that material. It does -- it's in different classes of business, credit, mortgage and different lines of business, there is a couple of property deals. But overall, it's not a very meaningful part of our book. Operator : Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : First question just follow-up on the January renewal, John mentioned that you guys had improved your risk adjusted returns above the market. Could you quantify that just in terms of how much do you see the market increase versus yours? And how the market would -- dynamics would play out at New Year renewals, is that -- would that rate increase sustain or improve in the coming renewals? John Doucette : So there's a lot of moving parts. And I don't know that we know exactly what happened with the market. There's a lot of deals that are done in the market that we declined, and we don't know what the ultimate price that they were done at. And I think that's one of the ways that we get better than market results is that we maintain our underwriting discipline on deals that we don't agree with the absolute rate or don't agree with the rate increase or flat or decrease given the loss positions or the overall market condition. So it's hard for us to quantify that, but we are comfortable that we are building a better overall portfolio that exists in the market given our ratings, our global footprint, our very broad diversified portfolio, frankly our fantastic underwriters around the globe. And I think that just helps us. And as I mentioned, it helps us build relationships as we continue, we are and continue to be relevant to many of our trading partners. And one of the interesting things this January 1st is we saw across a whole lot of operations, our Bermuda, our London, Zurich, Canada, Miami, U.S., we saw many clients increasing their participation with us and that's across a lot of different lines of business. So that's probably the most -- one of the most optimistic things we saw is just the increase in demand for reinsurance, particularly with Everest. So we're very pleased with that. Again, Dom alluded to the mid-year renewals we don't know what it's going to be. We think given the rate decreases that have happened and the losses, there should be upward pressure on rates, but we don't forecast what we think it'll be. We are confident that we'll be able to execute irrespective of what the market conditions are. Kai Pan : My second question -- If you look at your fourth quarter, especially insurance segment, that's the first meaningful release in more than a decade. So just wonder if you can give a more detail regarding to how much of that -- how much the legacy book developed, what accident year those workers\u2019 comp release has been. And going forward, given you guys since 2010 has instituted more conservative reserve for last year. Will we see more reserve releases in the coming years? Dom Addesso : I'm going to let Craig get to the specifics for that. But first let me say that you're correct and that we haven't had an overall net reserve release in insurance for quite some time. But let me highlight the fact that it has been due to our legacy portfolio and we have had net reserve releases in varying lines of business in the insurance book, it\u2019s just that on the net basis, they haven't come through because they\u2019ve been overwhelmed with the legacy issues, which we now feel we have control of it. I'll let Craig get into some of the more specifics about your question. Craig Howie : It's a good comment, and Dom's comment is correct as well. We didn't see any drag from the prior year run off business in the insurance segment this year. So what you're seeing is the actual results come through on a net basis, you're seeing favorable development. Primarily from as John Zaffino mentioned, it's from 2013 and prior and mostly in the workers\u2019 compensation area but some other small lines as well. So that's the major difference year-over-year, but our process hasn\u2019t change that conservative process that you mentioned since even as early as 2010, remains in effect and we continue to go through that same process each year. We take our time to react to that favorable development and we don\u2019t release those redundancies until they've developed overtime and become more mature. Kai Pan : Last one if I may on the tax rate. You said it will be a reduction about a couple of points. What are the starting points? And are you guys going to change your ceding program, which currently is sitting about 40% of U.S. premiums to offshore affiliates? Craig Howie : So the answer to that, first of all, is the starting point was our 2016 tax rate was about 10% that was last year. This year as you know, we had a tax benefit for the overall year, so that the actual exposure that we had after the catastrophe losses for the year. But we do expect it to be in the high-single digit going forward, that's number one. And your question about what are we doing going forward. We will be cancelling or have canceled our quota share already, because it is not economical for us to do that, going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : First, just want to note that I think that tax rate is lot better than people thought it was going to be. Second on outbound reinsurance and retrocessional protection in 2018. How should we be thinking about Everest strategy on that? John Doucette : So I think we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy have looked at retro from time-to-time, we cede business to Logan, we have the cat bonds, and probably use, et cetera and we continue to look at different capital structures traditional or non-traditional that we\u2019re going to do. I think probably the way I would think about it is look at the metric gross ratios both for insurance and reinsurance over the last couple of years. And those should stay reasonably consistent. We're still in the process as Craig said with the change in the internal quota share. We're still in the process of thinking of PML management, risk management, capital management. And we haven't yet decided on everything we have some ideas. So that may result in the tail we do additional sessions but across the whole portfolio, that won't be that larger percentage. So I think the net to gross ratios that exist today are probably pretty good. Dom Addesso : And part of the answer to that Jay is also that it's a little difficult to give you absolute numbers on that, because it somewhat depends on what we see coming in front door, so if our property business is down or that one strategy if it\u2019s up that might be an entirely different strategy. What we are anticipating though is that our expected capital were go forward into 2018 would be just under 9%, which was about a point drop from where traditional is at. Jay Gelb : Final question is on the merger and acquisition environment and opportunities. So in light of AIG's announced acquisition of Validus all-cash for what can be viewed as a pretty attractive multiple. Does that have any influence on Everest\u2019s thinking in terms of acquisitions going forward or consolidation within the reinsurance market? Dom Addesso : None whatsoever. In fact, I am not sure that we would -- maybe even detract a little bit more from an acquisitions team to the extent that that's the go forward multiple we think that an organic build is a lot more efficient for us. And I think we've demonstrated both on the reinsurance and the insurance side that we've been successful in that strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : I just want to add a little bit on Kai's question about the timing on the reserve releases. Dom, you're I think up to almost nine years at the firm. When you came in nine years ago, what did the reserve situation look like? And in terms of your priorities, is there a different timeline on getting the different departments in order or are both the reinsurance and insurance reserving techniques the same and on the same track? Dom Addesso : Well, Josh you have a good memory as to timeline. But when I first came in I think what I said at the time is that I thought we had an adequate reserve position. And I think that\u2019s demonstrated to be accurate. I think if you look through the history at the various accident years, we have developed favorably, so that's number one. Some years develop more favorably than others, but all different. What did change and I did institute some reserving changes when I first came in just the way we established the current accident year number, and that I think frankly through time has proven to be perhaps a bit more conservative than it may have been prior to that. But nevertheless, reserves have developed favorably. And I think it's what we've been able to harvest over the last couple of years, probably is somewhat reflective of a slightly more conservative philosophy than we had in the past. But notwithstanding that again history would prove that our reserves have developed favorably at various accident years. John Doucette : And the second part of that question Josh was the process and the process did the same for both reinsurance and insurance. Josh Shanker : And then in usual with your peers you brought back stock in the fourth quarter. You obviously have a lower debt to capital ratio than everyone else does. Depending on how you view the stock. Why was it the right time, why not buy more, the decision in terms of how much capital you need to raise new business? What's the trade-off between debt financing share repurchase at this point? Can you talk about all the nuts and bolts behind that decision? Dom Addesso : Well first of all, I think that we felt the stock was an enormous value at the time we bought it in. The amount that we bought in was somewhat contained because of how close it was to coming up with numbers as opposed to why it was 50 as opposed to something more. We have to be mindful of the fact that we\u2019re getting closer to the year-end. And relative to our capital position, we were comfortable with where the third quarter events what that meant to our total financial position. So we weren\u2019t particularly concerned about our capital position. And relative to debt-to-equity, what we stated in the past is that we'd like to keep that number conservative because it's a contingency reserve if you will to the extent that we saw an opportunity either despite my preference for organic build. If we did see an acquisition that made some sense that gave us some flexibility and/or if we saw some tremendous market opportunity again it gave us flexibility. So we tend to view the debt capacity as one that's gives us flexibility as opposed to leveraging that made up to the max. Operator : Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : I'm trying to put together a couple of data points. One is the fact that most companies and I think Everest as well has talked about the third quarter catastrophes being in line with modeled expectations instead of having any major surprises. And the second is that we're seeing bigger rate increases on loss affected accounts. Is that a fair observation and is that a rational response or is there -- I'm asking whether there\u2019s an opportunity in there? Dom Addesso : Is what rational response, that there is rate increases on loss affected\u2026. Meyer Shields : Bigger rate increases on loss impacted accounts if that was more luck than a reflection of lower underwriting profitability? Dom Addesso : First of all, the rate increases that have come through the market are probably less than people were anticipating based on other market events of a similar nature. And recognize that the market has been in somewhat of a rate declines for several years. So whether to the extent was it a rational response, even though the losses were as you described as expected, I absolutely think it was a rational response. And I think perhaps closing as rational as it needed to be. But nevertheless, from our perspective, the rate increases get us back to a point where it's a reasonable return relative to the risk we\u2019re taking on. Whereas I think if you look at the results of the industry in last three years in many cases there were many markets that were operating at below the cost of capital. So I absolutely think even though it might have been an expected level of loss, if you\u2019re riding business below your cost of capital then that absolutely is a rational response. Meyer Shields : Is there -- the opportunity I'm wondering, is there an opportunity to target impact -- accounts that were impacted by 2017 catastrophes because rate increases are bigger there than elsewhere? Dom Addesso : Well, that's what we do each and every day, and of course. And there are instances where we think it's the right rate and we\u2019ll increase share. We think it\u2019s the appropriate rate. And in many cases, as we saw 1/1 were instances where we defined or got off the certain businesses, because it was an inappropriate rate relative to the risk. So yes, these events always create opportunities, sometimes the opportunities make sense and other times, they don't. John Doucette : I want to add a little more color to that. I think going back to your first part of your question, I think there's also -- you got to look at it as modeled results and then psychology of the market and also when losses like this have happened. And I am not sure I completely agree that all the -- that it's certainly across the buyers and even some of the sellers that everybody thought these losses were expected. I would highlight California wildfires, largest fires of all time. Houston being impacted by Harvey are one in a thousand event. I am not sure if people think in terms of one in a thousand type event, the flooding that happened there. As you may recall, Irma for a while was heading to Florida, to Miami as a Cat five and looked like it was going to be a direct hit and the market was talking about $150 billion, $200 billion of insured losses. And Maria heading Puerto Rico that was the first major hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. And all of that I think impacts what -- while it could be in a model, I am not sure about the wildfires and flooding is always a challenge, but the model. But there's certainly a lot about just the buyers and sellers and the market dynamics and what managements think and boards think of the buyers and things like that. I think there's some people maybe were surprised with the outcomes of some of these -- and some of the losses that happened, and the accumulation and aggregation of them. So I think there's a lot of moving parts beyond what did a model say. Meyer Shields : Second question, as the property insurance book grows, is there any seasonality to how you plan to report results because so much of the ultimate profit is recognized at the back half of the year? Craig Howie : I think we pretty much have a fixed pick loss ratio that we keep throughout the year. Dom Addesso : And we do that -- it's less seasonal now that it\u2019s on the reinsurance book than it was when it was on the insurance book. Operator : And our final question for today comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Dom Addesso : Let me just interrupt there for a minute. There are more questions -- we were perhaps a little longer than usual in our opening remarks. So I don't mind going over a bit if you've some additional questions in queue, given it's the year end and given the nature of the results. So anyway, go ahead Brian. Brian Meredith : John, could you give us a sense of how much of the fourth quarter growth was one-off back up coverage those types of things? John Doucette : So across reinstatements and back up covers, it was about $200 million in total. Brian Meredith : Second question, I am just curious on your workers\u2019 comp business in California. Do you anticipate any pushback from regulators with respect to pricing and rate given tax reform? Jon Zaffino : Very uncertain at the moment. We're going to obviously watch the market carefully and continue to react based on what we see as underlying risk return characteristic. So we\u2019re following the same early commentary and we\u2019ll keep an eye on that. But at this stage, we have not seen anything different but we\u2019ll certainly be watching that closely in California and other jurisdictions as information becomes better now. Dom Addesso : I think that, Brian, will more likely be more of a personal lines issue than it\u2019s likely to be a commercial lines issue. And I think overtime the market will self-correct itself I'm not sure that regulators necessarily sometimes can help themselves will necessarily need to get involved in that particular kind of activity. Brian Meredith : And then a little bit bigger picture question here. As you\u2019re pricing your business both reinsurance and the insurance side, obviously, you could have build in some type of kind of loss trend either inflation assumptions, which you think are going forward. Would you all thinking on the loss trend upside over the next year or two? And how are you pricing the business and reserving for it? Dom Addesso : Well, that varies across various lines of business. So what we model in for work comp is different than what we build in for a casualty or excess liability, or property, it's were financial lines for that matter. So there isn\u2019t one how to answer to that question, but suffice to say that we\u2019re building trend in to all -- not only our pricing but also our reserving activities. Brian Meredith : And then last question would be just curious lot of growth going on. Any thoughts about, in your expenses, it's been going up relatively modestly. Any thoughts about whether you've got the infrastructure to handle this type of growth and could you put more growth on the current platform? Dom Addesso : Is that a question about reinsurance or insurance or both? Brian Meredith : I would say, on both sides. Dom Addesso : Well certainly, I'll talk to the reinsurance piece first. We've actually been adding resources. We talk a lot about adding new lines of business and diversifying our reinsurance platform. And we have been adding resources, technical resources to keep up with that or to generate those business opportunities and properly underwrite them. And I don\u2019t see that on the reinsurance side as particularly the problem given both nature of the premium that comes in on the reinsurance side, so not an issue at all. And frankly from an infrastructure point of view, we've added the resources and we have the management debt to deal with those types of accounts. On the insurance side, as Jonathan pointed out, our expense ratio just up slightly year-over-year and that scenario we also continue to add resources, as well as continue to invest in fiscals. So fact that we're able to maintain that expense ratio, I think is attribute to Jonathan and his team, as well as the rest of the support units within the organization that provide services to our insurance operation. So we continue to do -- the earned premium continues to build on the insurance operation. I think we\u2019re able to properly manage that expense ratio and at the same time, make the proper investments where we need to. Operator : And we did have a follow-up question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : My questions have been answered. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Dom Addesso : Well, good. Thank you all very much for your participation in the call this morning and for your questions as normal. Just to summarize, this has been record level of catastrophe losses. For the year, we think we've had more than respectable result and it's demonstrated the diversity of Everest, the growth that we've experienced in both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, demonstrates that we continue to add value to our customers, clients and brokers. And we expect that success that we had in '17 to continue into 2018. So thank you for your interest and your participation this morning. We look forward to any follow-up questions you might have after this call. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And once again, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. Beth Farrell : Thank you, Derek [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Everest Re Group\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note that statements made during today\u2019s call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various risks. As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom. Dom Addesso : Thanks, Beth. Good morning and welcome to the call this morning. As noted in the published financials, the core attritional results of the company continue to be quite favorable. And despite the prior year catch reported this quarter, the operating ROE of 10.5% is quite strong. Our reinsurance book produced a $96 million underwriting profit in the quarter and our insurance franchise more than double this underwriting profit to $12.5 million for the quarter. This reflects a continuing diversification effort due to classes of business that have adequate margins. With respect to the reinsurance segment, the underwriting profit is a consequence of improving margins in our property book, which I\u2019ll get back to in a minute, but also expanded writings in casually, mortgage and structured products. While mortgage and structured products have generally had excellent margin, we\u2019re finding the general casualty market is now firm perhaps in part due to less than expected improvement in company\u2019s margins on property business. However more prominent in the casualty market is the demand side. As underwriting income and primary market has been under pressure due to the property results, buyers have become more tuned to reducing volatility generally across their entire portfolio, driving more demand for casualty and whole account solutions. Industry consolidation oddly plays a part in that due to large buyers needed capacity and quality markets that can support that. With respect to the property market in general, the renewal season for reinsurance offered a better terms, but was somewhat below our expectation. This resulted in us reducing our participation in certain areas. However, our first quarter premiums were above the prior year due to rate and select new opportunities. These two factors, of course, need to increase margin per dollar of PML year-over-year. April is a key renewal for the Japan and Asia markets, which saw a slight improvement in rates, but the bright spot was the Caribbean renewals, which of course were loss affected. On balance, the reinsurance property market remains inconsistent and that there is less business that needs our current return hurdles, but enough that allowed us to increase our margin year-over-year. Our approach to different parts of the cycle has been to match capacity of the capital at the most efficient point in the curve. That means period of contraction, expansion, attachment point change et cetera whatever suits that particular period in the market. Consequently over time you tend to outperform in the market. We think the reinsurance focus continue that trend here in the first quarter. Our insurance operation continues its tremendous progress. While it may not be obvious given the similar attritional combined ratio year-over-year in fact the North American operation produced a 95.7 combined ratio in the quarter. The headwind, of course, is the international insurance build out, which was in the plan. During the balance of 2018, we expect the international operation to improve substantially as we are beginning to see our investments there payoff. Insurance premium growth remains healthy, but this growth creates a pull on earnings as earned premium lags the resource investment required. In addition some of our newer product offerings with lower expected loss ratios have not yet fully have their impact as the earned premium build is still developing. As the year progresses, we expect our expense ratio and loss ratio to improve as the accelerated growth in premium becomes earned in conjunction with a more normalized resource growth. We are quite optimistic about the ability of the insurance group to increase this level of profitability. The market will likely make that a challenging objective. However, we have demonstrated that our product diversity and scale is one that allows us to find the right opportunities. This is not unlike what I described regarding the reinsurance operation and cycle management. Before I end my comments about the underwriting operations, you surely want my comments regarding the wildfire losses booked this quarter. First let me say that this tragic event was so much more devastating than people imagine. These record events late last year were obviously hard to evaluate especially as a reinsurer, it was one further step we moved. Our loss selection for any particular event is based on a three prolonged approach that takes into consideration the estimated industry loss, modeled estimates and client discussions. Generally, we placed greater weight on the highest believed outlooks when establishing our reserves for catastrophe events. The models for these wildfire events were the lowest of the various estimates and as a consequence the reserves were largely based on our clients\u2019 insights into their expected loss. As many of you know our reserving philosophy, we believe that due to our various methodologies, our estimate was conservative. While this turned out not to be the case, we continue to expect that our overall 2017 year end reserve position will prove to be more than adequate to cover all losses that occurred in 2017 and prior, including cats. Finally, let me touch on investment income, which remains strong and is reflective of a continual evaluation of our asset allocation and a low but rising interest rate environment coupled with increasing volatility in the equity markets. Our slight rotation in allocation to the private equity markets with a bias towards fixed income from public equities has resulted in a pick up in investment income. Nevertheless, our core portfolio remains investment grade and naturally with the recent rise in rates is negatively affected our market values, thereby constraining our growth in book value. This is a relatively short-term challenge as our portfolio was on the shorter end with duration of three years. This of course means that over time these bonds will accrete to par and we will benefit from higher rates going forward. In summary based on the first quarter and what we see ahead, we remain quite optimistic and would expect to continue to produce a double-digit ROE including an expected cat load. This is a result of our diversified portfolio and strong market position as well as a solid balance sheet. Thanks for your participation this morning. I look forward to the discussion later and now to Craig for the financial report. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. This compares the net income of $292 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 results represents an annualized net income return on equity of 10%. Net income included $19 million of net after tax realized capital losses compared to $32 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the first quarter was $220 million compared to $267 million in 2017. As previously announced, the company\u2019s reporting of operating income now excludes foreign exchange gains and losses. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $108 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $183 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2018, Everest saw $100 million of catastrophe losses related to the 2017 California wildfires compared to $20 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2017. In comparing reported losses against our prior year catastrophe loss estimates and the impact of aggregate covers on attachment to specific events, we revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates except the California wildfires as previously announced. No other events breached our $10 million threshold in the first quarter of 2018, therefore any losses arising from these events were more than covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a little for events less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.1%, up from 84.5% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to changes in business mix and higher retrocession costs in 2018. John Doucette will explain more about these changes and his comments. Our reported combined ratio of 93% was higher than first quarter last year, primarily due to the higher reported catastrophe losses in 2018. For our investments, pretax investment income was $138 million for the quarter on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 13% above last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase in limited partnership income which was up $12 million from first quarter of 2017 and the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3% with the duration of just over three years. Foreign exchange is reported another income. For the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange gains were $10 million, compared to $4 million of losses in the first quarter of 2017. Other income also included less than $1 million of earnings and fees from Mt. Logan Re, compared to $2 million of income in the first quarter last year. On income taxes, the 6% effective tax rate on operating income was at the low end of our expected range of 7% to 8% for the full year. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the rest of the year. Should catastrophe losses come in lower than this estimate, it would be expected that the tax rate would go up. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, relatively flat, compared to year-end 2017. This is after taking into account the mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return through $53 million of dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018. Our capital position remains very strong. Thank you. Now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The Reinsurance Division delivered a strong first quarter with $96 million of underwriting profit premium growth of 22% and a better risk adjusted portfolio as compared to Q1 2017. After the record loss activity in 2017, rates were up as we indicated last quarter. At this pivotal 1/1 renewal, we focused on improving the quality of our portfolio, including its diversification by line of business and geography. To this end we were successful. Our clients and brokers increasingly gravitate to Everest as an enduring, relevant, long-term trading partner. Against this backdrop of increasing uncertainty for some of our competitors who are distracted by M&A activity, Everest provides stability and focus to the customer. Our growing global reinsurance franchise with broad product and distribution capabilities and industry-leading expense advantage and sophisticated capital and hedging capabilities, position us to maximize opportunities born from the continued disruption and evolution of the reinsurance market. This is further enhanced by the growing number of strategic partnerships that we are adding and developing across our entire organization. Our deepening relationships continue with our core clients and partners and extend beyond the traditional P&C landscape. These strategic relationships come in various forms, including global clients, quality upcoming underwriting organization. Staffed with underwriters we know well and respect cutting edge insurers, brokers with specialized distribution capabilities, niche businesses accessing unique and diversifying risks, highly specialized MTAs and asset managers and alternative capital investors. Combining the accompanying, enhanced capabilities derived from these partnerships with our nimble execution, we are better positioned to thrive where the continuum of asset risk and insurance risk is blurred. Before I comment on recent renewals, here is an overview of the Reinsurance Division\u2019s results. Overall, Reinsurance premium showed strong growth at $1.4 billion, an increase of 22% from the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by broad growth across the U.S., Middle East and Africa, Latin America and European operations, including both rate increases and a higher volume from pro-rata contracts. Our loss ratio was elevated by 9.8 points, with 6.5 points due to the $100 million of loss emanating from the California wildfires in our U.S. operations. Adjusting for these wildfire catastrophe losses and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio is up 3.2 points due to business mix with a higher share of new property and casualty pro-rata opportunities, additional long-tail treaties, some loss portfolio transfer business and higher retrocessional costs in the quarter, compared to Q1 2017. Our estimates for the Harvey, Irma and Maria losses remain unchanged in total across the group. However, the losses both across business segments and by event have been allocated differently as more data became available. Directionally, we saw upward movement on our estimates due to increased loss adjustment expenses, while we saw reductions on Maria and Mexican earthquake estimates as development has not been as significant as initially estimated. Now for some additional comments by Reinsurance Division. In our U.S. Reinsurance Division, we saw our first quarter premium increase 11% year on year to $644 million, benefiting from post loss rate increases, additional property and professional liability pro-rata business and increased structured products writing. The attritional loss ratio is up 3.4 primarily due to higher corporate retrocession cost recorded to this segment and the impact of business mix. The 14-point loss ratio improvement seen in our Bermuda segment and the 22 point improvement in the International segment are due to the aforementioned reallocation of cat losses between segments. Our Bermuda reinsurance segment premium grew 29% in U.S. dollars to $416 million and 25% on a constant dollar basis. Some of the growth was recognition of written premiums from prior underwriting years with the balance supported by new professional liability and casualty quota share business, capital relief trades and reinsurance opportunities. As many Lloyd\u2019s markets increased their hedging activity, amidst the adjustments to their underwriting strategies. Adjusting for cats and prior year development, the attritional loss ratio was up about five points, mostly due to business mix. The international reinsurance segment premium was up 38% to $367 million. Premium growth was broad based across Latin America, Middle East and Africa, Canada, Singapore and facultative markets. Some growth was due to timing of premiums on certain accounts. However, the current year attritional underwriting result was largely stable compared to Q1 2017. In terms of catastrophe capital management, we recently executed on reinsurance protection supported by two new Kilimanjaro cat bonds. These new cat bonds with total capacity of $525 million, replace expiring bonds, protecting us from hurricanes and earthquakes in the U.S., Canada and some areas in the Caribbean. The maturities are split into four-year and five-year terms and all provide annual aggregate protection. The overall retro costs are up year-over-year, because of the additional Kilimanjaro II cat bonds that were issued in Q2 last year. This additional coverage along with Mt. Logan and traditional reinsurance and retrocessional hedges protect our group\u2019s PML holistically, allowing us to prudently manage within our cat risk appetite across all reinsurance and insurance segments. Now I will provide a brief update on resent renewal activity. In our property operations, we have captured double-digit rate increases in loss affected markets, while ceding commissions where largely stable. Competition from ILS Capital prevented further rises in rates. At Everest, we focused on improving the risk reward balance as we lead the market with corrective rate increases on deal, while although finding new attractive opportunities. In casualty markets, there is a modest firming our reinsurance terms. Casualty access rates are generally up in the single-digit and ceding commissions down for our U.S. deal, internationally ceding commissions are stable. April 1 renewals in Asia would best be described as stable pricing with some increase in demand particularly from the larger companies and mutual such as in Japan. We also renewed some loss affected areas such as the Caribbean where prices were up, reflective of the 2017 loss activity. In these areas, we have been able to deploy the same or more capacity at increase rates. Alternative capital and M&A is a presence in our business. Given this reality Everest has taken the opportunity to step up as a stable partner, capable of navigating the increasingly dynamic reinsurance markets. This resulted in better access to good business through increase signings on layers we found attractively priced including some private deals not shown to the full reinsurance market. We also provide assistance to some of our clients experiencing operational disruption through both traditional and structured solutions tailored to address the evolving needs. A key lesson so far in 2018 that is already well known, but perhaps underappreciated, is that reinsurers cannot rely on hard markets to offset subpar results in non-loss years. Having understood this to be the case for some time, Everest will continue to develop its capabilities to maintain relevance namely global breadth of capabilities across various classes of business, while continuing our territorial expansion and developing new products, creative structuring to deliver customized solutions to our clients, meaningful capacity supported by advanced capital and hedging capabilities to Mt. Logan, Kilimanjaro cat bonds traditional reinsurance and retro and ILWs. All supported by an efficient expense structure and nimble execution in size leveraging our flat and empowered organization. Sustainable franchises must maintain relevance and profitability and the ability to trade forward through major industry losses to ultimately be successful in the long-term. Thank you. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jon Zaffino : Thank you, John, and good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report solid start of the year for our global insurance operations. As measured across numerous metrics, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the many strategic and tactical actions taken over the past several years to completion our insurance operations for sustainable success. This of course, include the achievement of consistent underwriting profits across our steadily expanding portfolio. Globally growth written premium was $505 million for the quarter, 16% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and as strong as first quarter production we have experienced in the history of Everest Insurance. We continue to invest in thoughtful only focused growth within our chosen product segments across our global operations and this quarter\u2019s results are a testament to that. Most importantly in the quarter, this growth resulted in underwriting profit of $12.5 million more than double the $5.1 million underwriting profit from the first quarter of 2017. Further, our attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improve 1.7 points to 66.1%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business in the earned premium impact of these businesses into the P&L. These more recently establish portfolios accounted for a record 22% of our net earned premium in the quarter and will continue to expand in the quarters ahead. We remain confident that our vision to organically build a world class specialty diversified insurance organization is being realized. As we have reported in prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams in place across the globe continue to execute on their individual and collective mandates. Our teams remain focused and our opportunity set measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business continues to grow. We will look to build on this momentum throughout the year. Turning to the financial highlights. As mentioned the global insurance operations produced $505 million in growth written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $71 million or 16% over first quarter 2017, another solid quarter showing steady improvement and evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and acted in health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. Further, this represents a 13th consecutive quarter of growth across the insurance organization. Turning to net premiums. For the first quarter of 2018 net premiums grew by 12% to $386 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $393 million, an increase of $69 million or 21%. Net written premium will lag growth written premium as we continue to take a fairly conservative reinsurance position, which we believe supports our growth across our underwriting divisions. Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 96.8%, an improvement of 1.6 points over first quarter of 2017. The attritional combined ratio was 98% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the first quarter of 2017 attritional of 98.1% and is roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 attritional combined ratio of 97.8%. That stated this year\u2019s first quarter, North American operations were 94% of the premium volume resided achieved a 95.7% combined ratio along with a 4 point improvement in the attritional loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The overall reported GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 64.9%, improving 3.3 points over last year 68.2%. In addition to the attritional improvement the loss ratio was beneficially impacted by 1.2 points of favorable prior year development from 2016 cat activity, again reflecting our conservative reserving position on these events. As anticipated, the downward drift and the attritional loss ratio continues. Again this is a result of an improved mix of business, the benefits from the many new business is launched and a strategic underwriting actions of the past three years. Turning to the expense ratio. Due to the timing of certain one-time expense items and the lag in earned premium from the build out of new businesses, our expense ratio in the first quarter was 31.9%, up from the 30.2% from the same period of 2017. We expect our expense ratio to improve throughout the year and to remain in a competitive range. It\u2019s important to remember that we continue to invest in all patterns of our organization, while maintaining underwriting discipline. As a result, written premiums may fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter as well the expense ratio. However, we anticipate the annual expense ratio to be within our expectations. I\u2019ll turn now to the market conditions and in particular offer some commentary on the rate environment. As the quarter progressed, we thought improved P&C pricing trend across the organization. Overall rate levels for Everest Insurance were slightly negative decreasing by 2.4 points in the quarter. However, it should be noted that this rate study was derived from a renewal book that was lighter than usual based on the lower planned retention. The retention softness was influenced by deliberate underwriting actions impacting our U.S. property portfolio and our delegated authority operation Everest underwriting partners. If we exclude the work comp book, the rate change for the organization was plus 4.6% for the first quarter, with a steadily progressing level of rates being achieved across a number of lines each month. This is more than double the increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, where we experience a 2% increase on the same basis and as the highest aggregate price change we had experienced in ten quarters. This result was led by various lines of business, notably property and commercial auto. Let me spend a minute on the property book, as it is one area of the market experiencing a notable degree of transition. We currently underwrite property portfolios across the globe with a concentration in the U.S. market through both retail and wholesale channels. But in the U.S. market, we have now experienced six consecutive months of positive rate change in our property portfolio, ending the first quarter at plus 13% on a risk adjusted basis. As HIM exposed renewals come up in the second quarter, we expect continued pricing improvement of a similar magnitude. Overall, we do believe there is a need for further rate firming within the property market cat and non-cat alike and across other markets as well. Turning to other lines, commercial auto continues to see meaningful increases, again, in the low double-digit range across our various portfolios. We continued to see slightly positive rate moment for GL and excess lines, each registering positive rate changes in the quarter, we believe continue to rate adjustments are needed within these areas as we moved to 2018. Various professional lines continued to see some rate pressure, although this trend is moderating in the first quarter particularly in March. And work comp markets remain competitive with single-digit rate decreases being common. We continue to feel comfortable with the composition of our workers\u2019 comp book and margin associated with it in our underwriting strategies going forward. We have been in this market for many years and will continued to take a cautious view in this or any area of the market should rate pressures continue. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on the need to achieve adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective everyday. In conclusion, the momentum we established in 2017 across our global specialty insurance operations has continued into 2018. Strong premium growth and solid profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments across our platform. We continue to thoughtfully invest to ensure we have the talents, capabilities and resources to profitably expand our franchise, while building increased resiliency across our business. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you in next quarter. Now back to Beth for Q&A. Beth Farrell : Yes, Travis, we are now open for questions. Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Yes. Thank you very much. Post tax reform, I would have thought in my mind that this means that more reinsurance business we were in onshore in the United States. The way you\u2019re stagnant reporting work, it\u2019s seems that the greatest on growths in international and Bermuda. I\u2019m wondering if there is a weakest than U.S. reinsurance. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something to that, maybe you can disabuse me of some facts that they have that are incorrect or what not. Craig Howie : Josh, this is Craig Howie. Technically the tax rate is based on the operating tax, based on geographic region and where that income is coming from. What we have done throughout this year and that includes by the way catastrophes and any reserve development as well. But what you saw in the first quarter and the reason for a lower tax rate is the fact that we had the catastrophe losses were emanating from the United States and the majority of those releases were coming from the other segments, including the Bermuda segment. Joshua Shanker : Well and not so much on tax which is about where clients put their reinsurance business is more business can be written in the United States going forward just in general post tax reform. Or is that incorrect way of thinking about things. John Doucette : Hi, Josh, this is John. I think it really \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we can speak for other people, because I think part of it\u2019s going to be a function of the capital. What the capital structures of different reinsurers are. But a couple of things, we have a fair bit of capital both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we\u2019re going to continue to try to access the business in the most advantageous way that we see based on our underwriting expertise, based on our connection to brokers and clients and things like that. And that will \u2013 so it really is opportunity dependent as to where we\u2019re going to write the business, whether it\u2019s going to be in the U.S. reinsurance segment, the Bermuda reinsurance segment or the international segment Joshua Shanker : Okay. And as we had into mid-year renewals compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year. What is the trend on International property and U.S. property, I guess, do we think that will be about the same. Do we think that that one-one deployment was the way to go? What\u2019s sort of your thing on the year at this moment? John Doucette : So as we talked about last quarter, I think it really depends on geographically, where the business is and what the loss impact was by the specific business. That would drive a lot of what the rate discussions are going forward. So no surprise areas that had been affected by the HIM losses or the California wildfires saw more rate increase at one-one. As we mentioned earlier in our script, when it came to April 1, which is a big Asia renewal particularly Japan, it was a lot closer to stable. And, but we did see rate increases in some of the Caribbean areas that did have the losses. So I think it does follow the loss events, in terms of where it\u2019s going to go at the upcoming renewals, we think that would also hold directionally true that the areas that had more losses would have upward pressure on rates. And we\u2019ll see what happens and we\u2019re positioned to take advantage of it based on what the rating environment is and what products that we think is most attractive. And as we talked about and you saw in this quarter, sometimes that\u2019ll be excess or loss sometimes that will be proportional, sometimes it\u2019ll be reinsurance, sometimes it will be retro. And we try to really capture where we think we\u2019re getting the best risk adjusted return, irrespective of the product. And so that results in some of the changes you saw in this quarter. But we are comfortable that, no matter where the rate changes and the rate pressures are or not. And trends will be able to capture that. Craig Howie : And I\u2019ll add to that, as I mentioned as well in our opening comments that there\u2019s an improving trend in casualty as well. So increased opportunity there to meet our margin requirements. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very and good luck for the rest of the year. Craig Howie : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you, and good morning. So I just wonder, could you break down the impact from both mix change as well as the retro \u2013 high retro cost. The deterioration of attritional combined ratio about 260 basis points year-over-year. Just wonder, what are the sort of onetime impact or this could be dragging on for the rest of the year. John Doucette : The onetime impact from the change in the attritional. Kai Pan : Yes. John Doucette : Well I mean, as my colleague\u2019s comment as well, but let me just first make the comment that the change in the attritional is largely due to mix of business. And influx of pro-rata business in the first quarter was driving at the attritional. But remember that overall that our premium will be coming in for the balance of the year and will served increase our overall margin. But even though the ratios might be going up, because of pro-rata business has a lot more premium on the books and therefore that will contribute to an increased underwriting margin. So we have to be careful about whether we\u2019re talking about ratios or margin. So\u2026 Kai Pan : Okay. Dom Addesso : Wonder that John may have a comment here as well. John Doucette : Yeah, Kai. just a little more color on that. We also \u2013 we alluded to it a couple of times, but if you recall in Q2 2017, we won \u2013 we issued what was called Kilimanjaro II catastrophe bond. So that was in from second quarter last year and it remains in effect now. It was not in Q1 2017 and that\u2019s part of the elevated, because of that additional issuance of catastrophe bond back in the second quarter, but not in the first. That\u2019s why that Q1-to-Q1 comparison reflects that. Dom Addesso : And that\u2019s about one full point in the quarter. Kai Pan : So, the second thing in quarter year-over-year comparison will be one point easier? John Doucette : It would be more comparative in the second quarter, because it was issued in April of last year. Kai Pan : Okay. Got it. John Doucette : In the second quarter of last year. Kai Pan : Okay. So the point is that the revenue will grow faster, but the ratio, attritional commodity ratio would go higher, because of mix change, but the net, the dollar amounts margin, underwriting margin, expiry margin will be higher. John Doucette : That\u2019s our belief. Kai Pan : Okay, great. And then can you talk about that the loss cost trend, especially in the cash utilized. Dom Addesso : I\u2019ll ask Jon Zaffino, because that\u2019s heavily impacted in the insurance book. But of course, it\u2019s a direct carry-over to reinsurance. So Jon, maybe you can highlight some of the trends we\u2019re seeing. Jon Zaffino : Sure, Dom. Thanks. Good morning, Kai. As of the usual sort of caveat, loss cost trends do vary widely from a line-to-line, from geography-to-geography, from program structure-to-program structure. And I\u2019ll tell you in general, we see a relatively consistent picture over the prior few quarters. If we would aggregate our book based on premium weightings, the short, medium, long tail lines, I think we feel we\u2019re in about that 3% range, 2.5% to 3% could be higher and it\u2019d be lower in certain areas. For instance, commercial auto, we think is running above that. Some of the comp lines depend on geography territory; it could be a little bit below. But it\u2019s been relatively what we expected and anticipated, we are certainly looking at various frequency and severity trends quarter-to-quarter each one of our various books of business studies that we conduct throughout the year and keeping an eye on that. So, as we expected at this point based on our \u2013 what we thought pricing would be based on where we reserve our books, it\u2019s been kind of in line for our early expectations. Dom Addesso : So, I think the way to summarize that would be really nothing in excess or out of bounds relative to what we see as general inflation across the entire economy. Kai Pan : Okay, great. And last one if I may just on the industry consolidation, do you see any opportunities for Everest Re? Dom Addesso : This comes up frequently, and I think I\u2019ve mentioned many times, we look at probably all of the opportunities that are around in the marketplace, and generally a bit while there will potentially be opportunity certainly nothing that we can speak to today. but generally, we have included in all of these that relative because of \u2013 in part, because of the price of many of these properties. And probably more importantly, the integration challenges in particular and the expense challenge of integrating operations. We tilt towards an organic build. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can do that successfully and organic build you end up knowing exactly what you\u2019ve got and you can shape and mold the operation to your liking as opposed to having to tear something apart. So that\u2019s our preference, but it doesn\u2019t mean if something wouldn\u2019t come along that would \u2013 that would fit strategically for us in an area that move not yet fully developed, so that\u2019s how I think about it. Kai Pan : It\u2019s great. Thank you so much. John Doucette : Just to add a little more color, outside of the M&A question, the fact that there is a lot of M&A, and activity and discussion, we think does present opportunities for us particularly on the reinsurance side. And as Dom alluded to in his opening comments, some of the consolidation results and some of that we\u2019ve seen the large global buying more, and they want to buy from companies like Everest that have a strong balance sheet, and right P&C lines of business all over the world. And so their capacity demands are increasing and we\u2019re seeing some of the large global insurers buying more and buying more in the casualty and professional lines. And so that was part of the reason why we had the growth that we had in Q1. Kai Pan : Thank you, John. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from our Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. good morning. I want to dig in a little bit to John Doucette\u2019s comment on relevance. Am I oversimplifying if I interpret that as implying sort of a desire to more rapidly increase your casualty book in reinsurance? Dom Addesso : In reinsurance or insurance? Meyer Shields : In reinsurance. John Doucette : So Meyer, I think it we \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s, we don\u2019t start with, we want to write more causality business. We start with where can we build the footprint that makes the most sense on a diversified global portfolio across as many lines of business, and make the best risk-adjusted portfolio we can. We are seeing opportunities in the causality space more than we had. We have been fairly negative on casualty and professional liability for the last several years and maybe a little bit ahead of the curve. And we think that was the right call, and we are now seeing more opportunities. So, it\u2019s more a function of what we think the risk-adjusted pricing is. But the point of the relevance is that we have the ability, we have the underwriting expertise, we have the market expertise in local markets all around the globe. And we have the relationships with the brokers and clients to be able to deploy the capacity in any property and casualty line as we see, witness our clients need to buy. And we think that helps us along with the alternative capital that we can use to deploy in the property space. We think helps us be more and more relevant to our clients. Dom Addesso : But it doesn\u2019t necessarily suggest that we\u2019re riding business at any cost. I mean, again, get back to whether it\u2019s in the reinsurance of operation or the insurance operation, the heavy emphasis on cycle management and that applies line-by-line. At the same time, we are trying to achieve greater diversification too. So these are all things that I think have led to a more stable result for the group, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Meyer Shields : Okay. I didn\u2019t mean to just you were accepting on the price business, I just wanted to know whether strategically clients recognize that there\u2019s maybe more underwriting expertise in Everest than premium volumes themselves would suggest? Dom Addesso : Well, I think that\u2019s absolutely the case, and even more importantly, that\u2019s clearly the case in insurance, where the brand is being fully \u2013 more fully developed. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And second question if I can, just looking at the comments on larger global insurers looking for more reinsurance, are they a tougher customer to deal with maybe because of an additional specification? John Doucette : This is John; I think you know there\u2019s pluses and minuses with every type of client that we trade with. They have they bring stability, they bring diversity, they bring again, to our point of trying to have a diverse portfolio they are buying from us in Latin America, in Asia, in Europe and obviously in North America and Bermuda and London. And so it allows us to across that relationship have a more stable relationship. But again, there\u2019s \u2013 some of them are more or less reinsurance dependent than if you go to the other end of the spectrum of much, much smaller clients that are very reinsurance dependent given their capital structure and their writings. So there\u2019s pluses and minuses of all types of clients that we trade with. Dom Addesso : Meyer, this is really \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a negative to have a sophisticated trading partner. In fact, I think it would be quite a positive, because they are more easily recognized the strength and the value that Everest can bring to the transaction. So I view it as a positive and as John was really highlighting, I think we find that having those broader and larger relationships tends to overtime; we tend to have a more stable margin. in any one area, you might be tilted the sideways a bit, but across the entire account, you tend to have greater stability. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Dom Addesso : Thanks, Meyer. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. my first question in terms of premium growth, I guess this is tied specifically to reinsurance, do you see \u2013 you guys being able to maintain the same growth level that we saw in the first quarter. As you think about these new opportunities that you\u2019re seeing for the balance of the year. And then also if we could just get the color from most of your segments, you really highlighted where you\u2019re growing geographically. a little bit more color by line and how much more crop and even credit mortgage business is within the growth that we saw in the first quarter? John Doucette : Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s John. So in terms of the growth, I mean, so a part of the growth is kind of a two-pronged issue. We rode business including proportional business at one-one and we rode more, and we would see that earn-in over the next several quarters. So we will see some growth tied to that, in terms of whether we see new business that incept when we put on the books. in future quarters, we think so, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be at the same rate that we\u2019ve seen so far. it\u2019s a lot harder for us to predict that, but there is the embedded growth that we\u2019ve had from the business we\u2019ve already put on the books. We do think that we have been expanding our opportunity set for example, developing political risk and trade credit in our Zurich operation; it\u2019s just one of the many examples around the group that we\u2019ve been doing to try to build out our opportunities that expand that. and therefore that gives the opportunity to grow more. you mentioned crop. crop was fairly flat. So their growth isn\u2019t really coming there. We are seeing more both in the U.S., Bermuda and in our Bermuda operation in London, we are seeing more casualty professional and some whole account opportunities, and we continue as we\u2019ve said on the last several quarters. We are writing the mortgage business that\u2019s up a little bit or close to flat, but we do continue to see new opportunities in the mortgage space and I think we\u2019ll be able to deploy capacity on an attractive risk adjusted basis there, and as you may recall, a lot of the mortgage deals that are done with the GSEs or multi-year deals. So, we have effectively IBNR premium coming in over the next many years for deals that we\u2019ve already put on the books. Elyse Greenspan : How much mortgage businesses within the Reinsurance segment today? John Doucette : We have a run rate of about a $150 million to $175 million give-or-take that shows the new business origination. Elyse Greenspan : And that\u2019s an annual number? John Doucette : Yeah. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 you guys didn\u2019t see any reserve development quarterly from the cat. Was there any movements or was just kind of net neutral within all the segments in the quarter? Dom Addesso : Elyse, we \u2013 as you know, we do our reserve studies that the bulk of our reserve studies in the latter part of the year in the fourth quarter. But of the other metrics that we use to develop to evaluate reserves along the way are at each quarter-end. Something we call actual versus expected were all trending favorable. But it\u2019s a consequence we don\u2019t \u2013 and we don\u2019t make reserve adjustments based on those metrics. We wait for the reserves that\u2019s quite \u2013 but the trends, the metrics that we use are all favorable. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then one last question in terms of the primary insurance business, Don, when you \u2013 in your initial remarks, you said that the expense ratio and loss ratio would improve as the year progresses. I guess is the goal, should we think about modeling for the back three quarters that you guys will be in kind of that low 90s overall underlying margin within the primary insurance business. Dom Addesso : We have said in last quarter\u2019s call, low-to-mid 90s is kind of what our target is. It\u2019s a little difficult to give you a precise number, but it would certainly be an improvement over \u2013 a measurable improvement over the last year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Elyse. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue. Dom Addesso : All right. let me thank you very much. Let me conclude with just a few thoughts. We\u2019re up to a great start for the year. The changing mix, which we\u2019ve talked about already will certainly impact being the attritional ratios, will in fact produce an overall increase to the total dollar margin as the year develops. We fully expect as you\u2019ve heard from my colleagues rates to be improving both property and the casualty areas in certainly sufficient quantity and difficult, class of the business, who will allow us to increase our overall returns here and again, we are confident about our ROEs. Finally, if you just give me one second, I\u2019d like to close with a tribute to our colleague Beth Farrell, who is retiring in early May after 15 plus years with Everest. I know she has been a valuable resource to those on the call. I certainly appreciate the support she is giving me. We will miss her, but wish her and her husband a full and enjoyable retirement. Thank you so much, Beth. Beth Farrell : Thank you. Dom Addesso : And again, thank you all for your interest this morning and look forward to our future discussions over the weeks ahead. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

On the call today are Dom Addesso, the company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, please note that the company\u2019s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining our call this morning. The second quarter of 2018 was a decidedly mixed quarter for Everest. Surely, the bottom line results were not where we wanted them to be driven by the reserve charge we pre-announced. Nonetheless, it was another quarter of the successful execution of our strategy. We had a lot of success executing on the opportunities that have been presented to us in the market. We have seen strong premium growth both in our insurance and reinsurance business. Plus in both segments, our underwriting and re-underwriting actions have driven improvements in the attritional loss ratio and the profit margin embedded in our portfolio. Of course, the progress towards our strategic objectives is masked by the reserve charge. No doubt, this adjustment was disappointing. And while it reflects some broader underlying trends going on in the market, in reality we know it will require us to improve and make changes to recognize these trends. The underlying cause of the reserve shortfall can be attributed to two factors, which were not apparent to us at year end. First, our clients are seeing a large number of reopened claims largely stemming from the AOB threat in Florida. Ceding companies were trying to settle claims quickly conceivably to mitigate the AOB issue. The loss reports we received from clients showed a high percentage of closed claims very clearly and we were encouraged by these reports. Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than what they originally closed their claim. To a lesser extent, but for the same reasons, the claims reopening, has impacted Puerto Rico after Maria as well driving up losses, which crystallized in the second quarter. The reality was that these closed claim statistics we were seeing were a false positive. The second factor was the extraordinary rise relative to past events in loss adjustment expenses. The expense numbers we are seeing are significantly above our historical data. In fact we saw some treaties experience high 30s and even 40% expense loads. Again, these numbers only began to emerge in the second quarter claim reports. Both of these factors reopened claims and a much higher than expected LAE were the overwhelming reasons for the increases we saw. Our reserves at year end for our core reinsurance cat portfolio contemplated demand surge, but these developments were beyond anything seen before. In addition, when coupled with the California wildfires, it had a leveraged impact on our aggregate retro book. I would refer to this as the cliff factor. In other words, our previous analysis had many of our clients\u2019 retro accounts not attaching, now some are very much in the money. So while these are the observations, it demands that we respond to what maybe the new normal. Going forward, cat pricing will need to reflect a higher level of loss adjustment expenses, particularly for those accounts that rely heavily on third-party adjustment services. While some of the LAE level was driven by scarcity of resources due to multiple, almost simultaneous events, for example, citizens doubled their standard adjusted fees due to the shortage created by Hurricane Harvey. Our pricing needs to better consider this new reality, plus our reserving process going forward needs to be refined to consider these factors when there are multiple events as seen in 2017. This commentary I have just gone through hopefully clarifies the circumstances and our recognition that we need to respond appropriately to changing market conditions. However, while we did temporarily get the scorekeeping wrong make no mistake that we are playing the game at a high level and we will continue to do so. Our profits from our cat portfolio were $3.5 billion over the last 5 years. This business comes with volatility, but the appropriate reward for the risk is evident. Finally, given the extraordinary circumstances of the 2017 cats and the separate process we use in setting cat reserves versus non-cat reserves, our review of our current reserves finds no read across on the adequacy of our non-cat reserves. We are very comfortable that our track record of conservatively setting our non-cat reserves continues. While these catastrophes obviously dominate the conversation, I would reiterate that other key parts of the organization are doing excellent and the attritional results are reflective of that. It is critical. The continued improvement is adding profitable diversification to our portfolio. The reinsurance portfolio has seen continued growth in mortgage and other credit related business as well as a revival of our casualty book, where pricing has improved considerably allowing us to entertain more deals. Overall, reinsurance premiums earned have risen almost 30% in the first half of the year to $2.5 billion, with an attritional combined ratio of 81.7%. This is an encouraging result as we move into the second half. The improvements in the attritional results reflect the trend we noted in the first quarter. The insurance business continues its growth trajectory, where premiums earned in the first half have increased by 17%. This growth number is understated due to the cancellation and re-underwriting of certain legacy parts of that portfolio. In fact, the new business initiatives, along with the existing go-forward portfolios, have grown almost 30% or $300 million. As a result of re-underwriting and new growth areas, the book is now demonstrating more consistent profitability. The improving trend in the attritional is illustrated in the investor deck. Our new products are now earning in as you will note by comparing earned premium to written, which should continue to improve our margins. We are well-positioned to produce a good second half. Thank you. And my colleagues will elaborate further and they of course welcome your questions at the end. Craig? Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had net income of $70 million in the second quarter of 2018. This compares to net income of $246 million for the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $280 million compared to $537 million for the first half of 2017. The quarter and year-to-date results were impacted by current and prior year catastrophe losses. Net income included $9 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $50 million of capital gains in the first half of 2017. The 2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $40 million compared to $234 million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $260 million compared to $501 million for the first 6 months of 2017. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $20 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $313 million in the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio for the group was 99.4% compared to 88.3% reported in the first half of 2017 impacted by the higher catastrophe losses in 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported a $400 million pre-tax increase in its estimates for prior year catastrophe events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. The increase was primarily related to the 2017 storm events, was about one-third of the change related to reopened claims reported in the second quarter, about one-third coming from higher loss adjustment expenses and the other third coming from the impact on retro aggregate covers. The group also saw $65 million of current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance. Of the total, $50 million related to Cyclone Mekunu in Oman and Yemen and $15 million related to the late winter storms in the United States. This compares to $54 million of catastrophes during the second quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $565 million compared to $74 million during the first half of 2017. Partially offsetting the catastrophe development was $97 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves. The prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2018. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both from the United States and internationally. The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don\u2019t react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years unchanged. Excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio for the first 6 months was 85.3% compared to 85.6% in the first half of 2017. With the improvement in the attritional combined ratio and the 25% growth in earned premium, the underwriting profit has improved by more than $100 million on an attritional basis for the first 6 months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Our expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2018 down slightly from 5.8% for the same period last year. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter and $280 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $23 million or 9% from 1 year ago. This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14 million from the first half of 2017 and the fixed income portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.1% compared to 2.9% 1 year ago as both the investment grade and alternative fixed income portfolios are up year-over-year. The duration of the portfolio remains at just over 3 years. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the income associated with the loss reserve releases in the quarter. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. The expected range for the full year is now 0% to 6%. Lower than expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend toward the higher end of this range. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $133 million for the first half of 2018 compared to $634 million in 2017. The decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 compared to 2017. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.2 billion at the end of the second quarter compared to $8.4 billion at year end 2017. The decline in shareholders\u2019 equity in the first half of 2018 is primarily attributable to the $232 million mark-to-market impact on the investment portfolio and capital returned through $106 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million of share buybacks offset by $280 million of net income. The company returned 47% of net income to shareholders. Our capital position remains very strong. Thank you. And now, John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Q2 was the first renewal season following the catastrophes in 2017 for some loss affected areas, notably Puerto Rico and some of the Caribbean at April 1 as well as Florida at June 1. Overall, the markets were mixed. And from a rate perspective, they varied based on loss activity as well as macro and local supply demand factors. However, these and other renewals in Q2 provided our underwriters with an opportunity to reshape our portfolio by capturing higher risk adjusted rewards. We improved our portfolio by achieving rate increases, particularly on loss affected Puerto Rican and Caribbean accounts, growing share with some key Florida clients, reallocating capacity to different attachment points and better priced layers. We also saw more turnover in the book as we decreased shares or declined poorly priced deals and scaled up capacity on more attractively priced opportunities. Shifting capacity from excess of loss layers and proportional treaties on programs to where we are paid the best risk-adjusted price using our leading re-insurer position in the market to get preferred signings and utilizing both alternative capital and our equity capital to most efficiently match risk to capital all position us for better than market results. These advantages benefit us even for flat renewals and help drive some of this year\u2019s premium growth. Our reinsurance gross written premium for Q2 was $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion year-to-date, which is a 29% growth in premium over year-to-date 2017 driven by growth in all of our reinsurance segments. Some of our growth in reinsurance was due to increased excess of loss and quota share participation on existing treaties and also new quota share treaties with improved profitability following the 2017 cat losses. In addition, we achieved some impactful reinsurance successes with several key global clients who want to trade more broadly with leading global re-insurers such as Everest Re across multiple lines of business around the world. Over the last several years, we have deployed significant resources to understand and be responsive to the risk transfer and risk financing needs of our global clients. Consequently, we continually expand our strategic relationships with several of these global clients and thus meaningfully have increased our in-force profitability and future opportunities with them. We also benefited from rate improvement in certain lines, especially loss affected property lines and select casualty and professional lines. We believe our current portfolio overall is stronger and more resilient than it has been for a long time. As Dom stated, our results did suffer from development on the 2017 events predominantly from Irma and Maria. The confluence of three significant catastrophe losses within 5 weeks caused a surge in demand for loss adjusters, inflating loss adjustment expenses to exceptional level. In addition, claim reopening frequency in both Florida and Puerto Rico were higher than expected. As noted earlier, the combination of increasing loss estimates due to reopen and loss adjustment expenses, coupled with the losses on the California wildfires, had a more severe impact to aggregate covers which we wrote. Including the 2017 loss emergence, reinsurance produced 107% combined ratio for the quarter. However, our attritional combined ratio was 79.8% for the quarter and 81.7% year-to-date compared to 84.2% and 82.1% respectively in the prior year periods. This quarter\u2019s loss ratio benefited almost 2 points from lower non-cat weather losses and a better expected loss ratio. The improved attritional combined ratios are noteworthy given the increased share of proportional business and additional casualty writings, which both typically run to a higher attritional combined ratio than a more property dominated excess of loss portfolio. In our U.S. reinsurance segment, gross written premium of $1.3 billion year-to-date grew 23% versus the same period last year. Growth was broad-based across property and casualty lines. We saw new opportunities for excess of loss and pro rata deals, which included some new commercial and personal pro rata business, additional mortgage writings, reinstatement premiums and increased facultative writings. The Q2 year-to-date combined ratio was 116.8%. The corresponding loss ratio was elevated by 43 points of cat losses, mainly from the development on hurricanes Irma and Maria and the combined impact that these losses had with other 2017 events on aggregate covers. However, the year-to-date attritional loss ratio decreased 2 points to 54%. The international segment, with gross written premium of $766 million, grew by 31% in this year-to-date period. This included growth in Latin America on new opportunities and larger post-loss treaty participations, increased pro rata writings and additional capacity deployed on international fac deals in an improved post loss rate environment as well as growth in new lines of business around the world such as Indian crop reinsurance out of our Singapore office and new products out of our Canadian operations. The combined ratio for the first 6 months was 88.2%. The 6 month loss ratio was impacted by 14 points of catastrophe losses, which included about $50 million from Cyclone Mekunu in Oman, with the rest predominantly from Hurricane Maria. The attritional loss ratio is running about flat year-to-date at 51%. The Bermuda segment had gross written premium of $785 million or 41% growth during the first half, with contributions from writings covering various territories and lines of business. This included growth in London, Zurich and Bermuda operations in various lines in both excess and pro rata business and included some large opportunities with multinational insurers and continued expansion of our trade credit, surety and political risk capabilities and writings. The segment achieved an 83.6% combined ratio in the first half with the attritional loss ratio up less than 1 point to 58.6%. The loss ratio was affected by business mix, including additional premium. Now, turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal. Overall, the market offered modest rate increases for both property and casualty. Accordingly, we did not just follow the market, but proactively structured our global property portfolio in a competitive post-loss rate environment to maximize our returns by allocating larger lines on more attractive deals and reducing or declining under-priced deals. Through this process, we improved our portfolio for this renewal season, representing a better risk adjusted return as we head into this wind season with less exposed limit, less PML, more premium and more expected profit than last year. While some competition on the property side sought to increase market share, we stock with accretive deals from our core clients that recognize the Everest long-term value proposition. In the end, particularly with the increased deployment of capacity to capped pro rata treaties, we materially increased our premium while our cat exposure is flat or down depending on the territory and return period. With respect to our casualty portfolio, we achieved some rate increases and lower ceding commissions. Modest improvement in reinsurance terms continued as the casualty reinsurance market has stabilized considerably from recent years. In addition, we added new profitable casualty business, which was not offered to much of the reinsurance market. Whether due to our long-term client and broker relationships, superior ratings, balance sheet strength or the ability to lead reinsurance programs for clients in all P&C lines around the world, we are often included in a select group of re-insurers invited to play on unique market opportunities. In the mortgage reinsurance markets, we remain a leader with a robust in-force mortgage book and significant future opportunities. With improved loan underwriting practices by lenders since the financial crisis, loss expectations remain muted in the near-term. However, we remained watchful of potentially destabilizing macroeconomic forces and/or heightened competition and will manage our portfolio accordingly. We are pleased with our progress at building a better positioned, meaningfully larger and more diversified global reinsurance portfolio. We remain confident that we can execute in a market that is transforming at an accelerated rate, whether it be from third-party capital, M&A consolidation, evolving distribution channels or rapid technology change and disruption. With that backdrop of fast-paced change, Everest Re will continue to differentiate itself with global breadth of capabilities across all P&C lines, meaningful and relevant capacity supported by alternative capital through Mt. Logan, cat bonds, traditional and non-traditional hedges, evolving and innovative capital structures, all allowing us to maximize the value proposition to our customers while enhancing returns to Everest shareholders, creative product structuring to deliver customized risk transfer and risk financing solutions for our clients, and expense efficiency and nimble execution via our flat and lean organization, allowing us to capture more dollars of margin for each dollar of premium than most of our competitors. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jon Zaffino : Thanks, John and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered a solid quarter of performance. We are encouraged by our steady improvement and the progress we are making toward our key goals. Prominent among these goals are diversified and profitable growth and increased resilience across our in-force portfolios and operating platforms. Our team has done an outstanding job executing on the plan and building upon the many foundational pieces we have put in place over the past 3 years. The second quarter brought some notable performance highlights beginning with the highest level of quarterly gross written premium, net written premium and net earned premium realized in our insurance operation history. It further marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our business. This achievement is the result of highly diversified growth across our property and casualty and accident and health operations, our growing geographic reach and our consistently evolving product capabilities. It also speaks to our increasing relevance within the specialty insurance market. This quarter\u2019s results are also encouraging considering our two largest underwriting divisions by gross written premium in the quarter. Everest Underwriting Partners and our U.S. property group experienced notable declines in their premium production due to various deliberate underwriting actions. Importantly, this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $22 million, a more than twofold increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit is $9.5 million, a 3x increase over 2017 second quarter and $37 million more than our 2016 2Q performance. Further, five of the last six quarters have produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the third quarter of 2017, where we along with the rest of the industry felt the impact of unprecedented cat activity. We are encouraged, but not surprised to see our profitability increasing as we expand our specialty product premium writings along with our top line results. An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry leading talent across our expanding global platform. Everest Insurance remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals across a range of disciplines. In fact, more than 500 colleagues have chosen to join Everest over the past 3 years. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth while ensuring we have the right people in place to support our expanding books of business. Notable hires this year include a new CEO of our Canadian Insurance operation, the Everest Insurance Company of Canada, a new leader of the Specialty Insurance Group, our dedicated platform in the sports, entertainment and leisure space, and a new head of our E&S Casualty operations. Each of these leaders strengthens our already deep bench of talent and are representative of the top-flight professionals joining our organization. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort, and there is room for further improvement. But there is no denying that many strategic actions we have taken since 2015 are beginning to take hold and evidence themselves in our underlying results. Turning to the financial results for the second quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $646 million in gross written premium, an increase of $77 million or 13% over second quarter 2017. Adjusting for a second quarter 2017 renewal rights deal that enhanced our wholesale property platform, gross written premium growth improves to 17%. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to $1.2 billion, a $147 million or 15% increase over the same period of 2017. Adjusting for the renewal rights deal, first half gross written premium growth also comes in at 17%. Again, gross written premium for the second quarter represents the single largest quarter of production in our history and showed a 96% increase over 2Q 2015, nearly doubling our production from when we started this transformation just 3 short years ago. The significant addition of new products, which continue to gain scale, coupled with strong performance from our many existing product areas, contributed to this excellent result. 9 of our 11 major business segments showed year-over-year growth in the first half, while our line of business mix remained generally stable, with roughly 40% of our premium written in short-tail classes and the remainder in our specialty and casualty line. Our net written premium growth, while still a healthy 6% year-to-date over the comparable period of 2017 was impacted by two notable items. First was the previously discussed 2Q \u201817 renewal rights deal, which included a one-time transfer of unearned premium in that quarter. If we exclude this one-time item, net written premium growth improves to 8% for the first half. Further impacting net written premium growth are additional hedges we have implemented for our wholesale and retail property portfolios, which included a one-time cession related to a new quota share placement incepted on April of this year. Net earned premium in the quarter was $408 million, an increase of $45 million or 12%. Year-to-date, net earned premium increased by $114 million or 17% over the prior period to $802 million. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various new business ventures incepted over the past 3 years begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate. Turning to the combined ratio for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.7%, a 140 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.3%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter and year-to-date period, are 95.4% and 96.6%, respectively. This represents a 1.8% increase over 2017\u2019s second quarter of 93.6% and a 90 basis point increase over 2017\u2019s year-to-date result of 95.7%. Last year\u2019s second quarter attritional combined ratio had a one-time benefit from an adjustment to our A&H portfolio, which accounts for the majority of the 90 basis point increase in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. This quarter\u2019s loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 1.6% from the prior year period to 68.7% from 70.3%. This includes 2.6 points of cat activity in the current quarter related to late winter storms in the U.S. This compares favorably to the 3.6 points of cat activity in 2Q \u201817. The second quarter \u201818 attritional loss ratio increased 1.5% to 66.3% from 64.8% in 2Q \u201817. However, on a year-to-date basis, the 2018 attritional loss ratio of 66.2% remains very stable and, in fact, it is flat compared to the first half of \u201817. Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter as we take advantage of our improved scale to continue our investment in people and technology. Our expense ratio in the second quarter was 29%, down from the first quarter result of 31.9% and essentially flat from 2Q 2017. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 30.5%, up a 100 basis points from the 29.5% in the comparable period of 2017. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio to stabilize as we continue on our growth path and as earned premium continues to come through in the second half of the year. As we\u2019ve stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment. I want to spend a few minutes on the rate environment and share some observations with regards to pricing. Overall, I will break this down into 3 areas. First, we see some encouraging trends in parts of our U.S. property and commercial auto books, for example. Second, we are encouraged by some gradually improving lines of business such as primary general liability and various professional lines. And third there remains some areas under a higher degree of rate pressure, namely U.S. workers\u2019 compensation, which we will continue to closely monitor. Overall, excluding workers\u2019 compensation, Everest Insurance produced an aggregate rate change of plus 5.8% in the second quarter, which is the strongest rate change we have seen since the second quarter of 2012, a 6-year high. Further, this continues an upward trend in non-workers\u2019 compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. As for the encouraging areas, commercial auto was up 14% for the quarter and 13.1% year-to-date. Property rates increased 13.1% for the quarter and 12.6% year-to-date. Commercial auto has been on an upward trend over many quarters, and for property, the second quarter was the fourth in a row of growing rate increases. As for lines showing steady rate improvement, primary general liability is gaining momentum and the quarter\u2019s plus 3.2% change is more than double the rate increase we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Further, the second quarter marks the sixth quarter of the last 7 in positive rate change territory for this line. As with respect to various professional lines, we continue to experience moderate rate pressure, although overall rates appear to be bottoming out, coming in near flat for the quarter. Workers\u2019 compensation, despite coming under persistent rate pressure, continues to perform well and in line with our view of loss experience across our portfolio. As stated previously, we remain encouraged by the profitability of this line of business, and we\u2019ll carefully monitor rate and loss cost trends in the coming quarters. Some concluding comments. Stated simply, the momentum across our global specialty insurance operation continues. Strong premium growth and increasing profitability are being achieved alongside continued investments in talent, technology and operating platforms. We have built an adaptive, resilient and relevant specialty insurance organization that we continue to grow, guided by our number one priority of profitable, sustainable growth. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to you next quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Todd for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Thank you. In your prepared remarks, you spoke about what you got wrong on the cat losses last year and suggesting you have you have under-priced loss adjustment expenses. So, is the book of business you have in cat today under-priced relative to what you should have priced that at January 1? John Doucette : Good morning, Josh. It\u2019s John. Thanks for the question. I would not characterize it that way and we always are continuing to evaluate loss trends and factors that go into our pricing. And really, it was a function of the loss adjustment expenses that happened in totality when the multiple events happened, but we do look at and have modified our loss adjustment expenses going forward and we did going into this renewal season at 6/1. Josh Shanker : Did that change the competitiveness about how you could participate? Did you find that your business was better except for that 1/1 than at 6/1? John Doucette : I think there is a lot of countervailing occurrence that are happening. And at 1/1, that\u2019s more of a different market. 6/1 is Florida and there is a lot more territories at 1/1. So I think there are a lot of moving parts, including some of the capital. I think there was more macro overarching supply demand as we headed into 6/1. There is a lot of moving parts that are there. With did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did write more on deals that we liked and wrote \u2013 declined several deals or reduced the share of deals that we didn\u2019t like and some of that was pricing, some of that was what we thought the right kind of either an agreement or disagreement on what the price equilibrium should be for losses that happened or losses to particular layers, so either by region or to a client or to a layer and what we thought the price equilibrium should be for that. So, it was more than usual churn in the portfolio this Florida season than we had seen, but we were in the end pleased with our ability to deploy the capital, supporting the clients that we wanted to support. We also wrote more proportional business as we indicated both in casualty and in property. Dom Addesso : Josh, these multiple events also had \u2013 because they were multiple events, had a disproportionate impact on our retro add book. And as a result of pricing demand that we had back in January 1 we actually have less exposure there than we did in the previous year. Go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yes. If you think about your outwards reinsurance book, I think that in retrospect, you wish you had certain kinds of protection, particularly around LAE that you didn\u2019t have coming into this year. Do you feel well protected on your outwards reinsurance book this year or does it carry with the same risks that befell you in 2017? Dom Addesso : First of all, big portion of our outwards book is through Mt. Logan, which is proportional as well as some facultative specific deals, which again are for the most part proportional. So, those are not affected. Our cat bonds, which frankly make up the bulk of our protections beyond Mt. Logan, are really intended to be protected against capital events, not earnings events. So, we still feel very comfortable with our cat load that we profess to be under 9% and that our protections are the same or better. Josh Shanker : Alright. Well, I will see the floor to other questions. Dom Addesso : Thank you. John Doucette : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. So my first question just trying to get a bit more color on the increase to losses for 2017. So, you guys mentioned part of it was related to the AOB issue in Florida. We have seen that going on in the state with a bunch of the homeowner insurers for sometime. So in retrospect, I mean, maybe are you a little bit less surprised that this happened, just a little bit more color there? And then my second question would be, I don\u2019t know, if it\u2019s IBNR that you can disclose in relation to how you are carrying for these events or some other metric I guess. So we would expect we can kind of look to a number and say this has been fully addressed and we don\u2019t expect any additional movement from here? Dom Addesso : I will ask Craig to address the IBNR question, but relative to the AOB, the AOB issue was not the AOB per se, it was the threat of AOB that we think was driving the number of reopens. So again to be clear what we were seeing as increases were due to reopens not as it relates specifically to AOB. Craig, on the IBNR question? Craig Howie : Elyse, on the IBNR, we believe that we have put up adequate IBNR and when we went through these calculations for these catastrophe events, our goal was to put this issue behind us. And so we believe the IBNR that we hold for all our cat events and that\u2019s separate from our non-catastrophe reserves is adequate to cover in any and all prior year cat. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question maybe this ties back to a little bit of what Josh was asking, but if we look at your losses following on this quarter\u2019s increase as a percent of equity, you do stand above your peers following this increase. So in retrospect, as you think back were you carrying too much risk, two to three storms? And I guess as you have you did mention writing less aggregate retro this year. So do you think given that the increase happened kind of right around the midyear renewals were taking place, do you think that you were able to kind of see it in time to make enough adjustments to the book you are carrying into this year\u2019s wind season? Dom Addesso : Right. So in response to your first question, I will take a little bit of \u2013 I slightly disagree with characterizing it as above our peers. It\u2019s frankly more in line. We manage our cat exposure as you know on an after-tax basis as do many others, but most others aren\u2019t being in Bermuda, don\u2019t have some of the same advantages from our tax structure that we do. So frankly, we consider it on that basis. And again given our capital position, given what I mentioned in my script, was that again over the last 5 years, our overall cat portfolio has been extremely profitable at generating over $3.5 billion of profits in that 5-year time period as well as I think if you look at our operating ROE compared to our peers, I think you will find that we lead the group there as well. So, the answer to your question relative to tax is we manage our cat exposure at less than 9 points of combined ratio points on an annual expected basis. And frankly over the last 5 years or 10 years, it\u2019s actually proven to come in right in around that number. So we think we have kind of optimized our portfolio. The fact that we write a lot more retro and retro ag than most other participants again because of our size and our scale can lead to a little bit more volatility, but again we think that that\u2019s come with the appropriate returns. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but... Elyse Greenspan : Yes, that does. And then one last question moving away from the cat increase, the current accident year results were pretty strong in reinsurance in the quarter. In the prepared remarks I believe you said 2 points was from non-cat weather. You showed about a 5 point improvement in your accident year loss ratio in reinsurance in the quarter, which did stand out as you commented just given the shift to pro rata and casualty business. So is that as you think going forward is that a level of improvement that can be sustained or were there some other one-timers in the quarter or should we just look to the half year number as representative of the underlying margin improvement we could see? Dom Addesso : I always prefer to look at a half year number, because any one quarter can have a fair bit of volatility in it, but I think the half year number is fairly reflective of kind of what we expect going forward recognizing of course that it was positively impacted by the non-cat \u2013 the scarcity of non-cat cat events, which is frankly has not occurred for a number of years. You might recall last year, it was for both primary companies and re-insurers, there was a lot of storm activity in the first half of the year that didn\u2019t reach the level of, in our case, $10 million per event, so we call them non-cat cats. But recognizing that difference, depending on how you would like to account for that in your models again in the 6 month numbers would be more reflective of how we see the portfolio. John Doucette : And Elyse, good morning, it\u2019s John. I\u2019d just add a little more color on the portfolio so we did see rate increases at different points in time this renewal season post the events again, we talked about it at 1/1 was it as much as we were hoping for now but we did see rate increases at 1/1, 4/1, 6/1 and 7/1, and that is going to have some impact in the numbers you\u2019re looking at we also as we continue to build out our mortgage and credit portfolio, that has run to an attractive combined ratio and there is a lot of other things I talked about the global clients and the strategic relationship we are building with some of those, also has run favorably so there is a lot of moving parts but again, just to reiterate from the prepared comments, we really believe that our overall portfolio, our U.S. international casualty, professional, property, mortgage, structured is better positioned today that we\u2019ve been able to get rate in some places but also position the portfolio and build some stronger portfolio overall that will impact that has impacted the attritional combined ratio. Dom Addesso : To further add to that, John mentioned in his prepared comments about, as well, a low combined ratio line expansion in or growth in trade credit political risk and surety again, we have, over a number of quarters now, worked hard to diversify our portfolio not only by product and class of business but also geographically and I think that if you look at the underlying metrics, you\u2019ll find that we\u2019ve achieved a lot of that success and that\u2019s, in part, what\u2019s driving down what historically had been a much higher annual expected cat load, driving that down below 9%, notwithstanding the fact that, yes, we have these events in \u201817, but again, given the fact that we have a retro book that, in retrospect, was not \u2013 it was not a surprising effort. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much for all the color. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. My first question on the reinsurance front, so Everest, I\u2019d say is probably a little bit of an outlier in terms of the strong growth in net premiums written that we have seen and that growth has accelerated this quarter. John, I know you said that this growth was broad, but I am just curious are there any particular notable deals that drove this particularly strong growth this quarter and are you seeing the ceding commissions or the ceding rates relatively stable? John Doucette : Good morning, Yaron. Thanks for the question. So, we are \u2013 so a couple of things. So I mentioned the global clients and so the large, the top 15 or so multinational insurers, we see them coming back, I would say, the pendulum when we have talked about this over the last several earnings calls or years, where they were retaining more, centralizing their ceded, re-globalizing their treaties and sometimes that worked for them on a pro forma basis and sometimes, it didn\u2019t \u2013 maybe it didn\u2019t work as well on some of the classes of business with some of the volatility they wanted and we do see that there seems to be as the pendulum seems to be moving a little bit in the other direction that they are potentially ceding more. And that is a disproportionate advantage to Everest, because they have very strong type reinsurance security committees they want to trade with people in basically all lines of business, not just property they want to trade with re-insurers in all lines of business, and they want to trade with them around the world and given our broad portfolio and experienced underwriters that are situated in all the major markets, hubs around the world, we have that ability to trade with the global re-insurers locally as well as holistically at a corporate level and that is driving not all, but it\u2019s driving some of it we are also seeing continued opportunities in the mortgage space and frankly, we are seeing other clients coming to the market with casualty and professional reinsurance treaties in a way that we haven\u2019t seen the last couple of years so we had been bearish on the casualty space for many years and ahead of our peers on decreasing as the ceding commissions went up, and we didn\u2019t like the trade as much or the strategic positioning of that and we are directionally moving increasing our capacity to that space as we do see more favorable dynamics for us to allow us to support casualty and professional treaties and again, we do have some strategic relationships there, not just with the global clients, that are resulting in some meaningful premium opportunities and you asked about the ceding commissions we are seeing, in some cases, the ceding commissions coming down there\u2019s been a lot of talk about that, that maybe if property can\u2019t subsidize other lines of business, that other lines of business will have to stand more on their own so at 1/1, we were pleased with that, and we continue to see some favorable movement on ceding commissions across our long tail book of business. Yaron Kinar : That\u2019s helpful. And just to clarify the increased use of your services and your balance sheet by the global clients, that\u2019s coming that\u2019s broad based or is it coming from a concentrated number of clients? John Doucette : So, we trade basically with all of them, the top 14, 15, 16 of them, but it varies, where some of them, we trade a lot more and part of that\u2019s their cession strategy, their reinsurance strategy on how where they are in that thought process part of it is long-term relationships that we\u2019ve developed with them part of it is where they\u2019re situated so there is a lot of moving parts, but we do trade with all of them but what we are seeing is our ability that when they come to the market, they would come and talk to Everest they will come and talk to a few other large global re-insurers, but they won\u2019t necessarily talk to a broad reinsurance panel and again, that is disproportionately impacting favorably our ability to grow the book and diversify the book. Dom Addesso : Our growth with these global clients, for most of those relationships, the total volume has grown not all, but so we can\u2019t if you\u2019re trying to get to is there are small handful, it\u2019s across the spectrum, no. Yaron Kinar : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the insurance side, I guess given that net premiums earned are up over 15% in the first half of the year, why would the expense ratio deteriorate year-over-year? Jon Zaffino : Good morning. This is Jon. I think you are going to see some movement in any discrete quarter based on the timing of our hiring effort, the timing of various investments in technology I think what we are aiming for is again as I said in my prepared remarks that 30% level is quite competitive but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts as we continue to expand geographically in various lines of business and make various investments so that\u2019s part of it we look at the on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s trending the right way and we also looked at it compared to first quarter, which obviously was a nice improvement. So we are pretty comfortable with where that\u2019s been. Yaron Kinar : Great. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning and thanks for the color. I have three follow-up questions to the loss development discussion. Number one, just going back I guess in your opening remarks, you outlined two reasons for the loss development two other companies in our universe talked about the same reasons yet they actually released reserves from 2017 events how can we as outsiders reconcile these two things in which Everest is an outlier? Dom Addesso : Well, I mean, I can\u2019t speak to what their process is, and I think I\u2019ve already suggested that we have to make some changes in the way we look at these things and I\u2019ll point back to and I can\u2019t speak to what the circumstances were in these two companies, some of which, by the way, we may have supported on the retro side and didn\u2019t see losses from them until the second quarter. So that\u2019s kind of an interesting sidebar, but we were disproportionately impacted by our retro ag book, which by definition is going to be late record and I think overall, I can\u2019t speak to what they\u2019ve done versus what we\u2019ve done, but we know we have to make changes to how we address these multiple events going forward I will also point to the fact that you might recall that in the weeks following and the months following these events, that widespread press reports of claims being closed, the events were not as large as was expected so there was some market chatter, if you will, that wasn\u2019t setting off any alarm bells for us and clearly, in retrospect, that was a mistake, and we had readily admitted that but for sure, the loss itself is certainly contained within our capabilities, within our earnings our long-term track record is still intact and when you go back and push this event back into \u201817, I still submit to you that our operating returns were better than all of our peers. Amit Kumar : Fair point. I guess it\u2019s just relating to that answer can we have some comfort or how much limit is left in this cover, which you were referring to and how will this respond if there is any additional development? Dom Addesso : I\u2019ll ask Craig or John to. Craig Howie : So Amit, as we went through this from the ground up, we did look at the aggregate covers that had losses submitted on them, and we know what those limits are that remain on those covers but what we really did from a modeling standpoint and going to the underlying underwriters was try to find out what other aggregate covers have we written where we haven\u2019t seen a loss selection yet, and we are trying to extrapolate that across our portfolio so that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our additional loss estimate for these events. Amit Kumar : Got it. The third and final question it\u2019s been a few years since we have discussed models and their efficacy I know in the past, I think you have mentioned using an AIR model any thoughts on AIR versus RMS and even any cost of changing the models that you use? Thank you. John Doucette : Hi, good morning Amit, it\u2019s John. So look, we are well aware of limitations of the models and that these are tools and one of the things that go into how we underwrite, how we price and how we reserve and there were many examples during not just the 2017 events but events prior to that, that showed model misses from the major vendors, and that happened multiple times, including during the 2017 events, with orders of magnitude missed so we agree with you that the models are a tool and need to be thought that way, and so we rely we look at the models, but we rely on first principles as well as underwriting who the clients are we want to support, what do we think of their underwriting, what do we think of our positioning with them, how they trade forward, how they treat reinsurance and/or retro writers and we think that allows us to both build a profitable book of business as well as build a sustainable, competitive franchise with clients that we have around the world. Amit Kumar : But you still use the AIR model, right? John Doucette : Yes, we use AIR. We also look at RMS. We look at other a lot of AIR and RMS haven\u2019t developed in some of the more developed developing countries, and we looked at local models we try to look at all data sources, all modeling, all vendor models that we can to determine what we think is Everest to a risk. Amit Kumar : Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Amit. I have got \u2013 I think we are running over and we are more than happy to stay on, because we have got a number of other people in queue. So, next caller? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. My first question is on the current quarter, second quarter catastrophe losses $65 million seems to be higher than your pre-announcement 2 weeks ago, just want to clarify that? Craig Howie : So Kai, this is Craig. We pre-announced a net after-tax number, and that number was net of other current year weather related losses so as you heard us talk about, we were able to lower our loss selection on the reinsurance side for non-cat losses, if you will, anything below $10 million we were able to lower that loss selection because we didn\u2019t have many events during the first half of the year that were indicating reinsurance exposure so that\u2019s what was offsetting that $65 million, and then the rest is after tax to get us to the $25 million that was in the pre-release. Kai Pan : Okay. So that portion benefits your underlying core loss ratio in your reinsurance operations? Craig Howie : That\u2019s correct. It was not a cat event it was the underlying reinsurance attritional loss ratio. Kai Pan : Great. My second question, on the insurance side it looks like if you take out adjustments a year ago, it\u2019s pretty flat in terms of combined ratio, underlying combined ratio given the business growing and still probably not up to the goal of mid-90s combined ratio yet, so do you think there\u2019s room for further improvement towards that goal and how quickly you can get there? Jon Zaffino : Hi, Kai, it\u2019s Jon. Good morning. Yes, let me remember, there is two things going on in the second quarter comparative first, as I mentioned, was the renewal rights deal, which moved some things around secondly was the onetime adjustment for our A&H book so achieving the flat both loss and combined on an attritional basis, that feels like we\u2019re directionally moving the right way considering some of the deliberate underwriting actions we took throughout the first half of the year and actually, candidly, we have for the prior couple of years we expect that momentum to continue for instance, some of our newer businesses, which we think have very, very favorable risk-return characteristics, were about a third of our premium writings in the quarter that\u2019s an all-time high from the inception of each of these so as that continues to earn through, we do expect further improvement again you might get some movement in any discrete quarter based on various movements across the book, but overall, we still think there\u2019s room for improvement. Dom Addesso : To add to that, Kai, we have some of our newer lines of business, longer earning periods, whether it\u2019s surety, trade credit, political risk, transaction risks and those portfolios are beginning to build, and the earned premium is growing proportionally there and those are very low combined ratio classes. Kai Pan : Okay, great. Last one, if I may. On the buybacks and it looks like you resumed buyback, $25 million in the quarter I assume that\u2019s before you know this loss revision in 2017 events I just wonder what\u2019s your thought process behind it and now you\u2019ve started trading below 1.1x book. Will you be more aggressive in buying back your own shares even during the wind season? Dom Addesso : It was a very attractive price. Kai Pan : Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Kai. Operator : Thank you. We will take our last question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Two quick ones. I think first of all in reinsurance, was there any change in the accident year loss pick for casualty and specialty lines from the first quarter to the second quarter? Craig Howie : There was always movement, Meyer, with respect to loss picks throughout the quarter we constantly look at, we hold reserve committees at the end of each quarter as part of that process, we do that both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, but as we go through that process, we look at everything, we look at rate change up or down, we look at loss cost trend up or down, but there is constant movement in those expected loss ratios in any given quarter where the movements this quarter. The answer is yes, slight movements only. Dom Addesso : But nothing material, and some of that has to reflect the fact that we had some newer business coming into that line so it has to be reflective of the business that we\u2019re now putting on the books but generally, it\u2019s been pretty stable. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. So in the past few years, you have had phenomenal aggregate reserve development generally concentrated in the fourth quarter I know this is sort of an unrealistic question, but should we assume that some of the second quarter reserve releases came out of what we would normally see in the fourth quarter as a function of conservative reserving? Dom Addesso : Well, part of the answer to that question and it\u2019s not a ridiculous question, the reserve studies that we had done this time are the same reserve studies that we do every time for this kind of year typically, those reserve studies, because they are smaller lines of businesses, don\u2019t produce these kinds of results, which and therefore they are not material. And therefore sometimes \u2013 if they are material, they get booked. If they are not material, then we wait for the fourth quarter. So this time around, we have some relatively smaller lines of business or classes of business that produced pretty favorable number obviously. And so obviously I don\u2019t know the answer to your question, because we haven\u2019t done the year end reserve studies yet, but typically you wouldn\u2019t expect this level of releases from the lines of businesses that were under review and therefore you wouldn\u2019t expect these lines of business to have contributed that much to the year end reserve releases. Is that helpful at all? Meyer Shields : It is, yes. Very much so. And I guess just a final follow-up, is there any sense of the change in \u2013 or any quantification of the losses ceded to Mt. Logan because of the reserve shift? Craig Howie : Could you say that again? What was that? Meyer Shields : Yes, I am sorry. The magnitude of the change in 2017 tax free losses that were ceded to Mt. Logan? John Doucette : Yes. So, this is John. So, the short answer is yes. As indicated previously, Mt. Logan participates on basically quota shares of layers and portfolios of business that Everest writes and consequently, the cession to Mt. Logan grew particularly \u2013 grew accordingly with the increase in the loss picks that Everest put forth. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. John Doucette : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That ends our questions for today. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Todd and thanks to all for your questions today. I hope you came away with a better understanding of the circumstances regarding our reserve change. But nevertheless, as we look back at the portfolio and our business model, we remain very confident that our underwriting strategy is solid. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s evidenced by our 5-year average operating ROE through 2017, which after adjustment for the cat losses was 11.8%. This is better than each of the companies in our peer group and I think it\u2019s worth emphasizing. Cat business is volatile. But as I pointed out, it\u2019s profitable through the cycle and again as I mentioned previously, it\u2019s less than 9 combined ratio points on average through those same 5 years. But what I really \u2013 I think the message we want to leave you with is the understanding of the breadth of our entire business model. And over the last couple of years, we have succeeded in lessening our cat exposure by diversifying our reinsurance portfolio and the credit, other specialty classes along with as John talked about, the resurgence in our casualty lines of business. And as a consequence, the attrition results continue to improve. Furthermore, the organic build of our insurance operation has been noteworthy. We now have profitable specialty insurance operation expected to exceed over $2 billion in premium. That\u2019s double from 3 years ago. I recognized in the short-term that it maybe very natural to look at the current results in this business that can be sometimes misleading. And if you more closely examine the underlying metrics, I think you will find and get a better sense of what the future holds for Everest. So, we believe it\u2019s a bright one. Thank you very much for your interest this morning. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the day.",

LLC Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group\u2019s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. On the call today are Dom Addesso, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, President and CEO of Reinsurance Operations; and Jon Zaffino, President and CEO of Insurance Operations. Before we begin, please note, the Company\u2019s SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, statements made during today\u2019s call which are forward-looking in nature, such as statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations. The SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection with such statements. Now, let me turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dominic Addesso : Thank you. Good morning. Last night, we released earnings per share of $5.02 for the third quarter. Despite the number of catastrophes for the industry in the quarter, this turned out to be a quarter for us with a solid ROE. This result reflects a strong quarter for investment income, continued strong underwriting income from attritional results and tax benefits achieved from our portfolio of composition. These factors, coupled with a positive equity market resulting in realized gains for the quarter, produced 9.7% annualized net income ROE for the quarter. No doubt that it has been an active last 15 months for cat losses, and of course, one more quarter to go with already some known cats. Well it's been challenging for those individuals and businesses directly impacted by these events. These are challenges to which we have responded well and in fact better than most. Over that time, we continued to produce positive results and we anticipate the same in the fourth quarter. Our portfolio composition is able to absorb volatility and over the longer-term, including these recent years, has produced total shareholder return of over 12%. On an ROE basis, over the last five years, Everest has outperformed by approximately 300 basis points, a top 20 peers listing as compiled by A. M. Best. Nevertheless, we must always look forward. And as all of us recognized, there are significant questions which persist around our industry, most notably, the influx of third-party capital and price adequacy. That is why you may have observed that over time, our net annual expected cat load has drifted down from over 12 combined ratio points to currently less than 9, and will likely drift down into next year. This has been and will continue to be the result of deliberate execution of our strategy, a combination of reducing and diversifying our cat portfolio and diversifying into other segments of the business. You will hear more about this from my colleagues. We continue to believe the future is bright for Everest given the scale we have on the business and our breadth of underwriting and capital management capabilities. And therefore the ability to leverage that into the better opportunities, the market offers and to participate meaningfully in new classes and constructs. We see the recent catastrophe events as being a strong proof point of our value proposition and this along with our clients focus on earnings volatility, has continuing to increase demand for our products and services. Thank you for your participation this morning, and I look forward to our dialogue during the Q&A. I'll now turn it over to Craig for detailed financial results. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had net income of $206 million for the third quarter of 2018. This compares to a net loss of $639 million for the third quarter last year, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $486 million compared to a net loss of $102 million for the first nine months of 2017. Net income year-to-date included $35 million of net after tax realized capital gains compared to $79 million of capital gains in the first nine months of 2017. The capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. After tax operating income for the third quarter was $167 million compared to a loss of $624 million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $428 million compared to a loss of $123 million for the first nine months of 2017. The group recorded a modest underwriting gain of $278,000 for the third quarter essentially a breakeven result with a 100% combined ratio. This compared to an underwriting loss of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 with the combined ratio of 164%. The year-to-date underwriting gain for the group was $21 million compared to an underwriting loss $705 million for the same period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio was 99.6% compared to 116.5% reported for the first nine months of 2017 reflecting the higher catastrophe losses in 2017. These results reflect the series of major catastrophe events that are driving both the quarter and the year-to-date figures for both 2017 and 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, the group saw $240 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017. The breakdown of the pretax loss estimates by event is as follows : Hurricane Florence was $90 million. Typhoon Jebi was $80 million. Typhoon Trami was $25 million. The 2018 California wildfires were $25 million, and the Japan floods were $20 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $837 million in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 85.8% through the first nine months compared to 85.6% for the same period in 2017. Our year-to-date group expense ratio remains low at 5.7%, while our commission ratio of 22.1% remains relatively stable. When looking at year-over-year comparisons, it should be noted that the 2017 commission and expense ratios benefited from higher reinstatement premiums arising from the 2017 catastrophe events. For investments, pretax investment income was $161 million for the quarter and $441 million year-to-date on our $18.7 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $47 million or 12% from one-year ago. This result continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $29 million from the first nine months of 2017. However, $13 million of the limited partnership income this quarter came from a distribution of one investment and will not reoccur in the future. The pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.0% one-year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year. The new money rates are now in excess of our total portfolio yield. This will boost future net investment income. On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded was the result of the amount and geographic region of the losses associated with the catastrophes. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. We expect to report a tax benefit for the full-year since additional catastrophe losses are anticipated in the fourth quarter. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $544 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to $1 billion in 2017. The year-over-year decline reflects a higher level of paid catastrophe losses in 2018 from the 2017 catastrophe events. Shareholders' equity for the Group was $8.3 billion at the end of the third quarter and was essentially flat compared to year-end 2017. The $40 million slight decline in year-to-date shareholder's equity is primarily attributable to the $255 million mark-to market impact on the investment portfolio and capital return for $159 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks offset by $486 million of net income. As a result of the share buybacks and dividends, the Company has returned 48% of net income to shareholders to date in 2018. The Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2018 have had no impact on our strong capital position. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance Operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Everest Re continues to focus on relevance to our customers, global spread and line of business diversity in our expanding portfolio and proactive and efficient use of our capital. Our strategy is focused on long-term profitable growth, sustainability and responsiveness to our clients and brokers. We are built to withstand the volatility that we manage for our clients, whether that is from increased frequency of property catastrophes, short losses and casualty, and professional liability classes, credit risk, mortgage risk, or any other risks needing mitigation. Although we manage volatile risks, we are disciplined and thoughtful underwriters, expanding our business by offering tailored products and solutions across our global underwriting platform and in all property and casualty lines. In Q3 of 2018, we had $240 million of losses, net of reinsurance from the events in the U.S. and Japan. This continued frequency of catastrophe losses has put upward pressure on rates and as a core reinsurer, we are positioned to capture the benefits of any market uplift. That being said, the cumulative compression of property margins over the last several years has had the corresponding impact of stabilizing the casualty reinsurance market and some other non-property lines of business, which can no longer rely on rate subsidization from the property cat lines of business. Overall, we have correspondingly deployed more capital across many long-tailed and short-tailed line, which exclude cat exposure, highlighted by our underwriting profit from non-cat exposed classes, reaching $190 million through nine months in 2018, up $70 million over the same period last year from similar lines of business. Recognizing this improving market dynamic for non-cat exposed lines, we targeted inbound several large casualty treaties this year at attractive ROEs. And we know that several more new casualty treaties are coming to the market soon, both from large global clients and smaller regional companies, which could continue to improve overall reinsurance terms going forward and expand the opportunity set to profitably deploy capital. Similarly, we are viewed as a premier and disciplined reinsurance partner in the expanding mortgage space as well as in specialty lines and structured reinsurance products and continue to see new opportunities in these lines. As I have said before, this new paradigm of capital restructuring in SureTec and technology innovation, and other disruptive forces impacting our industry. Collectively, we'll continue to test all insurers and reinsurers, and only those such as Everest with our longstanding global franchise, an access to profitable diversified business through an efficient operating platform will continue to thrive in this new world. Now, I will turn to our quarterly and year-to-date results. In Q3 2018, overall the reinsurance division grew gross written premiums year-over-year by 7% to $1.7 billion. When removing effects of foreign exchange and reinstatement premiums last Q3 due to the catastrophes, it is up 18%, primarily due to increases in both property and casualty quota share business. Our overall Q3 combined ratio was 100.1%. This breakeven underwriting result was driven by an elevated cat loss ratio of 17.4%, primarily due to Hurricane Florence, California, Wildfires, Typhoons Jebi and Trami, and the Japanese floods. Year-to-date, our gross written premium were up 20% to $4.5 billion. And the overall combined ratio was 100.1%, which includes all cat losses incurred during the year. As pro rata business has become more attractive due to a combination of better original insurance rates in certain lines and improving ceding commissions and other reinsurance terms. Our business mix includes more pro rata than in prior years. Pro rata typically carries less volatility than excess of loss business, but offset by higher ratios. This is highlighted by our property pro rata premium contributing roughly half of the premium growth this year, but with tightly controlled limits including low occurrence limits as a percentage of premiums. Additionally, casualty quota share and other non-property quota share lines also accounted for roughly half of the premium growth seeing this year. Notably, our attritional loss and combine ratios were only up slightly to 55.1% and 82.3% respectively. We also closed more deals in credit structured reinsurance and the mortgage reinsurance space, allowing profitable capital deployment, facilitating premium growth. And we believe that we have a solid runway in front of us. In these respective areas to continue to grow and profitably diversify our writings in non-cat exposed lines of business over the coming years and therefore we would expect to see continued material growth in the underwriting profit margin contribution over the coming years from non-cat exposed business. As we saw the high double-digit annualized growth in underwriting profit margins so far year-to-date compared to last year in these classes. So while we saw a slight increase in attritional combined ratio percentage. Our notional dollars of underwriting profit from these lines are up and we expect this trend to continue in 2019 and beyond in these non-cat exposed lines of business. Year-to-date, the U.S. reinsurance operations had a 14% increase in gross written premium to $2.2 billion adjusting for reinstatement premiums and foreign exchange, written premium grew by 20%.. The increase in premium was driven by some large casualty quota share treaties, including capital relief deals and mortgage reinsurance writings. In addition, some large global clients purchased additional reinsurance including casualty and property pro rata, after reassessing internal risk targets following the cat events of 2017. These buyers seek reinsurers that can holistically address their reinsurance needs in multiple classes around the world. In Everest with our global footprint, was in a solid position to win attractive business. The U.S. combined ratio was elevated at 107.5% due to catastrophe losses incurred in 2018. While our attritional loss ratio improved slightly to 55%, our attritional combined ratio is up 1.6 points to 81.6% due to higher ceding commissions. But this is an exchange for tight occurrence limits and other risk mitigating features in the treaties. The Bermuda Operations grew 34% to $1.2 of gross written premium year-to-date. Zurich and London were primary contributors to this growth with increased casualty and multi-line sessions from large global clients. Expanded European Casualty and Motor Treaty business and growth and maturation of our political risk, surety, trade credit book. The loss ratio declined 16.7 points to 60.9% due to the lower amount of cat losses year-on-year. The attritional combined ratio decreased by almost one point to 87%. The international reinsurance operations also grew significantly to $1.1 billion. Gross written premium year-to-date increased by 21%. The growth included additional Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asian writings, providing Everest with broad-based international diversification. In Latin America and in the Caribbean, post the 2017 cat losses, we saw rate increases and some new additional opportunities both at 1/1/2018, but also throughout 2018 during other renewal dates for loss affected treaties. In Asia, we saw opportunities in crop and facultative business offset by a reduction in Chinese property pro rata business which we non-renewed due to deteriorating margins. The International segments combined ratio dropped to 97.7% from 133.4% in the prior year period. Year-to-date, 2018 has been affected by catastrophe losses from Jebi, Trami and the Japanese floods. However, the attritional combined ratio is essentially flat at 79.2%. Looking forward, it is too soon to tell, how exactly the market will respond to this year's losses, following the record losses of 2017 and active 2018 third quarter and most recently Hurricane Michael. However, with approximately $115 billion and claiming of market losses over the last 18 months. Retraction and dislocation across various lines in Lloyd's and other markets, outsized losses in the energy market, prior year cat development from several reinsurance clients, and shrinking casualty reserve redundancies. It is hard to see how it cannot be some upward pressure on rates heading into this major renewal season. We do not predict rates, but we plan to be able to identify, respond, and successfully execute in a variety of market conditions which may vary by line, by territory, and by product around the world. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thank you, John and good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of continued progress and solid execution. With each passing quarter, we gained traction and see growth across our various portfolios fueled by our deep specialty product set, the continued addition of talented colleagues, strength of relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are seeing a stable and resilient combined ratio aided by the maturation of the many businesses launched over the course of the past three years. As premiums continue to earn in and as we realized the impact of decisive underwriting actions taken to dampen the impact of more challenging lines of business, the overall business mix changes for the better and we see the benefits in the form of a less volatile combined ratio. Once again, we are emerging from a third quarter marked by significant cat activity, and once again, we can report that the Everest Insurance franchise has proven to be resilient, standing ready to respond to our customers' needs in the face of these natural disasters. Overall, we remain pleased with the continued growth and development of our global insurance platform. As we've shared in the past, our vision to organically build a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization that is relevant within the global specialty P&C industry is being realized. Underwriting profit for both the quarter and year-to-date period, growth and gross written premium, improvement and the attritional loss ratio and continued expense discipline is evidenced that the strategy we have defined is sound and we have the right talent on board to execute on our plan. I'll turn now to the financial highlights in the quarter. Following this, I\u2019ll provide brief comments on the cat activity experience within the insurance operations along with our views of the operating environment forward. For the third quarter of 2018, the global insurance operations produced $517 million in gross written premium, an increase of $37 million or 8% over third quarter 2017. Year-to-date, we achieved $1.7 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $184 million or 12% over the comparable period in 2017. These strong growth rates have been achieved despite several underwriting actions that have resulted in our controlled exit of various lines of business. As in prior quarters, contributions remain balanced across the diverse group of underwriting operations, particularly the direct broker units within the Everest Insurance global platform. This also represents the 15th consecutive quarter of growth for global insurance. Turning to net premiums, net written premium for the quarter was $385 million, and increase of $15 million or 4%. Year-to-date, net written premium was $1.2 billion, growing by $61 million or 5% over the prior year period. Net earned premium in the quarter was $419 million, an increase of $43 million or 11% and $1.2 billion year-to-date, an increase of $157 million or 15% over the prior year period. Our GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 99.6%, significantly lower than last year's quarter, which included the historic 2017 cat events. Excluding the current quarters 2.8 point of cat activity, the attritional combined ratio was 96.9%, which compares favorably to the third quarter 2017 attritional of 98% and continues a two year trend of improvement over the third quarter, 2016 attritional of 99.5%. Encouraging \u2013 and as anticipated, Everest Insurance has now produced an underwriting profit in six out of the last seven quarters. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the third quarter of this year was 66.4%, a two point improvement over last year, 68.4% and a 3.4 point improvement over 3Q 2016 of 69.8%. On a year-to-date basis, the GAAP combined ratio was 98.1% inclusive of 1.4 points of net cat loss, both delivering $23 million of underwriting profit, a $171 million improvement year-over-year. Year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the global insurance operations produced a 96.7%, essentially flat over the year-to-date 17 period yet 60 basis points below the 97.1% for the comparable period in 2016. The main variance here is the expense ratio, which came in at 30.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date periods, which was up 90 basis points and 1% respectively over the same period last year. As we've stated in prior calls, an expense ratio at roughly 30% remains very competitive in a specialty insurance segment and is in line with our plan. Importantly, the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio showed the 70 basis point improvement year-to-date, coming in at 66.3% versus the prior year period of 67%. The key point year-over-year, we are seeing a downward drift and the attritional loss ratio. This is a result of improved and mix of business, the benefits from our contingent commitment to add profitable lines of business to our portfolio and the strategic underwriting actions of the past three years. Let me offer a brief word on the third quarter cat activity. Despite an active quarter for industry cat losses are 2018 results are favorable as compared against several metrics. Everest Insurance booked at $12 million or 2.8 points net cat losses in the quarter, mainly from the impact of Florence and a smaller amount for California wildfire. The volatility from these events were well managed across our various underwriting operations. Our many underwriting actions and hedging strategies implemented over the past two years have proven effective, similar to any participants within the specialty PNC industry, we are not immune from the impacts of severe weather. However, with the growth and maturation of our platform, our ability to manage the volatility has indeed improved. Turning to the trading environment forward, the condition is exhibited in the prior quarters, remained largely unchanged. Certain lines of business continued to achieve needed positive rate, namely commercial, auto and property, and as respect property that's a common on both the attritional and cat side. Other lines of business are showing signs of improving, namely umbrella and excess. And yet other lines are showing positive rate, but not at the magnitude needed. This includes the general liability markets in many of the professional lines. Workers compensation continues to experience rate reduction as a reflection of the positive underlying fundamentals in the line. Outside of workers compensation, our composite rate increases in the quarter were at positive 4.3%, bringing our year-to-date total to a plus 4.8%. The slight decline in the quarter is as much a function of changing mix of business as it is reflective of a slowdown in rate. So in conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making in the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The nearly 90,000 submissions we have received year-to-date, speak to our relevance. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remains encouraging and hence we feel we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And I'll turn it back to Craig for Q&A. Craig Howie : Thanks Jon. Jonathan, we are ready and you can open the line for any questions that we may have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. My first question, you guys have shown pretty strong growth in your Reinsurance business, which continued in the third quarter, about 17% if you back out reinstatements, these statements from both periods. So I guess my question is do you think that this growth can be sustainable? Obviously, just assuming more or less stable kind of January 1, 2019 renewal season, because I guess more of the growth has really come from pro rata business and shifting away from cat into other casualty lines. So can we continue to see high double-digit growth from here? Dominic Addesso : Certainly into the fourth quarter as that premiums continues to earn in, you'll see those kinds of percentage. But into next year, I certainly wouldn't put that high of a growth rate on our Reinsurance business. But we still think we're entering a part of the cycle where there are opportunities emerging outside of cat. We do see increased demand from global ceding companies, we're seeing increased demand in mortgage space and opportunities there. So there are opportunities, whether or not it would reach double-digit teens into next year, that's hard to predict. But certainly we would expect to continue to see growth opportunities in the marketplace. The secondary question, of course, is whether or not those opportunities will meet our underwriting guidelines in terms of pricing, terms and condition et cetera, so it's still unknown, but perhaps a growth year into next year, but certainly we don't believe at this pace. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of margins, so you guys \u2013 the underlying loss ratio deteriorated in the third quarter. You guys kind of made the point it's due to the shifting of the mix to pro rata and casualty business. And that typically does run at higher loss ratios. The second quarter saw a little bit of a different trend, the loss ratio did improve on an underlying basis. So is it the right the way to look at year-to-date? And I guess as the mix \u2013 the business continues to earn in, in the fourth quarter into next year, would you expect I guess at year-to-date about a 50 basis points or so deterioration in your underlying commodity ratio? Dominic Addesso : So first thing is let me comment on the second quarter, just to go backwards and I want to refresh everyone's memory that the second quarter, we had a very low frequency of what we call non-cat cats. So that had a positive impact on the second quarter loss ratio. And we do think that it is more appropriate to look at the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis. And we do think that our combined ratios, frankly, on a year-to-date basis, has not changed all that much. In fact, on an attritional combined ratio, year-to-date September 2008, 85.8%, that compares against the year-to-date a year-ago of 85.6%. So two-tenths of a point movement in that, that's pretty stable, and that's kind of where we would expect it be through time, very stable. John Doucette \u2013 and it's worth reemphasizing mentioned in his remarks, the underwriting profit, I think this is why we emphasize it, sometimes can be misleading to just work from a combined ratio metrics, although we use them as well, but of course you have to use them against the right premium base. And I think that's frankly what \u2013 were some of the misses have been, there's been using the higher combined ratio, but not applying it to a higher premium base. And that's why, again, it's worth highlighting the actual notional dollars of profit that we've improved year-over-year. So this year we've had $190 million of underwriting profit from our non-cat portfolios on the reinsurance side and insurance, and last year that was $120 million. So an improvement of $70 million and sometimes when you just use the combined ratio statistics that \u2013 and you misapply the combined ratio to the wrong premium base, you miss the underwriting profit pickup. So rather a long answer to your question Elyse, but I hope that that addresses your question. Elyse Greenspan : Yes, that was very helpful. And then just one last question. Particularly for Jebi, can you just let us know what level insured losses you're using? AIR and RMS come out, you've kind of in that $2 billion to $5.5 billion range. And then further, is your exposure there mainly XOL or aggregate or both? And of industry loss estimates rose for that event as we're hearing some chatter in the market, could your net loss that you guys set up this quarter be impacted negatively? Dominic Addesso : So first our exposure to that loss is predominantly an XOL, it's not solely an XOL event. And in each of the events that Craig highlighted in his remarks, we use either the high end of the estimate, the highest end of the estimate, in some cases above the high end range from the industry estimates. Now clearly, it's still early with many of these events and we're not saying that losses can't change. Of course, they could go in either direction. But we think in the aggregate, we've done a pretty conservative job of reserving these events. There is no read across the last year because it's a much different path pattern. So we're very comfortable with the estimates. But with the absolute caveat that events can change, but even with what you've described depending on the severity of it, you think we've got that covered in large parts. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. Just first question follow-up to Elyse question on the attritional combined ratio. You mentioned the decline, mostly because of mix change to pro rata and casualty lines. I just wondered, could you comment on the pricing trends versus loss cost trend, is there any impact from that as well? Dominic Addesso : Well, as John Doucette indicated that across many of the lines of business that we entertained, particularly in the casualty space, there has been a primary space. There's been generally rate increase, and of course, Jon Zaffino highlighted that as well, of course absent a worker's comp. And when we look at, I know your comment or question, I think was focused on the reinsurance side, when we underwrite those accounts, we build in our trend. So we do have trend built into our assumptions about where the market is going. And remember that on the pro rata business, the biggest benefit that we've seen or the improvement that we've seen from a reinsurers perspective is on ceding commissions. That's just over the previous five years, ceding commissions were on the rise and it was making that portfolio not suitable to put on the books. And again it's worth reminding everyone that Everest has been \u2013 I think terrific at cycle management. We took our \u2013 half a dozen years ago, we took our casualty portfolio down to just a few $100 million, I\u2019m taking again on the reinsurance side. And of course now as market conditions have been improving, not only in primary rates, but also on ceding commission terms we've now founded suitable to reenter that space. So again, good underwriting cycle management, these are all things that we adhere to. I don't know if that answered your question. Kai Pan : That\u2019s very helpful. And could you quantify how much benefits you're getting from the reduced ceding commission? Dominic Addesso : Not specifically. Again, I'll just come to the underwriting profit numbers that I cited earlier that across all of our portfolios, that underwriting profit increased $70 million to $190 million. Kai Pan : Okay. Dominic Addesso : That\u2019s a nine-month comment, but year-to-date number. Kai Pan : Okay. My second question, on Hurricane Michael, do you have any preliminary estimates by the losses and then you can talk about relative to Florence, and also how do you approach a reserving of that? Do you see the LAE issues or AOB issues continued to be an issue as we seen in Irma? Dominic Addesso : So answer to the first question is, we don't have a reliable estimate that that we can disclose at this point. It's still early days. At this point, we've only received frankly some level of detail from only one client. Other information that we're seeing is based on model results and the process that we will go through to reserve that event will be using industry estimates, using our models, using underwriter estimates, market share and generally reserving towards the higher end of those picking the highest of those individual aspects. We do believe that from what we're hearing and observing that the event is towards the higher end of the estimates we've seen out in the street, but yet we've not been able to translate that into a loss estimate that we can put forth at this point. As far as the issues that arose in Irma, we do not think that they will be the same. Certainly the AOB threat and the carry on effect of losses will always be there. Of course in this particular case, there are more total losses than what we saw in Irma. So that theoretically should have a less \u2013 should be less of an AOB issue. The loss adjustment expense issue will be less of an issue as well, even though we will reserve that at with a market surge \u2013 demand surge a factor. Kai Pan : Okay. That's very helpful. And last one if I may, given the Michael losses and upcoming January renewals, how do you approach the buybacks that towards the year-end? Dominic Addesso : Again, we don\u2019t really telegraph buybacks. We do think we have excess capital to deploy in that space. If we think the price is appropriate, and certainly at these levels, we think it's a certainly a good value. We are obviously approaching the end of the season. So as you know, in the third quarter, we get even though we did buyback some stock. We do get a little cautious given wind season. That's coming is in our rear view mirror. So that will be potentially an opportunity. We also will look at the opportunity relative to what does occur, 1/1 as again it's been mentioned, we would anticipate that our capital going into next year we'll even be lower again. So that does decrease some of the volatility, perhaps even freeing up more capital in that regard. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you so much for all the answers. Dominic Addesso : Thank you, Kai. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : Thank and good morning. Just maybe a few follow-ups. The first question is going back little bit discussion on capital management? Are you sort of blacked out till we have a better sense of the micro loss? Dominic Addesso : That's entirely possible. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's helpful. The second question relates going back to the discussion on pricing renewals and expectations going forward. Do you get the sense of that Irma loss development, the material development for the industry? Is playing a role and will pressure pricing upwards materially for 1/1 or am I over thinking that component? Dominic Addesso : We don't think you're over thinking it. We do think that it will that does create some pressure. We've a commentary about material TBT, but I'll ask John Doucette to maybe comment that as well. John Doucette : Yes, good morning, Amit. Yes, I mean it's a combination of things of which the development there was seen by many companies for Irma, but not just Irma there was a development for a lot of reinsurance client in Maria, particularly in Puerto Rico. So I mean those are some of the things that happened, but in addition to that, we had 150 billion and growing of losses that happened. And I think that's something that needs to be factored in as well as just the reserve redundancies where do they stand? We've seen a lot of large losses like in the energy market. So there's all those, there clearly seems to be a while there's a lot of capital around there's talks on how much it's going to be stable when it comes to the alternative capital who probably a several of those players probably had two years of not great results. And so the question is not just can and will it reload. It also, I think will also be the question on what the returns and profitability targets that capital requires to come back in. So there is a lot of different things, there's the two major, major profitability reviews that are happening in Lloyd\u2019s that could affect $5 billion of renewal premium, both individual syndicates with non-performance as well as lines of business across the market that aren't performing well. I mean, that all sounds like a different macro forces that will look to potentially increased demand and have an impact on supply. And we also frankly see clients that seem to be tired of volatility. Going back to the earlier question from Elyse, that there are \u2013 we are seeing clients coming back into the market they want to a re-insurer and lock and potentially decrease their own volatility, which means there may be whether it's on the casualty or the property or the specialty side that may be an increase in the buys that happened. And that as Dom said, it's tough for us to predict what that will do when it comes to our topline. We do think that will stabilize and potentially improve pricing in certain areas. Certainly pockets that we would expect to see some improvement in pricing. Amit Kumar : That's helpful. The final question on the net investment income. The LP delta from private equity. Can you just remind us \u2013 going back to the K, just remind us, maybe just a bit more color? What exactly are these both investments in? Thanks. Dominic Addesso : The LP investments that we have are primarily in private equity and or credit. These are investments that we've made over a longer period of time. That have helped us with getting better yield on the overall portfolio. But the amount of investments that we put in place over time has been relatively consistent over the past few years. And what you've seen is, a higher level of returns from these investments over that period of time on that. Again, no major changes in our overall portfolio. Predominantly the portfolio is made up of investment grade fixed income portfolio, but we do have alternative investments not only in the limited partnerships, but also bank loans which are floating rate as well as high yield \u2013 some high yield investments as well. Our total private equity is about $1.5 billion out of our \u2013 almost $19 billion investment portfolio. So as Craig said, some of that private equity is credit related, mezzanine debt, et cetera. Amit Kumar : And is there like an additional commitment to LT investments which you have to make or is the steady state from here onwards? Dominic Addesso : We have committed funds to the private equity space that would carry out into the succeeding years, but that would not be an outsized percentage relative to how we anticipate the total investment portfolio to grow. Amit Kumar : Got it. Thank you. Dominic Addesso : So $1.5 billion would probably likely go up, but not at a disproportionate percentage to the portfolio. Right now the private equity portfolio stands at about 8%. I don't expect that to change remarkably. Amit Kumar : Got it. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Dominic Addesso : Thank you, Amit. Craig Howie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : Hey, thanks. Follow-up to Amit\u2019s question. First, the investment expenses are running $8 million or so higher year-to-date. Is that correlated with the higher alternative investment income or is that a run rate we should be thinking about? Craig Howie : Mike, this is Craig. It is in line with the investment managers that we use for some of these types of investments. And you could expect that to be at a normal run rate. Michael Zaremski : Okay, great. In the prepared remarks about U.S. reinsurance and I might be getting this little wrong. You talked about tighter limits and I know you mentioned, Dom, risk mitigation features. I think that was you Dom in a treaty. I was just curious, are you referring to a deal that the media reported earlier this fall, and maybe you can also explain what a \u2013 at a high level, what risk mitigation features means? Dominic Addesso : That was not me. That was John Doucette, and therefore I\u2019ll ask him to respond. Michael Zaremski : Sorry about that. Thanks. Dominic Addesso : Although, keep in mind that we\u2019re particularly sensitive to talking about individual clients. So with that, I'll ask John to dance through that. John Doucette : Good morning, Mike. The comment was more, I think a broader comment. It wasn't deal specific. It was really talking about on proportional business, particularly in the property space. I think that we wanted to highlight that we have \u2013 there's a lot of property quota shares that are out there and we write a few of them, we write them with clients we know and like and respect. But we also \u2013 a lot of the time, those have very tight occurrence limits, cat occurrence limits as a function of the overall premium. So while the premium growth in property went up, it doesn't correspondingly mean that there is a meaningful change in the P&L for that. That was the main point that we\u2019re trying to get to. And then beyond that, whether it's by line of business, and certainly in some of the structured areas, there will be different contract specific features, and there'll be gives and takes and different parts. And whether that's what the contract says, some swing rating, different supplements, things like that. That could happen. And that could be across basically any classes of business that we see. Back to what Dominic said at the beginning, we were more bearish than a lot of our competitors for a long time in the casualty space. And we think our view of the world for out as we cut our book tremendously. And we are seeing opportunities that we hadn't seen in awhile in the casualty space in general. Also the global clients are coming back in and they can \u2013 and that's lumpy, but they are looking for people that can trade with them in multiple classes all around the world. And we have the ability and expertise to deploy underwriting capacity in all property and casualty lines all over the world, and so we are seeing continued to see traction with the global. And again, what the contract features are will vary tremendously contract-by-contract. Dominic Addesso : By the way, and that's answer. The one other narrowing of risk mitigate features could be narrowing reinsurance, which is another thing that this is booked as an underwriting feature of many of these accounts that we put on the books. John Doucette : Meaning ensuring the insurance that our clients buy. Dominic Addesso : And we stand with them, with the protections that they get either built in actually into the contract or deemed into the contract that we will have our recovery rate that matches the \u2013 that will match the terms attachment point limit of the coverage that they buy. And we factored that into our risk assessment as we try to decide if it's an attractive deal on a risk-adjusted basis to deploy capital in that. Michael Zaremski : Okay, that's helpful. And just have follow-up on that, in terms of being less bearish on casualty \u2013 is that partly due to the new money rates being higher than the portfolio yield or is this simply due to just the non-investment income opportunities you guys are seeing? Dominic Addesso : Underwriting first, yourselves as an underwriting shop and that's the number one priority. Michael Zaremski : Okay, great. Dominic Addesso : Underwriting margin. Michael Zaremski : Okay. And lastly, I'm just curious there's been a \u2013 I'm not an expert on the mortgage insurance space, but there's been a flurry of kind of a reinsurance capital market, bonds and deals announced in recent months, or just curious, does that compete with the traditional mortgage reinsurance that you guys have been a leader in? Dominic Addesso : I'll take that one. So we write mortgage reinsurance related to the GSEs, write for the MI and we also write a little bit of mortgage reinsurance outside of North America in a couple countries that have high capital loadings such as Australia, France, potentially Germany et cetera. They were looking at that. But the predominant \u2013 our predominant mortgage book is with the GSEs and then also the MIs. So a lot of them are deploying capa \u2013 risk, are using hedging and risk mitigation strategies in at least two different capacities through traditional reinsurance, as well as through the capital market. And the GSEs in particular, have a dual mandate to use both the channels and they have a mandate to try to develop the hedging markets whether it's on the capital markets side or traditional reinsurers. And they continue to do that. So I would say net-net, it's a positive, because while they are different products, they are looking to build this out into a more sustainable class of business that. And we think the combination will do that. Michael Zaremski : Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning, everybody. I guess my first question is just thinking about cat loads. If we look at 2017s events and look at the shift in your business mix since then more into prorate, more into casualty. Do you have a sense of what the loss ratio or book value impact would have been from 2017 events? Have they occurred today? Dominic Addesso : As the 2017 events occurred today? Yaron Kinar : Yes. Dominic Addesso : Not sure I understand that meaning. Meaning, the re-underwriting of the portfolio would be impacting less. So let me answer with this way because I don't know that I have that precise answer. Our cat load not only in combined ratio points, but also in nominal dollars has been coming down over the last couple of years. Reminder that a few years ago, it was up to 12 points, now it's less than eight or less than nine, likely to be less than eight going into next year. But even in absolute \u2013 and that's partly a result of diversification of our book of business across other lines of business, but growth of the insurance, many growth of the \u2013 the different classes that John Doucette emphasize. So the diversification certainly helps that. But even in notional dollars, the number has come down. It was approaching $600 million last year. It's in the mid $500 million into this year and it will be lower than that into next year in absolute dollars. In addition, our 100 PML in all of our peaks zones is down year-over-year modestly. But that's the best I can do in terms of answering that question. I don't have a pro forma in terms of overlaying last year's events into this year's portfolio. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then you had mentioned some adverse industry development for Irma and Maria that's still ongoing. Do you \u2013 if this continues do you think there\u2019s still a risk that your loss ratios are loss picks for those events could further deteriorate? Or you now at a point that even if there is further industry deterioration, you\u2019ve kind of \u2013 you\u2019re comfortable with these reserves. John Doucette : We think that our reserve position, can withstand further industry loss deterioration. But as you say on all of these events, you never know. But we think that the way it's a reserved currently we're talking about last year's events now and even this year's events. We think that it can withstand further into \u201cindustry deterioration\u201d. Yaron Kinar : Got it. John Doucette : Okay. We heard from some clients and then we factor that into our loss fixed. So the fact that some emergency has happened more recently, that doesn't change her view per se right now. Yaron Kinar : Great. Okay. So that was already factored in the last quarter update? John Doucette : Yes. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And last question just on the casualty market and reinsurance, so if I understood your comments correctly you are a little more constructive on opportunities there today than you had been in the past? Is that more from a pricing perspective? Or is it loss cost? I guess I was just a little surprised to hear more constructive commentary there given that it seems like loss cost trends are deteriorating at least on the underlying side? John Doucette : Yes. So I mean \u2013 and there's the two worlds, the insurance world that Jon talked about and that it will vary if you want color you get on the primary side. But on the reinsurance side, there's a lot of additional moving parts right. There's the reinsurance terms conditions, what's the ceding commission, a lot of the book that we write out of the \u2013 London and Zurich is done on an excess of loss basis. So it's a little bit bifurcated from what the original rates are. So then is a rate on exposure of what we are getting and we're seeing improving opportunities on our ability to execute that. But I think in general, it's also just more a supply and demand that we see the large global clients want to do more with a company like Everest. They maybe full on some of the European reinsurers, they may \u2013 a lot of clients are tightening up their credit, their reinsurance security panel. So they are tightening the credit. So that means there's less supply for some of the long tail lines of business, the reinsurance that they want to buy. And we think that is a positive that happens. We also \u2013 one of the things that we're seeing is again, I think some of the clients who had centralized a lot of their buying, I think they are saying well, there was actually in the older \u2013 we want to take five or six, seven years and before that where there was more engagement between the reinsurance underwriters and the insurance underwriters, not just the ceded redesk of reinsurance buyers, and I think there's more feedback loop. And I think some of these insurance companies are realizing that there's real value that experienced reinsurance underwriters can add by providing insight because we see across the whole market, we see what lines of business or sub-classes are making money, are losing money, what products are making money or losing money, and it allows us to give that insight when we do underwriting audits which we do a lot of them. We underwrite our clients a lot. And I think that we are seeing the value of that as a lot of our clients are focused on their volatility, how do they improve their results. And they are looking to use reinsurance as a value proposition, not just get the lower ceding commission, but use it truer to get the better gross underwriting results Dominic Addesso : And keep one thing in mind and I recognized where your question comes from, which is really more of a beta play. Make no mistake. This is not a beta play on the market. We underwrite each individual account and client and therefore they are likely making improvements in their portfolio that could be different than what you're describing as the overall market. Yaron Kinar : Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking our last question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very much. So I've talked to Jon Zaffino in the past and you Dom about the insurance improvement situation. I think a year ago when you're talking about material improvement in the combined ratio for that business, and look, I mean being in the mid-90s, there's nothing wrong with that. But I don't know over the past nine months, have the margins \u2013 underlying margin of that business improved? I can't tell that from the numbers. And is that what your expectations were a year ago or is the turnaround slower than you thought? Dominic Addesso : I think it's just through the nine months. It\u2019s probably where I would have anticipated it to be. Remember, we've got one more quarter to go here. You've got year-end reserve that used to evaluate. In the main, it is trending and it\u2019s on the trajectory that \u2013 on a trajectory that I'm very pleased with. As you say something in the mid-90s is quite attractive. And I also know that what our loss reserve posture has been in terms of how we go about picking loss ratio. So we think it's conservative. So as we look forward, we're quite enthused about where this portfolio is trending. Craig Howie : I would just add to that, Josh. I think we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth and the many new initiatives that we've launched over the last several years, which, if you recall, those were carefully chosen selected lines of business. As those continued to make up a larger and larger part of our portfolio as we continue to wind down, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, certain portfolios that we are exiting in a controlled way, which they're still obviously an earned premium lag in the P&L. As you see that transition continue to happen and gain momentum, in addition to what Don mentioned, taking a prudently cautious view of current accident years, we're pretty encouraged by where we are. Joshua Shanker : And you mentioned, Dom that you still have year-end reserve reviews to go. In the past couple of years the fourth quarter prior year reserve releases have been quite significant. At that time, have you also been rebasing the current accident year ever been in the past, 4Qs material changes to your in-year accident pick in that fourth quarter? Dominic Addesso : No, generally not. The only thing we look at that has to do with current year accident fix would be on the property side to the extent that we've had. We've either had, will be called non-cat cats. And if we've had some then we keep those reserves there in place. If we haven't had any non-cat cats like we did in the second quarter, and then we would adjust that current accident year for the very, very short tail lines for the non-cat cat piece. Is that what your \u2013 it\u2019s your question? Joshua Shanker : Yes, I think so. So well I guess just coming back to the first question, and coming into the fourth quarter, you still have year-end reserve reviews. But we shouldn't expect that's going to significantly impact your combined ratio in the insurance business through nine months or maybe a \u2013 maybe I m missing something there? Dominic Addesso : Well, any reserve redundancies or additions, obviously are going to affect the combined ratio on a year-to-date basis for the 12 months here. Craig, I think maybe understand\u2026 Craig Howie : Yes, I think I understand what you're asking. But prior year reserves reviews that would be completed would show up on the prior year line and would not be included in the attritional line for the year. Dominic Addesso : Okay, I\u2019m sorry. Joshua Shanker : Yes, so I guess the one thing in my view, I was expecting despite good results in insurance. I was expecting 2018 to be better than 2017. So far it's been, equivalent, which is fine. But I'm just trying to understand like maybe the fourth quarter might change that. I'm just trying to understand how the fourth quarter might, anything could change of course, but is there something that I'm not understanding about the fourth quarter, I guess? Dominic Addesso : And I think the way we're answering your question is more about how we're viewing the profitability of the book and of course we don't \u2013 as we've outlined in the past, we hold reserves for periods of years as it relates to the current accident year. So you don't see those improvements coming through that we believe are there. They take a couple years go merge. Joshua Shanker : Okay, the ultimate might be lower than the current pick. Dominic Addesso : You got it. Joshua Shanker : Yes. Okay, thank you. Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Josh. End of Q&A Dominic Addesso : Okay, sorry for going over. But we're glad to do it. Thanks again for your interest and your questions. We spoke this morning about the lots of things. I believe it's worth emphasizing that Everest is a franchise is not only as thrive over the Michael's \u2013 over the market cycle with above average total shareholder returns. But it's one, it's a franchise which is evolving and diversifying, based on where the future market opportunities are. And we've talked a lot about that this morning. Our goal remains the same, deliver above average returns on capital as we have done through time. Again, thank you for your interest this morning. I look forward to speaking with many of you over the weeks ahead. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Thank you, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Ltd. 2018 fourth quarter and year-end conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Jon. Good morning and thank you all for joining on the call this morning. As you know, Everest's fourth quarter was impacted by catastrophes in the amount of $695 million. This follows a third quarter with a series of events as well. It has been an unusual two-year period, estimated to be the highest on record at almost $240 billion of losses over those two years. With our global presence, balance sheet and business model, we undoubtedly expect our share of the losses. While the current estimates are consistent with prior market events, the difference from prior years is that despite the significant size of the catastrophes, Everest was still able to generate operating earnings over the two-year period of $603 million. This is the result of a focused effort to continue to diversify our portfolio by expanding our product set in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. We would expect that trend to continue as momentum is building rapidly in these initiatives. More on that later from my colleagues. Turning to our property cat business. Our portfolio over time has produced excess returns, extremely positive on average, but variable over any individual period. Many years are great and others require fortitude. However, as I have noted in the past, in the short term there may be some adjustments on our portfolio, particularly as we continue to allocate more capital to casualty and mortgage businesses. To be clear, the cat business remains a core part of our portfolio. However, pricing for risk in many circumstances has not firmed as much as required. On that business we take a pause and allocate our capital elsewhere. January did present some very good opportunities to get better risk-adjusted returns and some renewals were already adequately priced with expiring. Retro pricing, large programs and loss affected accounts, on balance, were strong. Nevertheless, our January 1 business for property cat reinsurance was down due to pricing on some business. Going forward, we would expect a stronger market as April and June renewals are dominated by loss affected areas, notably Japan and Florida. The market has some repair to do in these areas as industry issues, particularly in Florida around LAE and AOB are factors that have not been well considered in pricing. Couple that with what we see as desire for improved economics by third-party capital, and you have the recipe for positive renewal. We view the influence of alternative capital as somewhat neutral due to what appears to be at least some slowdown in the rate of growth there due to lockups from last year and perhaps a view on adequacy of pricing. Our conversation this morning should also focus on our strategic objective of building a diversified global reinsurer and insurer. To that point, you will note the strong performance of our insurance operation this year as highlighted by the fact that for the first time in many years, we produced an underwriting profit. This has truly been a journey as the legacy portfolio required some work. While at the same time, we were expanding into new classes and territories. We have set the table with an array of product offerings and many new distribution relationships and an international presence in London, Dublin and Toronto. This $2 billion-plus specialty insurer is completely overhauled and now truly represents our go-forward base. We are poised to accelerate from here and insurance will undoubtedly be a larger part of our future. Similarly, on the reinsurance front, we continue our diversification work. In terms of classes of business, mortgage and other credit-related premium continue to grow and are becoming a more relevant part of our underwriting profits. Also, as we have mentioned on previous calls, the casualty classes have seen improvement in rates, terms and conditions. As a result, our treaty casualty book is profitable and growing. This growth is mostly in proportional business, which does drive the overall combined ratio up, but nominal margins are increased with a higher premium base. Looking at geography, our new Zurich branch is enabling us to gain increased penetration in the Continental European market. On the investment front, while we still manage an overall conservative portfolio, we generated very positive returns, mainly due to our strategies around private equity. Rates are inching up. And while that bodes well going forward, it does have the medium term impact of negatively affecting marks on our existing portfolio. As a result, we have an unrealized loss this year which affects book value. But since the duration of our portfolio is relatively short, this will reverse as bonds mature. From a capital perspective, we did less than we planned in buybacks this past year due to cats. This was mostly due to being in blackout periods during the year as a result of uncertainty around cats and not because of any threat to our capital base, which is solid. As we go forward on our diversification efforts, there will likely be opportunity to consider additional buybacks as diversification could result in the ability to expand the premium to surplus ratio. This of course is all subject to the opportunities we see ahead as the market is developing. Before I turn it over to my colleagues where they will go into some detail on the operations, let me say that we have never been more confident about our ability to continue to perform at a high level. As I mentioned, volatility, although likely reduced in the near term given our portfolio expansion, remains a factor in our business. Nevertheless, Everest's ability to compound book value well above the industry over the long term remains our hallmark. Balance sheet strength remains intact, coupled with significant hedging structures in place and low financial leverage. Our diversification efforts at the Group level are taking hold. The insurance brand is growing profitably as a unique specialty insurer with global reach, achieving record gross written premium and positive underwriting income. After two challenging years, we find ourselves well-positioned in a changing macro environment. Cat pricing is likely to firm in certain areas given loss activity over the past two years, which could create enhanced opportunities. And insurance growth is in an improved rating environment presents some unique opportunities. The platforms we have in place are sound and my colleagues across the entire organization are outstanding. Our culture of underwriting and expense discipline, coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit, will enable us to continue to be a market leader. And I look forward to your questions later. And now over to Craig for the financial highlights. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a net loss of $382 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, a quarter heavily impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. This compares to net income of $571 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the year was $104 million compared to $469 million in 2017. The full year of 2018 was also impacted by catastrophe losses and realized capital losses. For the year, net income included $109 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $102 million of capital gains in 2017. The capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on our public equity portfolio. Since the end of the year, we've seen pre-tax realized capital gains of over $50 million. The after-tax operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $237 million compared to $535 million of operating income in 2017. Operating income excludes realized capital gains and losses, foreign exchange and the tax impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the year, operating income was $191 million compared to $413 million in 2017. The primary difference was higher catastrophe losses booked in 2018. In the fourth quarter, Everest saw $875 million of net pre-tax catastrophe losses compared to $36 million in fourth quarter of 2017. The breakdown of the pre-tax loss estimates by event is as follows : Hurricane Michael was $400 million; the Camp Fire in California was $300 million; the Woolsey Fire in California was $150 million; and the Australia hailstorm was $25 million, for a total of $875 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. These losses were pre-tax figures net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. As a reminder, the Company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss exposure budget for the year. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87% for the year compared to 85% last year. This increase is due to a change in business mix, with the growth in our pro rata premium during 2018 which carries a higher combined ratio. Our year-to-date Group expense ratio remains well at 5.4%, while our commission ratio of 21.9% remains stable. On reserves. We completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. The results of the studies indicated that overall reserves were redundant and in the fourth quarter we booked $74 million of favorable prior-year reserve development. This included favorable prior-year prior-period development for both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segments and is in addition to the $100 million of favorable prior year development reported in the second and third quarters of 2018. The insurance segment reported $51 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter and $52 million for the year, which was largely related to its workers compensation business. The reinsurance segments reported $23 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $122 million for the year, which related to the casualty and property business, both in the United States and Bermuda. These redundancies have developed over time but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We continue to hold our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $140 million for the quarter and $581 million for the year on our $18 billion investment portfolio. Year-to-date investment income was up $38 million or 7% from one year ago. The result was primarily driven by higher yields on the fixed income portfolio and the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $10 million over 2017. During the fourth quarter, we made a tactical shift to de-risk the investment portfolio. We reduced our public equity and alternative investment portfolios by over $500 million and reinvested in investment-grade fixed income. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.2% compared to 3.1% one year ago as both investment-grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year. The rising new money yields will boost future net investment income. On income taxes. The tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events were written in the United States, the tax benefit primarily reflects the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be about 13%, which reflects an annual cat load of less than 7 points. Shareholders' equity for the Group was $7.9 billion at the end of 2018 compared to $8.4 billion at the end of 2017. The decline in shareholders' equity during 2018 is primarily attributable to the $256 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income investment portfolio, $77 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and capital returned through $260 million of dividends paid as well as $75 million of share buybacks, partially offset by $104 million of net income. Since year-end, the mark-to-market gain on the fixed income portfolio is approximately $100 million pre-tax. Our capital position remains strong. The catastrophe losses of 2017 and 2018 were contained within earnings and therefore had no impact on our capital position. During the year - during the quarter, the Company announced an 8% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Following the unprecedented back-to-back years of significant catastrophe losses, Everest remains as a solid and stable partner for our clients with the financial strength, experienced underwriters and a full suite of products required in this rapidly changing market. Although our 2018 earnings were impacted by these catastrophe losses, our capital position remains strong and our willingness to deploy meaningful capacity at favorable risk-adjusted pricing remains intact. Our resilience is the result of our ongoing strategy to build an extremely diversified reinsurance portfolio by class of business, product type and geography. Although 01/01 pricing did not reflect a traditional across-the-board hard market, Everest still had a successful renewal. We were able to allocate our capacity to the best opportunities by proactively utilizing our core skill and our market differentiators. These include : a strong balance sheet and ratings, with meaningful capacity and $13 billion of underwriting capital, including our third-party capital; a full suite of products across all P&C lines of business in most geographies; trust from reinsurance buyers and brokers in the strength, stability and longevity of Everest; we have been trading with many of our customers and brokers around the globe for over 40 years; experienced underwriters in local markets with deep product expertise; and a dynamic culture with a flat, nimble organization that can pivot swiftly to the best opportunities. Through these strengths, we empower our local teams to execute, unencumbered by internal and external distractions such as M&A, weakening relevance and restructurings that several of our competitors face. Accordingly, during this renewal season we focused on the best underwriting opportunities in support of our core clients. Everest maintained and increased shares on our clients' most strategic programs and layers that also demonstrated the best prices for the exposures. This focused underwriting meant moving away from some property layers or programs while increasing some casualty or other long tail lines which has further diversified our portfolio. Now some detail on the reinsurance division's financial results for the full year of 2018. The reinsurance business experienced strong growth in gross written premiums of 22%, with all three segments contributing strongly to $6.2 billion in gross written premium in 2018. Much of the growth across the reinsurance division came from non-property lines, including casualty, motor, mortgage, surety and aviation. While underwriting profit per dollar of pro rata premium is lower than excessive loss, volatility is also considerably lower, consuming less capital per premium dollar. As a result, Everest had $360 million of underwriting profit in 2018 from nonproperty lines of reinsurance, which is up over $50 million versus 2017. For the full year of 2018, the reinsurance operations reported a 113% combined ratio, with 33 points of net cat losses incurred. The attritional combined ratio is up about 3 points to 84% from 2017, given the larger amount of pro rata premium and more casualty premiums earned during 2018. The U.S. reinsurance segment 2018 gross written premiums grew by 16% to $3 billion. The largest contributions were from pro rata casualty, mortgage and pro rata property. With 135% combined ratio, this segment bore the brunt of the catastrophe losses, most notably California wildfires, Hurricanes Michael and Florence and the development on Hurricane Irma. Total catastrophe losses reported to this segment were 58 loss ratio points for the year. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 83%, up about 5 points from 2017 due to more pro rata earned premium. In the Bermuda segment, 2018 gross written premium grew to $1.7 billion, an increase of 38%. This segment had its strongest growth from casualty pro rata, Lloyd's fee-bearing deal and mortgage. In addition, motor, aviation, political risk and trade credit written out of our London and Zurich operations also contributed to the growth in the Bermuda segment. This segment had an 88.5% combined ratio, aided by 2 points of reduction in prior year attritional losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 88 points, representing a 1.5-point decrease from 2017, despite the larger mix of proportional business. In the international segment, we grew gross written premium 17% to $1.5 billion in 2018. Growth was broad-based, including pro rata property and casualty in many territories including Canada, Latin America, Asia and Middle East and Africa as well as robust growth in international fac. The combined ratio was 96.9%, which included 18 points of catastrophe losses. The 2018 attritional combined ratio was 81.1%, with about a 2.6-point increase in the attritional loss ratio from 2017. The amount of pro rata premium affected this metric also. In 2018, most of our roughly 15 major reinsurance profit centers made an underwriting profit, with the exception of those few which were heavily impacted by large risk losses and the catastrophes in the USA and in Japan. Now I will give some color on the January 1 renewal. We headed into the 01/01 renewals with the strategy to push rate, terms and conditions on property where needed, to deploy more risk capital into other classes with improving economics, notably casualty, mortgage and credit. We also planned to increase support of our global clients and strategic reinsurance partners, areas which continue to develop strongly with meaningful profit opportunities. Broadly, we were successful with this plan. Now more details about 01/01. Regarding property reinsurance, the overall market at 01/01 was mixed. Loss affected business and retrocessional accounts showed rate increases, while much of the remaining market was relevantly flat. In areas unaffected by losses and on small capacity layers that are easier to fill out the required capacity, these were much more closer to flat or even down which was disappointing given recent industry losses. Everest held the line on changes to terms and conditions and reduced our share where economics fell below our expectation of acceptable pricing levels. We reserved our cat capacity for our best clients and the best price opportunities, while leaving some dry powder to deploy for property business throughout 2019. Altogether, both our 01/01 property premium and exposures have reduced as we pushed rate, terms and conditions and withheld capacity where we found it prudent. In terms of pricing at 01/01, as we have demonstrated in multiple prior renewal cycles, we were able to achieve significantly improved risk-adjusted rates, beyond what was reflected by the average market rate changes mentioned in the headline. This is driven by our leading global franchise and ability to deploy meaningful capacity in all P&C lines for clients around the world. The end result was an overall improvement in expected ROE across our global property cat book, but with a wide dispersion of results. Our growth in - reinsurance more than made up our decrease in property writings. Our expanded long tail writings have included new deals as well as increased shares on accounts with improving pricing on the original insurance rates, increased reinsurance rates or improved ceding commissions. Furthermore, we continue to expand our product set and capabilities. We have recently added to our in-force business in lines such as multipara crop in North America and in Asia; mortgage, structured products, aviation, political risk and trade credit and several new product offerings in Canada; and we continue to see improving pricing in broader opportunities in facultative business in the U.S. and internationally, given dislocation in several major markets. In summary, the market at this 01/01 renewal is mixed, particularly given the loss activity over the last two years. But overall, we were pleased with our ability to execute our game plan. We pushed rate, terms and conditions on property reinsurance; deployed more risk capital in both a relative and absolute basis in casualty and mortgage; and we expanded relationships with global clients who continue to want to buy more reinsurance across all property and casualty lines from large, well-rated global reinsurers such as Everest. Our success with the global clients was particularly noteworthy in our London and Zurich operations at January 1st. Given a relative shift to more casualty and more pro rata, we have seen upward pressure on the attritional loss ratio. But the dollars of underwriting margin remain robust and we like the trade. We expect our Q1 2019 business, which is broader than just 01/01, to be up on gross written premium compared to Q1 2018, given our strong success and continued opportunities in the segments I just mentioned. We also expect gross written premium booked throughout 2019 and beyond. This is from large proportional deals where we recognize premium throughout the year slower than some of our competitors as well as from multiyear deals such as mortgage. So we effectively have written but not reported premium coming from these classes. On the alternative capital side, investors continue to support Mt. Logan as we onboarded some new investors at 01/01/19, resulting in assets under management being slightly up compared to a year ago. Investors in Mt. Logan benefit from Everest's world-class property underwriting expertise and access to broadly diversified business from around the globe. And Everest investors continue to get the benefit of protections from Logan in above-average cat years such as 2017 and 2018. Given the improvement in our reinsurance portfolio, supported by our organizational resilience, underwriting acumen, relevance and diversified capital structure, we remain bullish on our future and we look forward to our success in 2019 and beyond. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thanks, John, and good morning. 2018 was a pivotal year in the history of Everest Insurance highlighted by several noteworthy achievements. First and foremost, we're pleased to report a full year of GAAP underwriting profit with a combined ratio of 95.3%. This is the first underwriting profit Everest Insurance has delivered since 2006 and continues our recent trend which has produced an underwriting profit in seven of the last eight quarters. Our $77 million of underwriting income reflects a $146 million swing from the prior year and it's the third-largest underwriting income we have achieved in 20 years. This result speaks to the successful implementation of our strategy, the growing resiliency of our platform and the immense efforts of the talented team we have steadfastly and carefully assembled over the past four years. Highlighting the year. Our gross written premium achieved a record $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 9% over 2017. Our growth, while more moderate than the prior three years, reflects both the balanced contributions from our many underwriting divisions and targeted product lines and the impact of continued reunderwriting of some legacy portfolios. Over the past several years, largely beginning in 2016, we have written $1.4 billion of new gross written premium in high-value, carefully selected lines of business that simply were not part of the product portfolio prior to this time. Further, over 15% of that three-year premium number or approximately $230 million has originated from outside the U.S. market via our growing international operations and select global product lines. At the same time, we have nonrenewed, divested or reunderwritten portfolios approximating $500 million in gross written premium that simply do not fit with our future strategy. As a result, we conclude 2018 with the following : solid underwriting profit and risk-adjusted returns; record levels of gross written premium despite offsets from nonrenewed business; the deepest roster of actively underwritten specialty products in our history; the broadest geographic reach, 17 offices across the U.S., Canada, London and Europe for us to execute our business from; and the highest number of engaged insurance colleagues across disciplines around the world for making all this happen. We remain encouraged about our progress to date and look forward to enhancing the value of our platform on behalf of all of our constituents into 2019. Before moving on to the financials, I want to briefly comment on the transformation process we have been executing on over the past several years. As we have discussed on past calls, we have been planning, communicating and executing on a multifaceted strategic plan. This has been an extremely ambitious and challenging effort, but thanks to the incredible work and contributions from our colleagues, we're now poised for continued profitable growth in the future. The results I just referenced reflect the remarkable turnaround in a relatively short amount of time. We have grown organically and with discipline, one product at a time, one employee at a time, one office location at a time. And we have grown despite the actions accompanying our significant portfolio repositioning. With each new product, new employee, new capability and new location, we have become stronger and more resilient and I believe better as a specialty diversified insurance company. As a result, Everest Insurance is at an exacting inflection point. With the majority of the transformation work behind us, we recognize there is much more work ahead to achieve our ultimate vision. We are encouraged by the fact that we've built a strong, diversified well-established company within the specialty insurance market. We now have the full arsenal of tools we sought to attain, people, platforms, products and services, and we will continue building on the foundation we have established to further enhance our competitive position, profitability and growth. Turning to the financial results. I'll speak mainly to the full year results. I want to start with a comment on the quarter. The fourth quarter registered an outstanding 87.3% combined ratio despite nearly 4 points of pre-tax cat losses attributable predominantly to Hurricane Michael. We benefited from 12 points of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter, the second year in a row we have experienced favorable prior year development as a result of our annual reserve review. In summary, it was an excellent quarter. Year-to-date, we achieved $2.3 billion in gross written premium, representing growth of $191 million or 9% over 2017. On a constant dollar basis, this growth improves to 10%, recognizing the growing contribution of our international operations. Normalizing for the impact of lines the business where deliberate underwriting actions were taken, the growth rate for the full year more than doubles to 21%. A solid percentage of this growth is emanating from the new businesses and products accepted over the past four years, inclusive of our increasingly relevant Lloyd's operation which equips $150 million in gross written premium in 2018, a 30% increase over 2017. Each of these products and markets chosen for particular risk return characteristics, is playing an increasingly important role in our diversified portfolio. Our net premiums were $1.7 billion for 2018, an increase of 5% over the prior year period. Net earned premium of $1.6 billion increased by solid $177 million or 12% over 2017. For the full year, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.3%. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, our reported combined ratio improved to 93.3%. The global insurance operations experienced roughly $33 million of net pre-tax cat losses, a significant improvement over the prior year period. Net favorable prior-year development had a beneficial impact of 3.2 points, reflecting the continued strength of our reserve portfolio. Again, this is the first full year GAAP profit in the last 12 years. The year-to-date reported loss ratio was 65%, which is a 10-point improvement to 2017's reported loss ratio of 75%. The majority of this difference is attributable to lower cat losses due to various underwriting actions and effective portfolio hedging. The loss ratio, excluding cats, also slightly improved by 14 basis points to 63% despite 70 basis points less of favorable prior year development. Our combined ratio and underlying results continue to improve as a result of the many underwriting initiatives instituted in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. The 2018 attritional loss and loss expense ratio also improved by 80 basis points to 66.2% from 67% in 2017. While this is less improvement than we had anticipated, there were several mix changes and prolonged runoff activity that moderated additional improvement. Nonetheless, the trajectory is undeniable and, again, we anticipate continued improvement in 2019. Turning to expenses. For the full year 2018, the expense ratio was 30.3%, essentially in line with the 29.8% for 2017. We have maintained this steady, and I'll add, competitive, expense ratio even as we have continued to invest in people, infrastructure and technology. With the overall Everest operating discipline in mind, I certainly have my eye in the expense ratio and we will continue to balance future investments with our expectations of profitable premium growth. At the same time, we see continued investment in the organization as necessary to maintain an expense advantage and we'll continue to thoughtfully invest in the years ahead. We are particularly excited about several investments we have made in new and emerging technologies that are enhancing underwriting insights, creating meaningful operating efficiencies and improving our speed to market, thus enhancing our client value proposition. Turning to the operating environment. Overall, rate trends over the first three quarters - and these are pure rate, I'm referring to, gained some momentum in the fourth quarter, particularly in the commercial auto, GL and property lines, both in the North America and the London and European markets. Excluding our workers' compensation and accident and health portfolios, overall pure rate change for the North American P&C insurance operations where the majority of our renewable book resides, was plus 4.6% for 2018. This was up 3.6 points over 2017 and continues a two-year trend where we have experienced positive aggregate rate in the non-worker's compensation lines of business. Our workers' compensation portfolio continues to experience high single digit rate pressure yet also continues to deliver solid return. Despite the work comp pricing environment, the improvement in overall price trend is evidence of our growing diversification and resiliency across the portfolio. These outcomes were largely anticipated and factored into our pricing and reserving decisions for the year. To offer some additional color on the overall rate movements across our portfolio, our commercial auto segment continued to receive corrective rate action, a trend that has now persisted for several years. Overall, we achieved positive rate across this book in 2018, delivering low double digit increases. As for the primary general liability markets, we also achieved slightly positive rate in the fourth quarter of plus 1.3%, while excess casualty picked up some momentum with roughly 2.2% increases, reflecting our predominantly excess oriented book of business. Internationally, our rate levels also showed signs of improvement, with our Lloyd's operation delivering a positive 3% change across the portfolio. We expect this to continue and to increase in the months ahead. While financial and professional lines rates appeared to be turning the corner and actually improved in the second half of the year, it was not enough to deliver a full year increase. As for our property book, we achieved healthy and needed rate increases of just over 10%, and we believe this will continue as well. We do anticipate moderately improving operating conditions across our global portfolio throughout 2019, with some pockets lagging this broader trend as they are in need of further corrective rate action. Further, as our retention ratios steadily improve, we anticipate the stronger rate environment to have an increasingly beneficial impact to our results. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our results in 2018. We are gratified by the progress we have made and feel energized by the results of our strategic plan. We are well-positioned with our chosen markets and we are improving our organization each and every day. We expect our relevance among our valued clients to continue to grow as we become an increasingly important trading partner to them. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future calls. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrea for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan : First to Dom. You have made a lot of changes over the last five years to make Everest Re a more diversified franchise. I wish you the best on your upcoming retirement. So as the Board is searching for your successor, can you give us updates on what kind of characteristics that you're looking in a candidate and - either internally or externally? At the same time, will the Board consider - also consider strategic alternatives? Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Kai, for your well wishes. And the Board, as you know, is in the process of looking for a successor in my role. And I think the things that the Board and I will be looking for will be obviously strong leadership characteristics, knowledge of our business. So it's not - can't preclude anything. But it's more than likely it would be somebody that has experience in the space and some tenure in the space. And more than that, I really cannot talk at this time. I think the process as I mentioned is under way, and it would be the classic qualities that you look for in any CEO. Kai Pan : Will the Board consider - open to strategic alternatives? Dominic Addesso : We are not - that is not an option that's part of this process. Obviously, that's something that any Board - you have to consider if presented with strategic alternatives. But that is not part of this process. Kai Pan : And then back to the reinsurance business, the core margin or the attritional combined ratio deteriorated more than 900 basis points year-over-year. I just wonder outside the business mix, any other factor driven that to the 88.7% attritional combined ratio in the fourth quarter? Is it a good run rate going forward? Or we should be looking probably at 84% for the full year? Dominic Addesso : I will ask Craig to comment on the - on part of this. But let me just begin it by saying that the mix shift is approximately a 2 point impact. And I'll ask Craig to speak to the third point of it. Craig Howie : Yes. The other point for the year, Kai, is in the fourth quarter we did see about $50 million of reinsurance attritional losses coming through in the fourth quarter. And what that means is what we would call our non-cat cat losses, in other words, weather or events that were less our $10 million catastrophe threshold. So we did see weather losses, we saw shipyard fires, refinery explosions and other fires, and they occurred around the world, so Canada, the U.K., Australia, Latin America and the U.S. So that, in itself, is about 3 points in the quarter - in the fourth quarter and about 1 point for the year. Dominic Addesso : And these would be besides events because these would - as you - I think you heard from other market participants, that there has been some frequency of severity if you will in some of these large risk losses. So we think this is - this has been an unusual year and we're not anticipating that going forward. Clearly, we do have an attritional pick for these lines of business but 2018 was particularly a heavy year for some risk losses. Kai Pan : Just follow-up on that. As you grow your like nonproperty business faster than your property business, which carry higher attritional combined ratio, which means that your - into 2019, will that attritional combined ratio continue to drift higher? Dominic Addesso : No. I think what we're saying is that what you saw in terms of the drift, about 2 points, is kind of where we think it will settle out there. It could drift a little bit from there. But I think the important point is not so much to focus on the combined ratio but focus on the underwriting margin. As John Doucette pointed out, we actually increased our underwriting margin by $50 million from $300 million - just over $300 million to $360 million in this last year and so therefore the combined ratio tick-up is offset by still that underwriting - that margin in the combined ratio applying to a higher premium base. So I think that for us - that's what should be - what you should focus on. Operator : We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : You might just read my numbers but I think I'm close. I look at your share of the 4Q '18 events at about 3.7% of the industry's loss. And I look at your experience in 3Q of this year and then the second half of last year at being about 1.5% of the industry's loss. Am I reading that correctly, that your exposure on average was twice what it typically has been? And if there's some difference as you switch to a pro rata book? Or is this an exceptional set of circumstances particularly in 4Q where you had outsized exposure? Dominic Addesso : All right. Let me, without having done any due diligence on your numbers, let me just give you what our view of market share is. Generally, given our scale in the marketplace, on any one event what we've experienced over the last 10 or 15 years has been - and again, on any one event - somewhere between - and it depends on where - somewhere between 2% and 4% of any particular event. And then generally for a particular year plus a series of events, our market share has been 1.3%, 1.2%, somewhere in that range. And if you look at the results for the '17 events and the '18 events, we are settling in at about 1.3% market share, which is pretty consistent with - if you go a little way back to 2010 and '11 which is - were the two successive years of pretty heavy cat losses, it's very consistent with that. But again, what you're looking at in the fourth quarter I think is in part reflective of where we placed our cat bets. So for example, Hurricane Michael, we generally are, as you know, a larger writer of Florida cat. And in particular, we have made underwriting decisions that we, in particular, like the exposure in the Panhandle as opposed to - contrast it with Miami and Dade County, for example. And so we have long-standing relationships with many clients who themselves have made bigger bets in that region of Florida. So as a consequence where that loss happened to hit tended be an area where we have a little bit more concentration. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question, but couldn't place what you're asking. Josh Shanker : I think it does to some extent. So if I take that a little further ,one of your competitors last week said they took a rather large lumpy loss in the wildfires. And they said that if we could do it all over again we would still make the same bet again because we think we got paid adequately to take that loss. If I go back in time a year ago, I think you told me and the investment community that the ROE, all things being equal, in the 2018 book was better than the 2017 book. Do you still feel that way? And do you feel that although it didn't work out in '18 you liked the construction of '18 book? Or are there postmortems that you would do differently? Dominic Addesso : Well, first of all ,there's always postmortems. There's always things you learn from every cat event, OK? But it still holds up that across the entire portfolio, the returns that we had priced in for '18 relative to '17 and frankly for '19 relative to '18 have improved. Now, I guess the real question is - or maybe underlying your question is, whether or not the way we modeled that exposure, the risk, is that's the way it kind of played out. And I would say, generally for Florida, yes. It just so happened as I mentioned with Hurricane Michael that where that particular storm hit affected us in that way. I do think though that there's probably for the industry things to learn from wildfire exposure. Notwithstanding the fact that back-to-back wildfire events of those magnitudes have essentially never been seen in the marketplace. So it's not as if history was telling us that it could happen. But I do think in reflection, it's probably fair to say that the models have not adequately addressed the wildfire exposure. And so therefore I do think that going forward and certainly we have into our '19 portfolio have addressed that in either pricing or scaling back or terms and conditions to more tightly control the wildfires because I think that's the risk that wasn't quite as well understood as certainly wind. Does that answer your question? Operator : We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : First, as we look at the large non-cat losses, does some of that have to do with the business mix shift into more attritional? Or was that really what you would consider one-offs that would not really be expected to recur? John Doucette : Good morning. It's John. So I don't think it really has to do with shift. It really has in some ways to do with our definition of catastrophes. So a lot of, in places around the globe, we may have a lot of these - a lot of these deals. We may only get through a certain - a few clients or a certain territory. And so a lot of times, as Craig said that $50 million may result in where we have $3 million, $5 million, $8 million of losses tied to these things that the industry would think of as catastrophes. How we classify them? We don't call them catastrophes and that's from kind of a process point of view that we want - in terms of we want to have a materiality threshold for what we track as catastrophe. So I don't think it has to do with the shift in the mix. A lot of the shift in the mix we're talking about is moving to non-property which frankly wouldn't be exposed to these types of losses. And we also saw in addition to what we call the non-cat caps for us below $10 million, there were also some large risk losses in the industry that also people in the industry - other people in the industry may consider them catastrophes. We don't - a single risk loss, we don't consider a catastrophe in how we articulate the cat losses and the attritional losses. Yaron Kinar : But I thought that the shift to quota share was on just on the casualty side also, on property itself. And if you do shift to pro rata, wouldn't that necessarily mean that you would be exposed to lower layers? John Doucette : Yes. Absolutely, that should be the case. A lot of the shift that we're talking about is not necessarily taking place in the international space a lot. And one of the things - for the points that you raised, one of the things when we talk about property pro rata premium and increasing that particularly in the U.S. and the places over the last 2017 and '18 where the losses were hit, a lot of our clients - a couple of things. A lot of our clients are looking for capital relief and quota shares, provide them more meaningful capital relief than cap does in terms of de-levering their premium base. And so that's helpful for them. But we also spend a lot of time as we decide we want to deploy capacity as on a cat basis, property catastrophe excess a loss or in a quota share basis, we'll look at the occurrence limits that are within the proportional treaties that we have. And we watch the occurrence limits very, very carefully and really try to support our current property quota share deals that have very tight occurrence limits so that it becomes less of - less exposed to the issue that you're raising. Yaron Kinar : And then two quick clarifications, if I can. Dom, you said that the business mix shift account for about 2 points of the combined ratio deterioration in '18. Was that for the full year or for the quarter? Dominic Addesso : It's a full year comment. Yaron Kinar : Full year? Okay. And the other clarification was on the 7% cat load target for '19. Is that on a net of reinstatement reinsurance basis with pre-tax? Craig Howie : Yes. That is net and it's pre-tax and that - correct, not net of reinstatement - net of reinsurance. Yaron Kinar : Net of reinsurance, not of reinstatements, and pre-tax. Okay. Thank you very much. Dominic Addesso : And less than 7 points. Operator : We will now take our next question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Maybe just a quick follow-up to Yaron's question. Going back to the 7 points number, I was looking at the older transcripts and I was trying to recall, what was the cat load you were using for 2018 and 2017? Craig Howie : So for 2018, that number was just below 9 points. And for 2017, that number would have been about 10 points, Amit. Amit Kumar : So that was what was built in your expectations, not the actual, correct? Dominic Addesso : Correct. That's correct. Amit Kumar : The other question I have is in the opening remarks you talked about the reserve study. And I was looking at, I think it's page -- sorry, Page 6 of the supplement, and under the U.S. Reinsurance, the reserve release number is down materially versus the past. Are there any pluses and minuses in that $1.5 million release number? This is Page 6 of 13 in the supplement. Dominic Addesso : Amit, there's - and I'll ask Craig to see if he has any additional comments, but... Amit Kumar : Yes. Dominic Addesso : As I think probably you realize we've mentioned before, there are some 200 different reserve categories or buckets as we call them and there are ups and downs in reserves all the time. I think no meaningful downs that I can cite, and Craig is hoping to add to that. But I will say that I don't know if we're looking at the quarter or the year-to-date, but keep in mind that we did have some reserve adjustments earlier in the year. So if you look at the complete year, if you look at the positive reserve margins that have come through, and I will also add that there's always going to be variation in the amount of redundancies that perhaps come through - hopefully come through. But I will point out that this would be the seventh year now of positive reserve development across the entire Group. And I think in any one particular year, it could be up, it could be down. But to me what's most relevant and important is that seven years of positive development. I think that's something we're all very mindful of and frankly proud of. So anyway, Craig, is there anything to add to that? Craig Howie : Well, what I would add is - just to reiterate what Dom said is that we would look at the total year as opposed to just the fourth quarter. And as Dom said, we strive to carry an adequate reserve position in each one of these reserve segments. And the Company does react quickly to adverse development and takes its time to react to that favorable development and we do continue to hold in more recent years in each one of these segments. Amit Kumar : So net-net, there wasn't any adverse development which offset the reserve releases, the $1.5 million. Dominic Addesso : Nothing major that - that would make you say that now. Amit Kumar : Perfect. That's what was I was looking for. The last question and I will requeue is, I wanted to go back to Josh Shanker's question and I think that is a philosophical question a lot of us have been asking based on the last two years. Did I understand it correctly in your response where I think what you were saying is we've had two years of back-to-back materially higher losses and hence it's less of an Everest Re risk selection issue, it's probably more attributable to how the models responded? And now that you're putting corrective actions into place that takes care of it, is that how - is that what the takeaway should be that had the models responded differently, it would have been... Dominic Addesso : No, I wasn't. If I - if you thought I said that, I apologize. I think what I was saying is let's think about these two separate buckets. Let's think about the windstorm, in particular Michael. The models in that particular case are reasonable and fairly reliable. In our particular case, because of where we've chosen to put our capacity tends to be more in places like the Panhandle as contrasted with higher exposure in Miami and Dade. So I don't necessarily believe that that quote unquote required any corrective action. To the extent that I was thinking or you might have heard me think about corrective action, I think it had more to do with the wildfire exposure and the fact that the models are less reliable as it relates to wildfire notwithstanding the fact that this most recent two years of wildfire losses is something we haven't really experienced ever. But I would still contend that the models aren't as reliable. Therefore, corrective actions that we have taken relative to wildfire is cutting back some rates, terms conditions, sub limit, et cetera. That's the area I thought I was really trying to suggest that quote unquote any corrective actions required. John Doucette : And, Amit, this is John. I just want to add a little more color to what Dom said. So Dom and I have been here about 10 years. And during that time, we've seen all - different catastrophe losses, and go down the list, the Japanese earthquake, the Thai floods, et cetera, et cetera - Sandy. In every loss, we learn, we evolve, the industry learns, the industry evolves, we make our models better, we make our underwriting better. I think part of what Dom was alluding to is, also when you think about like the wildfires. The wildfires have been kind of a secondary risk characteristic for the industry. And we think given the unprecedented losses that have happened over the last two years, that it's going to move not just in the model but also in the buyers, the rating agencies, the board of directors of the clients. They're going to think about this in a different way. We're already hearing some of our clients are looking to increase their limits that they buy. We think that in the future we may see wildfire exposure split out as a different reinsurance program for some people. But it's all that is how these - or how these evolve in how the industry thinks of the risk. Clearly, there's an elevated view on buyers, sellers, again board of directors, rating agencies, et cetera, about the wildfire risk. And it's not just in California. We also had the Fort McMurray situation in Canada a few years back. And I think all of this is going to help move this to be more like hurricane and earthquake as a primary loss that people have - a primary loss component that has to be factored in more explicitly, and frankly that the industry has to do a better job in terms of how it thinks about it, how it underwrites it, and terms and conditions in the contracts for that. And that's part of the natural evolution and we think that's frankly healthy for everybody. Dominic Addesso : So let me add to that too since John brought up a 10-year window just by way of example. I think it's worth a reminder that we manage - particularly because part of our portfolio was cat business, subject to volatility, we manage for the long-term which you have to do when you're thinking about cat exposure which can be nil in any one year, and as we've seen in the past two years, it can be record-setting. But if you think about the past 10 years where we have clearly cat as a portion of our portfolio and we think about total value creation over the past 10 years, it's been around 11%. We happened to think that's - and by the way that's before pretty hefty years in terms of cat losses. So you had '10 and '11 and of course the last two which were record-setting. So that 10-year track record I think speaks to how we price our portfolio, how we think about risk, but again managing for the long term. Another little factoid if you will is over the last 10 years, our profits from our cat business on a net basis have been almost $3 billion. Amit Kumar : That's fascinating. Might I - I know I've exceeded my time. Just only one quick clarification what you just said. What industry loss are you assuming for that 7 points guidance? Thanks. Dominic Addesso : I'm not sure that you can equate it to an industry loss. I mean, that's an average estimated annual loss. John Doucette : That's right. So it would be - we don't think of the world like that. We would look at what our gross in that exposures are and look at what we think what the cat loads that are tied to that and then compare it to our overall premium. So it's really a function of, again, what we're trying to get at as the diversification of the book and how we continue and frankly doing a tremendous job on the insurance side of growing and building the franchise and we see a lot of runway there to continue to do that. And all that will help and has helped us move the overall - the cat load as a percentage and bringing it down. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : Just a couple of quick ones here. First one, I'm just curious what was the impact of Mt. Logan's minority interest stuff in the quarter just to the other income line? Craig Howie : Roughly a $5 million loss, Brian. Brian Meredith : $5 million? Right. And then what does Mt. Logan's capacity look like for this year? Is it down? Up? What's going to happen with Mt. Logan as we look at 2019? John Doucette : So, as I - this is John, Brian. So I said in my script, it's up - slightly up year-over-year. So we - it's down slightly from Q3, but then some of the - because of losses, but then some existing investors have added capacity and we have some new investors and continue to diversify the investor base. And so we would expect that to continue go up over time. But again, that's something that we look at in terms of as kind of our core strategic securitization vehicle. It's something we look at to make sure how it fits in executing our plan, our overall plan. So we'll factor, do we want to take more money or not. All things being equal, we would expect it's up now slightly compared to a year ago. And we would think that it would continue to go up to potentially increase somewhat but it will be market condition dependent. Craig Howie : Overall, still assets under management, about $1 billion. John Doucette : It's about $1 billion - about $1.1 billion. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Meyer Shields : I'm just trying to clarify. So I apologize for the repetition. But the cat load for 2019, the expected cat load is down 2 points. Should we assume that there is on a year-over-year basis still some upward drift in the combined ratio? Or was that all contained in the full year for 2018? Dominic Addesso : Well, again, relative '19 versus '18? Meyer Shields : Yes, '19 versus '18. The cat load is down and you've explained why I think very thoroughly. But I'm just trying to figure out how to model sort of core ex-cat ex-reserve development margins on a year-over-year basis. Dominic Addesso : So I think what we said before was that we were expecting our attritional given the current mix, the attritional - again, it depends in part to how much premium you put into your model. But, given the same mix, then the 2-point shift as we've seen in '18 over '17 is approximately correct. Meyer Shields : Okay. So... Dominic Addesso : Is that what you were asking? Meyer Shields : I meant to ask you whether there should be another 2 points in 2019 on an expected basis? Dominic Addesso : No. We're not saying that at all. Meyer Shields : Second question, and maybe a little bit related, but - I'm trying to understand the timing of a de-risk investment portfolio when you're moving to longer tail lines of business that could probably absorb more short-term volatility. Craig Howie : Meyer, this is Craig. I think what ended up happening too is partially the de-risking of the portfolio was to take some - overall, just to take some of the public equity portfolio down at the end of the year, just taking some of the risk off the table. Some of the alternatives that we did was because we shifted capital around in the organization for where the capital was needed and where we're writing the business, to match those two components, and because of that we had the opportunity to de-risk some of the portfolio. As we go forward, we certainly will determine and look at both the duration and the types of business that we have as far as what our portfolio mix will be going forward. Operator : We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : I have a few questions. My first question, if we go back to some of your comments on the market, you guys like others seem to be a bit more bullish on the midyear renewals. But I think back, cat rates have really disappointed relative to expectations going back to 2006 really, and you guys already said that Logan is seeing more capital this year than last year. So what gives you confidence that the midyear renewals won't disappoint? John Doucette : Good morning, Elyse. This is John. So we don't have a crystal ball. All we would say is that when it comes midyear, a lot of midyear is really Florida at June 1, and then different places, U.S., China, Australia, Latin America, at July 1. So a lot of it's going to be loss dependent. A lot of it - I mean, Florida market has seen some pretty active years the last several years and there was a lot of increase in development that the clients, the Florida clients had when it came to particularly Irma. So I think really we don't know what's going to happen, but I do think that what we saw at 01/01 and we just touched on it briefly is a lot of the alternative capital we think took a pause. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of concern about some of the losses. There's also some investor fatigue when it comes to some of the losses that we're hearing about in the alternative capital. We would note that - we would note that - sorry, we would note that Logan has had some of the best returns in the industry. So we think that helps our ability and I think the Logan investors buy into access to the - to Everest's global portfolio and underwriting expertise and that helps. But we also had redemptions in Mt. Logan as well. And we think that overall, there have been redemptions in the alternative capital. So I think a lot of alternative capital has looked and said that they need to understand the risks that they're taking better. And frankly, we're hearing people that are requiring a higher return. That's just healthier. We think that the entire market, the reinsurance, traditional, and alternative market is evolving with some of the hiccups that have happened recently. And we think that just puts the entire market in a better place for getting an appropriate return. What that means and how the rates, we're not sure. Elyse Greenspan : And then in terms of going back to your cat load of the less than 7 points, is that due to, I guess, lower writing, lower earned premium? I just kind of want to get a sense of if I could look back over the past 10 years, your cat load sits about 12 points. Obviously, that includes some larger loss years, but what's really driving the expected annual loss down in 2019? Dominic Addesso : The biggest driver of that going down would be our diversification. So growing in the non-cat areas, growing our insurance operation, growing our cash re book, growing our mortgage book, and some slight downward drift in our property exposure. So - but a big piece of that is diversification and we're getting larger. We're getting larger and not increasing cat - in fact, slightly decreasing it. So those two factors together. Elyse Greenspan : And then your tax rate, you said, I believe, 13%, which seems about higher. I thought in the past we were talking about kind of high single digits if you were in line with your cat load. Is part of that due to a lower level of cat losses expected over this coming year? Or is there something else I'm missing that's driving up your expected tax rate? Craig Howie : Part of that is lower cats expected, but it's also more capital allocated to the United States and more business expected to be retained in the United States. So you have to apply the higher U.S. tax rate than elsewhere in the world and some of the changes to our internal reinsurance programs as well. Elyse Greenspan : And then last question. You guys spoke of kind of expanding in the reinsurance side. It seems like property for the most case mixed at 01/01, but it sounds like you guys saw some opportunities to grow within the casualty and non-property related lines. But premiums written basis, what type of growth - I know you pointed to growth in the first quarter. As you think about the book that you put together, what type of premium growth do you envision for 2019? Dominic Addesso : We're not really giving out any guidance at this time on premium growth. Elyse Greenspan : Do you - can you ballpark it? Would it be lower than what you saw over the past year or you just don't want to give any kind of magnitude? Dominic Addesso : Let me say that on the reinsurance side, percentage growth is sometimes a difficult metric to really rely on. So a large quota share for example, like some of the newer transactions we did in 2018, gives a percentage growth that we may or may not be able to apply into the following year. So quota shares are kind of lumpy. More reliably would be - would be the insurance growth and since poor Mr. Zaffino over here, I think he is getting a little bit of a complex not being asked a question, maybe he could at least comment on the insurance side as to its growth prospects. Jonathan Zaffino : Sure. Thanks, Dom. Yes, Elyse, good morning. The view from our perspective is our growth is probably going to return to sort of a stronger than what you saw in the fourth quarter, probably mid-teens level. And remember, if you look at 2018 full calendar year, property is only roughly across the various underwriting divisions about 15%-ish of our premium writing. So by default, our growth at a mid-teens, high-teens level or the property book that is less than 15% of the total, you'll see even more impact of the diversifying effect Dom is referring to. So we see a lot of opportunities for growth across many different product areas, many different geographies. And as I commented on based on the underlying market conditions, we think it's an opportune time in many areas to pursue that growth. Dominic Addesso : The only other thing that I could say is that on the reinsurance side, we would anticipate that the growth would be slightly less than what we'd experience in the insurance side, with the caveat that if we come across a large quota share deal and/or if we reduce participation on an existing quota share deal, those numbers could change from that. I hope that's of help, Elyse, but that's the best we can do. Elyse Greenspan : 50 million of attritional losses, what you define as the non-cat cat losses. That was a Q4 number. Do you have the full year number? Or the other three quarters kind of offset each other? Dominic Addesso : Could you begin that question again? Because the beginning part of that question cut out on us. Elyse Greenspan : So you guys - Craig had pointed to I think in response to a question that there was $50 million of non-cat cat losses within the reinsurance segment in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if what the full year number is, like if there were non-cat cat losses for the first three quarters. Craig Howie : Elyse, this is Craig. You may recall in the first half of the year, so in other words, in the second quarter, we had taken down our accrual for those non-cat losses because we didn't really see anything in the first half of the year that related to our reinsurance book. We didn't touch the insurance book because they are more exposed to some of those smaller events because of the types of business that they write. But for the reinsurance book, we didn't see any of those major events in the first half of the year. Primarily what we saw were - was this activity that came through later in the year and got booked in the fourth quarter. Operator : We will now take our last question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Rob, dialing for Mike. Just one question. Our reinsurance market participants have talked about substantial retro insurance pricing increases in 2019. Are you seeing that as well? And if yes, how is that going to impact Everest from a financial standpoint? John Doucette : This is John. So we did see retro prices at 01/01 increase particularly on loss affected accounts. And how much they increased varied on the client where it's exposed, things like that. To the extent that your question involves our hedging, I'd remind you that we have kind of a multi-product structure duration, tenure in terms of our hedging. Mt. Logan basically stands [indiscernible] pursue with Everest, taking the same rates, terms, condition, pricing that Everest gets but for fees and profit commissions and things like that. So it will move accordingly. And then when it comes to things like our catastrophe bonds that are put in place on a multiyear basis, that rate was predetermined before the losses. A lot of these catastrophe bonds were put in place before 2017 and '18's events and those - basically the cost of that hedging is basically zero year-over-year since it's fixed pricing over a multiyear basis. Dominic Addesso : Thank you. I guess that finish with the calls. Let me just close out with some thoughts. I want to thank you for your participation. And as you heard this morning, underlying our results are fundamentally some very positive patterns emerging. I don't mean to be dismissive of cat losses and their impact, but as I mentioned before, a longer-term view including record cat events still reveals total value creation over the long term in the top quartile. Furthermore, as we've discussed this morning, our diversification efforts will serve to reduce volatility going forward. Our financial strength and resiliency allows us to respond to market conditions and take advantage of what I think are very - some very unique opportunities in both our reinsurance and insurance platforms. Our success in lines of business away from property cat and our now profitable insurance franchise are just the beginning of what I see as a major transformation endeavor. So thank you again for your participation, and look forward to our conversations over the weeks ahead. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Levenson. You may begin. Jon Levenson : Thank you and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2019 first quarter conference call. The Everest executives leading today\u2019s call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today\u2019s call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest\u2019s SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled on our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Jon. Good morning and welcome to the call. It was a very strong financial quarter for Everest with contributions to profit from reinsurance, insurance and investments. We also continue to increase our market profile, with top line growth in both our reinsurance and insurance businesses. My colleagues will provide the details on our results, but before they do, I want to point out a few important insights. The first relates to top line growth. Within the overall increases in gross written premium, there are classes of business being reduced, where the rates are inadequate, terms and conditions are challenged or, in some cases, the customers no longer desire to cover in whole or part. Nevertheless, given current market conditions, along with our meaningful capacity and experienced underwriting teams, Everest is seeing an increasing number of profitable opportunities with the result and increase in business overall. We are proud of the market position that we have built and appreciate the preferred status we have in the market with customers and intermediaries. Second is the underlying performance of our business. We have detailed the change in business mix over the past few years and the impact on the loss and acquisition cost ratios. I note that this quarter, the attritional accident year loss ratio of 59.2% is very consistent with the result for the full year 2018. This is noteworthy for two reasons. First is that our loss selections do not yet reflect any underwriting actions taken, which is typically recognized as improvements are realized. And second, the earned premium in this quarter still reflects a good portion of business at 2018 rates. Rate increases achieved at January 1 and April 1 reinsurance renewals and any further rate increases will be earned throughout the year providing additional improvement to the attritional results. Turning to rates, although it is by no means a traditional hard market, I am encouraged by how the industry is responding to loss activity and trends. While capacity is available, there is a discipline emerging from both balance sheet and third-party capital for cat-related business, in addition to pricing, improving terms and conditions which are essentially equivalent to rate improvement, are also gaining traction. Property pricing has been the most responsive. Although it has taken 2 years of losses to bring change to the underwriting and pricing of the most challenging areas, notably wildfire and the AOB and LAE issues in Florida. Beyond property, the pricing momentum is mixed. Classes of business where profitability is challenged are getting some much needed rate. There is also a renewed discipline around other classes, including commercial auto and professional liability, also reflective of poor results. Other sectors, including energy and excess casualty, are firming, in line with the recognition of advancing loss costs trends and a market that is tightening. And finally, the discipline in London precipitated by tightening capacity at Lloyds and the increase in migration of business from the admitted markets to the E&S space is adding momentum to an improving market. I\u2019m not declaring victory by any stretch, but it is encouraging to see both the primary and reinsurance markets demonstrating a rational response to the issues at hand. Everest is in a fantastic position to capitalize on this improving market due to our fundamental strengths. Our focus on balance sheet strength and financial security is the starting point. The bedrock of our business is a promise to pay, and to that end, we have kept ample levels of capital, low financial leverage and strong ratings. Over the long term, I am confident that shareholders have benefited from this conservatism as it has allowed Everest to access the best business even during times of market stress that otherwise could have gone elsewhere. Everest also has tremendous experience and long-standing relationships with the most important trading partners around the world. We have worked with some customers for over 40 years, and as a result, it\u2019s difficult to replicate highly diversified book of profitable business. And finally, Everest has and will continue to have a strategic focus on long-term performance with a willingness to absorb volatility over the short term. In an improving market, our capacity, relationships and long-term focus are a very powerful combination. One final thought worth highlighting is that Everest is increasingly known as a market leader within the Specialty Insurance segment. The RIMS conference this year certainly spoke to that dynamic. Last year, Everest Insurance achieved excellent growth and underwriting results. And here, in the first quarter, accident year results are likely better than market expectations and many of our specialty insurance peers. While our insurance operations may get overlooked by investors sitting alongside one of the largest and premier reinsurance franchises in the world, the reality is that our insurance group is trending to end the year at record profits and will likely end the year ahead of many of its peers. That is both a size and profit common. I urge you to run the comps and include it\u2019s fair share of investment income. Although Everest is clearly one entity, we have two distinct yet complementary businesses, and I encourage you to look at the value of each individually and the resultant sum of the parts. While both reinsurance and insurance benefit from being part of a larger group and the many synergies they create, they each have a great potential and value on their own and into the future. With that, I turn the call over to Craig. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom and good morning everyone. Everest had a solid quarter of earnings, with net income of $349 million for the first quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $210 million for the first quarter of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 17%. Net income included $74 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $19 million of capital losses in the first quarter last year. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the first quarter was $282 million compared to $220 million in 2018. This represents an annualized operating return on equity of 14%. These results were driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first quarter last year. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $196 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $108 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2019, Everest saw $25 million of catastrophe losses related to flooding in Australia compared to $100 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2018. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. We revised the ultimate loss estimates by event and by segment with no change in the overall loss estimates. Estimated net favorable prior year catastrophe development was offset by $24 million of adverse catastrophe development on the third quarter 2018 Japan loss events. No other events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold in the first quarter of 2019. Therefore, any losses arising from these events were covered in our attritional loss estimates, which include a load for estimates less than $10 million. The overall current year attritional combined ratio was 87.4%, up slightly from 87.1% in the first quarter of 2018. The attritional loss ratio remained relatively flat at 59.2%, in line with Dom\u2019s earlier comments, while the commission ratio of 22.5% was up slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to changes in business mix and contention commission adjustments in the reinsurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% and was lower than prior year due to the increase in earned premium. Our reported combined ratio of 88.7% was lower than first quarter last year, primarily due to the lower reported catastrophe losses in 2019. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $141 million for the quarter. This was based on our $19 billion investment portfolio, a new record for Everest. Investment income was 2% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year. This was partially offset by lower limited partnership income. Since some partnerships report income on a quarter lag, this quarter\u2019s results reflected the poor equity market performance of the 2018 fourth quarter. We would expect there to be improvement in the limited partnership income going forward if the public equity market trading conditions continue to improve in 2019. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3%, flat compared to 1 year ago. However, both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields were up year-over-year. On income taxes, the 12.5% effective tax rate on operating income was close to the 13% tax rate we expect for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $460 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $196 million in 2018. The increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders\u2019 equity for the group was $8.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $523 million or 7% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders\u2019 equity since year-end 2018 is primarily attributable to $349 million of net income and the sharp recovery in a fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital returned through $57 million of dividends paid and $60 million of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we purchased another $9 million of shares after the close of the quarter, for a total of $25 million year-to-date. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio, in addition to our robust cash flow. As Dom mentioned, the strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. An attestation to this is the affirmation of our A.M. Best A+ superior rating announced last week. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report a robust underwriting profit and solid premium growth for the Everest Reinsurance Division during the first quarter of 2019. Our business remains well-positioned for the current market and for what we see as the evolving trends over the near-term. While the improving market that is emerging today is not an across-the-board rate lift as we may have seen in years gone by, it nevertheless has the potential to be meaningful and sustainable. And this environment favors companies such as Everest, who have the breadth, depth, flexibility, size and innovation to capture evolving opportunities across all classes of business and territories. Everest\u2019s success in the current market is based on these fundamental strengths : a global brand and platform; long-standing, broad relationships with clients and brokers built up over the last four decades by deeply experienced underwriting teams around the world; meaningful capacity; diversified capital sources; and a strong balance sheet. This quarter, we continued to see the value of partnership with clients, where the reinsurance relationship is strategic for all involved. As our clients have seen pockets of capacity in certain areas reduced, they increasingly turn to Everest to solve their risk and capital needs. Our ability to withstand market stress and continue to provide meaningful, stable capacity over 45 years is of great value to our customers and their intermediaries. Reflecting on the latest two major renewals, January 1 and April 1, we are encouraged with the rate change trend in the market. While not a hard market by historical standards, increasing evidence of stabilization on both underlying business and reinsurance business continues. The market has been reconsidering rates on key parallels and is now painfully aware of the risks embedded in historically less conspicuous parallels such as wildfire. The result is a market requiring rate increases and improved terms and conditions on loss-affected business while maintaining generally stable to increasing prices in non-loss affected programs. Overall reinsurance market capacity remains tight as both traditional and alternative capital are recalibrating their assumptions on loss costs, exposures, risk assessment and various risk perils, particularly given the amount of catastrophe losses over the last 2 years. And they are becoming more selective as to who they will back and the terms and conditions with which they deploy capacity, which is a positive step in the evolution of the overall reinsurance market. The knock-on effect to non-cat lines is also noteworthy. The market\u2019s broad recognition that cat-exposed profit can no longer subsidize underperforming treaties and other lines of business is resulting in actions on terms, conditions and underlying rates if they have been inadequate on a standalone basis. At the same time, there is increased demand as our customers re-underwrite their primary books, apply rate increases and seek to manage their net exposure. Outside of traditional P&C classes, we also find the outlook on our mortgage business robust and continue to see a long runway in the mortgage space for us to deploy capacity profitably in the current forms as well as in new products, structures and distribution sources. Now for a review of our quarterly results. For the reinsurance division overall, we wrote $1.5 billion of gross premium and reported an 86.5% combined ratio. Premiums were up 9% on a constant dollar basis year-on-year, with casualty as strong contributor to the growth. Original casualty rates have seen pockets of improvement, with reinsurance terms and pricing stable and, in some cases, increasing. Lower catastrophe losses helped drive an improved reinsurance division underwriting profit of $177 million, and our overall attritional loss ratio was about flat at 84.7% despite a larger percentage of the earned premium coming from pro rata business, which typically runs to a higher attritional loss ratio. Growth was strongest in our U.S. operations, up 19%, largely due to proportional casualty treaties predominantly written in 2018. The overall combined ratio was stable, with our attritional loss ratio down slightly and the attritional combined ratio up 3 points mainly due to commissions, increasing from the greater mix of pro rata business. The international operations also exhibited strong growth, with premiums up 13% on a constant dollar basis. Increased demand for Facultative reinsurance was a large contributor to the quarter\u2019s growth. And dislocation of capacity in London and other markets improved the opportunities for Everest in many international territories. Results in the international reinsurance segment were impacted by $25 million of loss from the Townsville monsoon and flooding in Australia as well as from increased loss estimates related to the third quarter 2018 Japanese loss events. However, our attritional loss ratio was flat at 53%, and our attritional combined ratio was down 1 point to 78.6%. The Bermuda operations had a decrease in gross premium, dropping 9% on a constant dollar basis. However, the year-over-year comparison was affected by premium recognition timing as the first quarter 2018 premiums were bolstered by the timing of premium reported on certain large accounts. Our London and Dublin operations included in this segment showed growth, benefiting from the dislocation in new markets. Profitability metrics are skewed due to some large shifts in prior period cat reserve to other reinsurance segments. Our attritional loss ratio of 61.6% was up 2.5 points due to an increase in casualty and specialty writings. However, our attritional combined ratio of 87.4% improved slightly. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to the year for our reinsurance operations, and we remain well-positioned to capture rate improvements due to recent loss activity and overall favorable underlying market trend. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thanks, John and good morning. Our insurance operations are likewise pleased to report a strong start of the year. Our first quarter performance was excellent as measured across several metrics, most importantly the significant increase in underwriting profitability. This solid first quarter profit continued the trend we have demonstrated over the past 2 years, notably by delivering an underwriting profit in eight of the last nine quarters. Underlying growth was excellent in the quarter, and some of the heavier impacts of non-renewal activity lessened, although have not completely diminished. The Everest global insurance operations produced gross written premium of $595 million for the quarter, an 18% increase over the first quarter of 2018 and a 37% increase over the same period in 2017. As we have over the past 4 years, we continue to pursue thoughtful and disciplined growth within our chosen product segment across the entirety of our global operations. This is the strongest first quarter production we have experienced in our history, and it marks the 17th consecutive quarter of top line growth across a diversified palate of high-value product areas. Most importantly in the quarter, the solid growth, combined with outstanding execution, resulted in underwriting profit of $19 million, a 50% increase over the $13 million of underwriting profit in the first quarter of 2018 and a nearly fourfold increase over the first quarter of 2017. Further, our attritional loss in LAE ratio improved 1.1 points to 65%, reflecting the continued migration toward the higher value and diversified specialty books of business and the earned premium impact of these businesses into our results. The evidence shows that our confidence in pursuing the organic build of a world-class specialty diversified insurance organization has been justified. As we have reported on prior calls, our leadership and underwriting teams across the globe continue to execute well on their individual and collective mandates, particularly during times such as these where we are experiencing transitioning markets. Our teams remain focused on our opportunity set, measured by our robust submission flows across lines of business, continues to grow, something I\u2019ll touch on later. We look forward to build on this momentum throughout the year. Turning to the financial highlights, the global insurance operations produced $595 million in gross written premium in the first quarter, an increase of $90 million or 18% over first quarter 2018 again evidence of our growing relevance in the specialty insurance market. As in prior quarters, contributions remained quite balanced across the diverse group of property and casualty and accident and health underwriting divisions within our global insurance operations. In fact, aside from our program operation, Everest Underwriting Partners, where we\u2019ve taken underwriting actions in pursuit of improved profitability, every other major business segment in the Everest Insurance portfolio delivered growth above 15% over first quarter of 2018. Turning to net premiums, for the first quarter of 2019, net premiums written also grew by 18% to $457 million while net earned premium grew by $32 million or 8% to $425 million. Our reported GAAP combined ratio for the quarter was 95.6%, a solid improvement of 1.2 points over first quarter 2018 and nearly 3 points improved over first quarter 2017. The attritional combined ratio was also 95.6% in the quarter, a 2.4-point improvement over the first quarter 2018, attritional combined of 98% and an 80-basis point improvement over the full year 2018 attritional combined of 96.5%. The overall GAAP loss ratio for the first quarter of 2019 was 65%, effectively flat as compared to last year\u2019s 64.9%. The first quarter of 2019 attritional loss ratio ex cat improved further by 1.1 points over the first quarter of 2018 and a further 3.2-point improvement over first quarter 2017 results. As anticipated and discussed on prior calls, the downward drift on the attritional loss ratio continues. This is a result of an improved mix of business, the growing benefit from the many new businesses launched, the improving underlying rate dynamics and the strategic underwriting actions of the past 4 years. Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, an improvement of 1.3 points over the prior year period. This is in line with our full year 2018 expense ratio of 30.3%. The first quarter 2019 expense ratio remains very competitive in the specialty insurance market and reflects stabilization around the 30% mark regardless of continued significant investment and talent, new products, new geographies and new technologies. We continue to recruit and retain the best talent in the industry and have invested in modern office locations to assist our colleagues in serving our customers in their local geographies. To support our talented employees and to enhance our client value proposition, we have committed to a robust program of IT investments in both traditional infrastructure and a variety of cutting-edge and innovative technologies. It is through the hard work of colleagues and their tireless commitment to execution that we have been able to pair this investment and growth with an industry-leading expense ratio. I\u2019ll turn now to the market conditions, which are clearly painting a picture of an evolving market. One of the barometers used to draw this conclusion is our submission flows in the quarter, which amounted to our third highest on record. This was particularly acute in our various wholesale dedicated businesses, where submission activity is significantly increasing month-to-month. As for underlying rates, we largely experienced an improving Property and casualty and accident and health pricing picture across the organization, a trend that has continued from last year. The exception has been workers\u2019 compensation, where rates remained under pressure. However, our view of profitability within the line remains positive. Excluding workers\u2019 compensation, overall property and casualty renewal premium change, which includes exposure change, was 6.9% in the quarter. Pure rate change on the same basis increased by 5.5% in the quarter. Virtually, all lines showed quarterly improvement led by commercial auto, property and umbrella excess. Encouragingly, financial lines globally also showed strengthening, building on a trend that began in the last 2 quarters of 2018. This is the highest aggregate rate change we have seen in roughly 5 years. Finally, and this is something that we pay close attention to, terms and conditions also point to improvement, particularly in the property and excess casualty markets. The bottom line for us is that we are focused on achieving adequate technical pricing across our portfolio and are working diligently toward that objective every day. In conclusion, the first quarter 2019 showed continued progress on our journey, along with solid results. Our vision of building a leading specialty diversified insurance company has become a reality. We have demonstrated that our strategy is sound and, more importantly, that we can execute on that strategy as evidenced by our consistent underwriting profitability across 8 of the last 9 quarters. More importantly, we believe we are positioned with the right capabilities, products and, of course, talent to service our customers in this evolving market. We look forward to continuing our positive momentum and reporting back to you next quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jonathan for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with The Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. Just maybe a few questions. The first question is probably for Dom. In the opening remarks, you talked about how the 59.2% was obviously did not reflect some of the things we talked about. I was curious, and maybe this, ties to ties into insurance and reinsurance, how should we think about what would be sort of a normalized fully adjusted number if all the pluses and minuses were to have flown through the numbers? Dom Addesso : Amit, we don\u2019t forecast earnings or try to give you any specific guidance on the numbers. In large part, that\u2019s the job of you and many others. I think what we\u2019re trying to suggest is that our first quarter numbers, not surprisingly, would be consistent with our 2018 loss picks on an attritional basis. And I think what we\u2019re also trying to suggest is that we\u2019ve got ahead of us rate increases that were already some of which was came through in \u201818. We\u2019ve got rate increases coming January 1 and April renewals, and then of course, highly anticipated June account. So, I think what we\u2019re trying to suggest is that there should be improvement in that number. And that\u2019s somewhat, of course, dependent upon what the level of rate increases are, which we don\u2019t try to publicly prognosticate on a specific level of rate increase. So you\u2019re on your own. Amit Kumar : No, that\u2019s a fair point. I was probably trying to come up with the Q4 comments and back into maybe 2 or 3 points of improvement. The other question I had was the discussion on reinsurance pricing and the upcoming 6/1 renewal. The 6/1 reinsurance premiums have [obviously seen a growth] substantially for the Q2 2018 versus Q2 2017. I was curious, based on how you\u2019re thinking about capital deployment, is it going to be more about risk selection at 6 at the upcoming renewal and, net-net, your size of the book remains mostly unchanged? Or how should we think about that? Dom Addesso : Well, that of course, Amit, is somewhat dependent upon what\u2019s presented to us at 6/1. As we\u2019ve said, we certainly would anticipate some meaningful rate activity and terms and conditions, which are improving, which essentially is rate. But naturally, that will vary by client. So, in some cases, the level of rate activity will vary by client, I guess is where I\u2019ll try to leave that. Our activity at 1/1 reflected some reduction in our exposure, as you could see from our PML\u2019s disclosures. And that was, of course, due to the fact that we did not achieve the level of rate increase that we felt was necessary. And on a risk-adjusted basis, some of the accounts were non-renewed. Whether or not that present itself in the same way at 6/1, not very likely. We certainly anticipate 6/1 will be much stronger than what we saw at 1/1. And what we saw at 4/1, by the way, were meaningful rate increases. And in fact, Japan was an area, for example, where we had pulled back in more recent times due to risk-adjusted pricing going down, but we actually increased slightly our participation in Japan at 4/1. So, it\u2019s a mixed bag. It\u2019ll be dependent upon what the market opportunities present to us. But I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll necessary, see us meaningfully increase our exposure. Amit Kumar : That\u2019s a fair point. The final question might be for Craig or John. The $37 million positive movement in the catastrophes in the U.S. reinsurance, where is that from? Craig Howie : So, Amit, we go through a comprehensive approach this is Craig to review our cat reserves on a current year basis but also in prior years as well. And we go through them. We look at each of them. However, we reserve on a group-level basis, not a segment-level basis. These events do not always fit neatly into a segment because the exposure can be written from multiple segments. We tend to react quickly to any adverse development, as you saw from the Japan loss events from 2018 that we took a charge for, but we take our time to react to any favorable development until that position becomes more mature. So, you may see movements between segments, but it\u2019s really done at an overall level. Amit Kumar : Okay. So that $37 million is from several pluses and minuses, I think is what you\u2019re saying versus one single event? Craig Howie : Correct. Amit Kumar : Got it okay I will stop here thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Craig Howie : Thank you, Amit. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi good morning. My first question, I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on the forward pricing environment. I recognize we\u2019re still on discussions for the midyear renewals. But given what we\u2019ve seen in the industry with Irma and the development with Irma, I mean can you give us a sense what kind of price increases would you need to see for this to be a successful renewal versus prices? If we get closer to 6/1 and prices fall short of expectations, is there a certain bar where Everest is going to walk away if they\u2019re not able to recoup price increases after 2 successive years of losses? Dom Addesso : So, Elyse, I\u2019m going to ask John to comment John Doucette to comment, but let me just say that consistent with what I\u2019ve said before is that we try not to prognosticate where the rate increases will be going and frankly where they even need to be. It varies by client, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, depending upon client experience, other relationships, risk-adjusted returns, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And frankly, it doesn\u2019t really do us any service to be trying to put a specific number or bar on it. I think it probably telegraphs an inconsistent message or an incorrect message to The Street. And frankly, it perhaps depending on the client relationship, it could be the inappropriate target for a specific client. So, it doesn\u2019t really serve our purpose to be putting a benchmark or drawing a line in the sand, so to speak, as you described. But John, do you have any further... John Doucette : Yes, and thanks, Dom. Elyse, thanks for the question. First, I do want to highlight that there\u2019s actually been 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, not 2, with Matthew, Irma and Michael. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of movement there, and I think there\u2019s been \u2013 as Dom said, as we look at this, we need to achieve the rates that we expect at, and that will vary by client. That will vary by product. That will vary by attachment. But we fully intend to differentiate the clients in terms of how they have performed with their losses, with their LAE, with AOB, with their loss creep, et cetera. So that will all factor in. We clearly see capacity tight as we head into the market both as I touched on in my earlier comments, both on the traditional and in the alternative space for a variety of reasons due to some of the aforementioned reasons, but also just the reload the alternative capital and the lack of reload. So, a couple of other points, that we continue to look to where we want to allocate capacity and not just property that\u2019s not just by a client in Florida. And we are allocating more capacity to global clients, where obviously as Jon Zaffino articulated, deploying more capital and capacity on the insurance space. We\u2019re seeing increasing opportunities on the casualty reinsurance space and, as I said, on the mortgage space. So, all of that factors into a higher required return threshold for where we are headed into our Florida business. We don\u2019t predict rates, but we think it\u2019s going to be a very, very late renewal, potentially messy. And ultimately, we think it\u2019ll be profitable for us. Dom Addesso : The only thing I\u2019d add to add, Elyse, is that while it\u2019s maybe precisely on point to your question, hopefully this helps. I did describe earlier that we\u2019ve increased our participation in the Japan market. And there, we\u2019re seeing rate increases of 20% to 30%. So maybe that gives you some notion of our appetite and maybe perhaps what\u2019s needed generally. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then in terms of your Jebi development in the quarter, so if we look at where your initial loss sat, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of development across the industry, and so the development that we\u2019ve seen from you guys, smaller percentage of your initial loss, is there a difference in how you attach on treaties there? Or maybe the level of insured losses you\u2019ve used when you set up the reserve for the losses in the third quarter of last year? Just any guidance there that we should think about in terms of the development on Jebi? Dom Addesso : So, we believe that last year, when we established that reserve, we were at the high above frankly, we\u2019re way above where the industry estimates were at the time. So that obviously kept us in good stead as well as the fact that we\u2019ve essentially when you look at the losses in Asia, we\u2019re looking at them as a group of losses as with respect to that marketplace. So, I think all of those factors combined enabled us to have that managed appropriately. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My last.... Dom Addesso : Give me one second. I think maybe John Doucette... John Doucette : Yes, and I just want to give a little bit of a frame of our market share in Japan. So, if you think back since over many years, we had post, the Tohoku earthquake substantial rate increases, and we significantly increased our book of business then. And then over the last several years, there had been a downward pressure on the rates. And we, accordingly, kind of turned our books each year a little bit for the worst performing accounts, and we also were moving up capacity, which I think is reflective of where we find ourselves for the Japanese book overall. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my last question was on the expense ratio. It was up a little bit year-over-year. And then if I look within the U.S. reinsurance segment, you saw an uptick a decent amount uptick in the commission and brokerage ratio from where you\u2019ve been trading. Is there something going on there that we should think about in terms of modeling going forward? Craig Howie : So, Elyse, this is Craig. Expenses year-over-year, one of the things that you saw at year-end, was variable pay expenses, where we\u2019re taking down at the end of last year, predominantly due to the profitability of the book. Those are back in normal, ranges for this year overall, but what you\u2019re seeing is just a slight uptick in expense dollars. But overall, the expense ratio is staying at a low level of 5.7% overall. John Doucette : Yes, and Elyse, this is John. I just want to add a little more color on the mix change. So, we also have been talking about increasing our casualty book of business overall, increasing our pro rata business. And at 1/1, we took action based on rates tied to our property retro and aggregate retro portfolio, and that decreased. The combination of those, all those, do have or did have an impact on the attritional combined ratio. Dom Addesso : And the expense ratio, of course, is... Craig Howie : Is down year-over-year. Dom Addesso : Is down over year. But the commission ratio had a and I think you referenced the U.S. reinsurance, that had a contingent commission adjustment in the first quarter, a true-up, if you will, due to the mortgage book. Elyse Greenspan : And how much was that true-up? Craig Howie : Overall, it relates to a bunch of things. It relates to contingent commission and the mortgage true-up, but it\u2019s also relates to the business mix that we had with more pro rata business coming on the books that John just mentioned. John Doucette : And different classes of business that specifically have contingent commissions in them. Dom Addesso : So, we don\u2019t have one specific number for the mortgage adjustment. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for all the color. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Elyse. Craig Howie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess this question is a multi-part question. So, first, just looking at the total reinsurance underlying attritional combined ratio of 87.4%, it just seems a little bit lower than the roughly 87% number that I think we had run rated last quarter. So, other than maybe contingent commissions or a couple of other minor \u2013 are there any major drivers there that, that would have resulted in this significant improvement quarter-to-quarter? John Doucette : No, I mean, we continue to deploy more capacity into the mortgage space, which we think has a robust risk reward characteristic. And as you may recall, the mortgage book are basically multi-year deal. They\u2019re over several years. So, deals from 3 years ago were still getting earned premium, 2 years ago, et cetera, 1 year ago, as well as writing new premium. That certainly has the directional impact of improving the attritional combined ratio given the potential profitability in the mortgage portfolio. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Dom, from your earlier comments, it sounds like between the underwriting actions that you\u2019ve taken and has been implemented starting in January and the rate increases that you\u2019ve been seeing, you are expecting an overall improvement. So basically, you are expecting that rates will be an excess of loss trends. Is that kind of broadly true? Are there lines of business or geographies where you actually don\u2019t see that to be the case? Dom Addesso : Not in any meaningful way. I think generally \u2013 and that\u2019s primarily because in any particular class of business in a particular geography, and of course, this can get pretty minute. But if that were the case then you\u2019d be seeing us take capacity move it away from those from that sector. I\u2019m not sure that I could really highlight anything that\u2019s moving in the wrong direction. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then I guess one last quick one. I think the increase in losses from Japan is for all 3 industry events, so Jebi, Trami and then the flood losses. Would you be able to break that out? Dom Addesso : We do not break that out. Yaron Kinar : Okay. But if I take the 3 industry events together, it would seem like you are in the 80 basis point to 90 basis point market share of those 3 losses based on current estimates. Is that roughly how you\u2019re seeing it? Craig Howie : Roughly 1%. Yaron Kinar : Roughly 1%, okay. Thank you very much. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks. Just looking for a little bit more color on the texture behind the Japan book now at renewals maybe in terms of premium size, how much of that is quota share? What\u2019s the weighting between the wind and the quake and how much of that \u2013 if it\u2019s excess of loss is aggregate or occurrence? John Doucette : Good morning, Ryan, this is John. So, our Japan book is about $60 million \u2013 $50 million to $60 million, up slightly this year over prior years. The mix would be \u2013 I don\u2019t have that in front of us. The mix would be mostly excess of loss business and that\u2019s mostly property. There\u2019s some other surety, fidelity and some other smaller programs that we write for a lot of the major clients. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. And then a follow-up for Dom, going back to the prepared remarks about \u2013 thinking about these 2 businesses from a similar parts context. I\u2019m just curious, like what is your ROE outlook on \u2013 where the primary insurance business is today and where the reinsurance business is? Dom Addesso : Well, first of all, our \u2013 we would certainly target an ROE in the double-digits. Clearly, we would expect a higher ROE out of our reinsurance business and the insurance business given the volatility there. A couple of 100 basis point difference, but that\u2019s about as specific as I think I\u2019d want to get without giving you a specific number, which would then, of course, translate into an earnings projection. Ryan Tunis : Fair enough. Thanks. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : Yes, good morning, everybody. Dom Addesso : Good morning. Joshua Shanker : I want to talk a little bit about pricing, obviously, both sides of the markets. First of all, in terms of the rate increases on the primary inside and it\u2019s not just for you, but others, to what extent are broadly discussed industry price increases going to get mitigated by higher outwards reinsurance costs, which you guys will benefit from? And two, in absence of property pricing being up, I\u2019m sure in your non-property lines, you had all seen price increases, but would it be business as usual or is there really something palpable going on outside of the property-driven pricing markets? Jonathan Zaffino : Good morning, Josh, this is Jon. Let me take that from the primary side. First and foremost, I don\u2019t see this as a reinsurance-driven pricing change. I think some of the underlying fundamental dynamics are such that there are a number of areas that just simply needed to correct the rate action. So, we\u2019re seeing that across several lines, some of which I mentioned in my script, we\u2019re actually seeing some of the momentum actually built, which is \u2013 which fundamentally I think is creating a pretty interesting dynamic and outlook. So, we anticipate that to continue as the year moves on and we\u2019re seeing it outside of property. We mentioned the commercial auto, not a new story obviously. But as I mentioned earlier, in the financial lines, you\u2019re starting to see particularly in some of the management liability areas, public company D&O, certainly primary layers, you\u2019re starting to see increased rate of change happening there in terms of rate action. So, we just see it\u2019s sort of a broad-based move, but a lot of it being driven by underlying fundamentals versus kind of a top-down view. Joshua Shanker : And even though it\u2019s not being driven by the reinsurance side, are your clients going to see some of their rate-driven margin expansion curtailed by higher outwards reinsurance costs? Dom Addesso : Well, there would be \u2013 we would expect the industry \u2013 the primary industry to obviously realize some of the reinsurance rate increases. I\u2019m not so sure that, that would translate into margin compression on their end. I think their rate levels, clearly, the reinsurance spend is only a portion of their gross written premium. But I think the economics are such that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect any compression for their margin because of increased reinsurance pricing. Joshua Shanker : Fair enough. Jonathan Zaffino : And I think \u2013 and John Doucette can speak more to this, but I \u2013 everyone buys differently. So, I think it\u2019s a very difficult translation of one-to-one. So, I don\u2019t know, John, if you want to comment on the demand side. John Doucette : Yes. What we\u2019re clearly seeing a lot of our clients, reinsurance clients, looking to grow \u2013 to buy more frankly, grow their reinsurance treaties and some of them are property-driven for volatility. Interestingly, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand on the casualty side of the house. And that is resulting in \u2013 so to your \u2013 to the original question, we\u2019re still seeing non-property rate improvement with improved terms and conditions and lower ceding commissions on the casualty, the broader casualty part. And then we\u2019re also seeing some pick-up in some of the specialty reinsurance areas, aviation, marine, et cetera. We\u2019re seeing some lift, some of that\u2019s really loss-driven. So, we\u2019re seeing some opportunities there that we wouldn\u2019t have found attractive in prior years, but at a better pricing, we could put more capacity to work there. Dom Addesso : The one area, Josh, where you may see some of which you\u2019re suggesting could be in Florida with some of the smaller companies, where they may feel a little bit of pressure from rising reinsurance costs, but that would be the only spot where I think that would potentially go through. Joshua Shanker : Alright, well, thank you for the answers. Dom Addesso : Thank you, Josh. John Doucette : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I was hoping you could give us an \u2013 your views on the sophistication of the Japanese catastrophe models compared to the ones we\u2019ve got for the Southeastern United States? John Doucette : So, let\u2019s start with first, all models are wrong. And every time a loss happens, some of the weaknesses get demonstrated and then there\u2019s kind of a look back and a retooling back to cover the losses that happened. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we take a pretty holistic view on \u2013 across the whole board and really try to think about it on a first principle basis and so not just be model-driven. So, our \u2013 I think the data is getting better over time overall, but it\u2019s still not nearly as good in a lot of international areas as it is in the U.S., that would include Japan. But it has gotten a lot better over the last several years and the models therefore are also better. Meyer Shields : No, great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, I think it\u2019s \u2013 my impression at least is that, you tend to see reinsurance buyers or really all insurers get somewhat more optimistic in their loss picks during soft markets and then that reverses when rates rise. Can you talk about how you sort of manage against that in the reinsurance book? Dom Addesso : Well, I mean, it\u2019s an interesting observation, and, of course, selecting an ELR and knowing the true cause of business, cost of goods sold in this business is something that you never really know for years into the future. So, you never really know accurately your cost of goods sold and it\u2019s always a challenge. So, the best way to deal with that is to use all the tools that are available to you, stay true to your process, be conservative and disciplined around how you establish loss reserves and just collect all the data you can. And I think what we\u2019ve shown and demonstrated is that in our attritional book, we have a fairly good track record over the last half a dozen years or so of reasonably reserving through various market cycles. But look it\u2019s never an exact science and it\u2019s all about being presenting the fair financial picture, which we think we\u2019ve done. John? John Doucette : Just to add a little more color, we also benefit \u2013 and this is where I think data and experience with clients, clients\u2019 business in different territories, I mean, we write this business for over 45 years. We write in basically all P&C lines in all territories and have traded with 70% of our clients for decades now. And that\u2019s incredibly helpful because we can pull up prior year submissions. We can pull up similar clients and we can look and build. So, I think being \u2013 having a global footprint for a long period of time gives us a very strong insight into what we think the market really is, the loss pick really is and the rating environment really is, which I think has helped us time and time again being in that favorable position to be able to execute on that and not just rely specifically on what a specific client information tells us, but to be able to pull in across kind of our institutional knowledge on actuarial pricing and trends \u2013 loss trends and whatnot. Dom Addesso : And to be specific about our process and I know we\u2019ve mentioned this from time to time, what we do in our process is that after the last reserve study and this will apply to every class of business, we then apply to that last reserve study selection, we apply what\u2019s happening with rates. So, if there are rate decreases going on in the marketplace, we will take the last reserve study pick and adjust it downward or upward, I\u2019m sorry, for any rate decreases and the opposite if there are rate increases going on. So, that\u2019s how we deal with it specific to our company. Meyer Shields : Okay. That was very thorough and helpful. Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one quick question here. John, what do you think the impact of the AOB legislation in Florida is going to have on just the pricing environment to the kind of loss cost stuff going forward? John Doucette : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Again, we try to absorb all the information out there. We don\u2019t really try to make specific predictions on what this is going to do or what that is going to do in a while. I\u2019ll go back to 3 years of hurricanes hitting Florida, a lot of capacity, the loss creep that we did see, I think capacity is tight, as Dom alluded to, a lot of the reinsurance clients there, their reinsurance programs are capital for them, and I think they need to be reflective of the not-so-great experience over the last couple of years. We certainly hope and we think it\u2019s a positive move that the Florida legislature is addressing this issue. So, hopefully, that\u2019ll make an overall better healthier market in the long-term. Brian Meredith : I guess most specifically, do the quota shares actually done in Florida, do you think it\u2019ll have any impact on pricing then or are you going to kind of just wait and see what happens call it a year from now? John Doucette : I think there could be \u2013 I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know if your question was insurance pricing, the original pricing or reinsurance pricing. Brian Meredith : Yes. John Doucette : I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 I\u2019m \u2013 there\u2019s going to be directional movements up and down on all that stuff. But again, I think the capacity is tighter at this renewal. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Dom Addesso : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Dom Addesso : Good. I\u2019ll just sum up here. Thank you for joining this morning and for your questions and discussion. Certainly, we\u2019re off to a good start for the year, but more important is what is likely to unfold as the year progresses. And I think as you have heard from us and other market participants the rate outlook is quite positive. This along with our many business initiatives and expansion opportunities causes us to be very optimistic about our future. So, I look forward to interacting with many of you in the weeks ahead and have a good day. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson, please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Thank you, Sinead, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures these items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that I turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dom Addesso : Thanks Jon. Good morning and welcome to our call this morning where we are pleased to outline the excellent results we had for the quarter. As you've no doubt seen by now, our net income per share for the quarter was $8.39 resulting in an ROE of 16.1%. This combined with the first quarter equaled almost $17 per share and a 16.5% ROE. The quarter saw a continued underwriting profitability in both our Reinsurance and Insurance divisions along with a very strong level of investment income. My colleagues will give many of the details underlying our success, but let me say that we continue to execute successfully on our strategy. For Reinsurance, it has been a diversification effort and over time, has seen growth in casualty, mortgage and non-cat property and of course our strategic repositioning in the insurance space which began just over four years ago is now hitting its stride. Given our scale, ratings, global franchise and diversification in all our businesses, we can capitalize on the rate momentum we are now seeing in the market. Rate activity, we are seeing; however, is still spotty and in several instances not yet at levels they need to be. Nevertheless, this certainly appears to be a market that will continue to see Re. Our observation of capacity pullbacks and an increasing flow into the facultative market and the E&S markets are encouraging signs, perhaps not a classical hard market but given industry reserve positions, capital levels and frankly better analytics. The amplitude of prior pricing cycles is likely being replaced with more timely actions. I believe that is in part what we are seeing now. An element of this is also in reaction to loss trend. There has been much discussion about loss trend over the last couple of weeks. No doubt it is evident in many classes but to varying degrees and while everyone is looking for a Point estimate, there will undoubtedly be varying numbers based on book profile, class, attachment point et cetera. As a general comment our rate increases are for the most part, above trend. In addition, we would expect that loss trend to continue and accordingly rate increases will likely persist. My colleagues will get into the many details on our results. But it is worth emphasizing that over the past several years, we have continued to diversify and reduce volatility. One measure of that is our expected annual cat loss which just a few short years ago was 12 points as a percentage of premium and now stands at approximately 6.5 points. The end result is less volatility and improved profit targets. Our reinsurance division has successfully diversify this portfolio. As I mentioned earlier and our insurance segment now at over 30% of our business. Is growing profitably. At its current pace, as I mentioned in last quarter the sum of the parts should prove to be quite positive. Thank you. And now to Craig for the financial highlights. Craig Howie : Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another solid quarter of earnings with net income of $343 million in the second quarter of 2019. This compares to net income of $70 million for the second quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $692 million compared to $280 million for the first half of 2018. Net income included $100 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $9 million of capital losses in the first half of 2018. The 2019 capital gains were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $321 million compared to $40 million in 2018. Operating income year-to-date was $603 million compared to $260 million for the first six months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized operating income, return on equity of 14.4%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the Group, stable core investment income, a higher contribution from private equity investments and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first half of 2018. The overall underwriting gain for the Group was $393 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $20 million in the same period last year. In second quarter of 2019, the company reported $30 million of net adverse catastrophe development. The catastrophe losses were primarily reported in the international reinsurance segment and related to Typhoon Jebi, which occurred in Japan during the third quarter of 2018. The industry loss estimates for this event rose significantly again this quarter. The initial estimates for Jebi were $3 billion to $7 billion and at that time, we estimated a conservative estimate based on an $8 billion industry loss. We have now reestimated our share of the Typhoon Jebi losses in line with the high end of the new industry range of $14 billion to $16 billion. Although we have number of loss events in the quarter, including U.S. storm events, none of these events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold and as such are included in our attritional loss estimates. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $55 million compared to $597 million during the first half of 2018. Partially offsetting the catastrophe losses was $22 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to non-catastrophe reserves. This prior year favorable development was primarily identified for reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2019. These reserves related to casualty and property reinsurance business both in the United States and internationally. The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have developed over time, but we don't revise estimates until the reserve position becomes more mature. We continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development the underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio through the first six months was 88% compared to 87% for the full year of 2018. The attritional loss ratio of 59.5% and the commission rate ratio of 22.8% were up slightly compared to the same period last year. Primarily due to business mix in the reinsurance segment which has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters. The Group expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2019. This is flat compared to the same period last year. Our year-to-date reported combined ratio of 88.9% was driven by the strong underwriting performance of both our reinsurance segment and our ... insurance segment. Before moving onto investment income, I'd like to point out that we included two new pages in our financial supplement Pages 6 and 11. These pages detail gross written premium by major lines of business, for the total Reinsurance and Insurance segments. This provides background detail to the business mix shift and the resulting combined ratio changes we've been referencing. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $179 million for the quarter and $320 million year-to-date on our $19.8 billion investment portfolio, a new record portfolio size for Everest. For the year-to-date, investment income was up $40 million or 14% from one year ago. This result was primarily driven by the increase from the investment grade fixed income portfolio which had a higher asset base this year. Additionally, we've seen a recovery and limited partnership income which was up $11 million for the first half - from the first half of 2018, as we expected and mentioned in the first quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 3.4% compared to 3.1% one year ago, as both investment grade and alternative fixed income yields are up year-over-year. The duration of the portfolio remains at just over three years. On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is associated with the amount and geographic region of the underwriting gains and the investment income, expected to be earned for the full year. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation and includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Lower-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend higher than the current 12% rate. Positive cash flow continues with record operating cash flows of $854 million for the first half of 2019 compared to $133 million in 2018. The increase reflects our growth in premiums and a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, another record for Everest, up almost $1 billion or 12% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity. In the first half of 2019 is primarily attributable to $692 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return for $114 million of dividends paid as well as $25 million in share buybacks. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position with industry low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio in addition to our robust cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for the Reinsurance Division with $178 million of underwriting profit in Q2. And further diversification of our portfolio providing stability and balance to our operation. Our global franchise is well positioned and new initiatives, underwriting actions and rate increases. We are finally seeing both the property and casualty reinsurance markets move positively. Reflecting a combination of recent catastrophe losses, capacity shortages, trapped capital, pockets of poor loss experience and new found discipline from some of the largest players in both insurance and reinsurance. The upshot is improving original insurance rates which Jon Zaffino will touch on later and better reinsurance rate terms and conditions in several parts of our portfolio. In Florida, we were pleased with our June renewal. Overall, the market was rational with pricing up. We saw a more risk adjusted rate increases on loss affected treaties and increases on many others, but there was a wide range of outcomes with some programs remaining underpriced. I think of this not as a hard market but as a reasonable market. Finding its way back to a sustainable balance between serving clients needs and generating appropriate returns on reinsurance capital therefore, we continued our practice of allocating capital to long-term strategic clients and the deals with the best returns. Our underwriting and modeling teams did a great job positioning Everest to capture more of the best business while shedding less attractive deals, the end result was a reduction of Everest exposure to property gap and an effort to encourage rate discipline through scarcity of our capacity. On some deals we achieved tighter terms and conditions such as LAE cap and lower current limits on proportional treaties. Consequently, we are encouraged with the direction of the Florida market, but more improvement is needed given several years of Deterioration, rate pressure and loss cost inflation. Nevertheless, the bottom line for our Florida book is a higher ROE and a reduced model cat loss. We achieved portfolio rate increases that outpace the overall market by strongly differentiating programs through disciplined underwriting. We are pleased that model profitability remains relatively flat despite meaningful reductions to our catastrophe exposures. Switching to July 1st, outside of Florida, U.S. property, renewals were orderly and directionally positive. Rates were up mid-to- high single-digits on a risk adjusted basis. Property business at July 1, outside of the U.S. was generally stable. With rate increases driven by loss activity or the reunderwriting mandated from some of the Lloyd's Syndicate. As mentioned previously, during the April 1st renewals for Japan, Everest did employ more capacity there given the improved rates. And the Japanese market is preparing for potentially further rate increases for upcoming renewal. Due to recent loss experience particularly the industries loss creep on JEBI. In the U.S. casualty lines trends remain positive. Despite plentiful potential capacity, the market has grown more discipline in both reinsurance and insurance, as primary rates improve across most line. Casualty reinsurance terms are stable for non-loss affected business; however, poor performance and increasing loss trends over the last several years are prompting reinsurers increase rates and decreased commission because of Everest, 40 plus year history, strong balance sheet and ratings, large market presence, robust, long-term client relationships and responsive underwriting we continue to garner preferential access on casualty reinsurance business. As we have previously discussed, until about 18 months ago. We have been reducing our casualty writings over the last several years prior to that due to the deterioration in both the insurance and reinsurance casualty markets. This has helped us avoid much of the poor loss experience that has emerged and we are now very well positioned to deploy our underwriting expertise and capacity as the casualty markets improve. In addition to casualty we have significant opportunity in mortgage business shown by the 16% growth in mortgage writings during the first half of this year. Also of note is the evolution and strong growth of our facultative book globally over the past several years. We have several very experienced fact teams worldwide who are product experts and local market specialist. We now have over $430 million of facultative reinsurance premium in-force, covering property casualty, professional, specialty and order lines across Miami, New York, New Jersey and several other offices in the U.S. as well as in Toronto, Singapore and London. This is an all-time high gross written premium for our facultative book after meaningful growth during the last few years. And it is well diversified as our global back book is broadly split by line approximately 60% casualty and 40% property. And it is also split geographically 60% international and 40% U.S. meaningful improving back opportunities emerged following dislocation in Lloyd's the 2017 and 2018 cat losses and general decrease in D&F capacity. Tax submission flow is up significantly in all territories in line highlighted by the 26% year-to-date increase in U.S. that fac casualty submissions. On the demand side, our fac clients are seeking both short and long tail limit reduction and exposure management, particularly in auto due to poor experience increased demand is broad based across back including property, casualty, individual risk auto fac, U.S. placements and placements from abroad. Our growth in facultative business exemplifies our ability to capitalize on opportunity around the globe. Writing all P&C lines of fac in key centers all over the world requires a robust global infrastructure and it's hard for competitors to replicate which gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. Our strong growth in fac is more evidence of an improving overall reinsurance market as Dom mentioned earlier, because fac renewals happen much more often than treaty renewal they are good leading indicators of market trend. We are bullish that this improving trend in fac will continue well past 2020, particularly as tough exposures meet limited capacity in the firming treaty market. During the second quarter Everest purchased an aggregate property retro program that will help protect us from a large catastrophe loss or series of mid-sized losses. This retro program was designed to refine the shape of our portfolio by further diversifying our capital structure, reducing that volatility, adding flexibility to deploy our capital for interesting and unique opportunities. This retro purchase aids to be better positioned to capture improvement opportunities in the property space, including at January 1, 2020, given the retro market dislocation and trapped capital while managing the volatility of our property book with the combined financial strength of our shareholders. Common equity, Mt. Logan capital Kilimanjaro cat bonds ILWs, facultative retro protection and now this additional aggregate retro capacity, we are well capitalized and not reliant on any one capital source to finance our underwriting risks. Moving on to our year-to-date results, our global reinsurance operations at growth of 3% on written and earned premium during the first half of 2019. Growth came from U.S. operations with increased casualty and mortgage writings offset by slightly less premium in treaty property as we push rate and in Bermuda due to some non-renewal of some - of a few large deals . we booked in 86.6% combined ratio for reinsurance operations with cat losses of $55 million which included losses from the Townsville monsoon, Australian flooding and some loss - some additional loss development from Typhoon Jebi as the market loss worsen significantly just as Craig mentioned earlier these cat losses mostly impacted our international segment. Excluding catastrophe losses, the underlying loss ratio of 57.4% for reinsurance operations increased by 0.4 points compared to the full year of 2018. Given the greater mix of casualty and pro rata business in our portfolio. We continue to be viewed by clients and brokers all over the world as a core go-to trading partner and garner increased opportunities particularly with dislocations of capacity around the world in multiple lines of business. These dislocations and pressure on supply of risk capital include one dislocation due to lower large scale rationalization impact and direct and facultative capacity And many international portfolios helping to drive improvements in the E&S Primary and facultative books, two ongoing trapped capital from 2017 and 2018 losses and the subsequent market loss deterioration are pushing ILS investors to retrench, withdraw capacity for demand better pricing and terms the resulting dislocation in several property reinsurance market and global retro capacity will likely continue for the upcoming January renewal. Three, some European reinsurers have been pulling back casualty and professional reinsurance capacity decreasing authorizations on specific programs were pushing casualty rates and terms, which is leaving potential in some clients treaties and creating some upward pressure on casualty rates both of which provide attractive opportunities. Four, some reinsurers our now bumping up against internal risk capacity limits or rating agency constraints for mortgage causing reduced involvement on new mortgage deal. We believe this mortgage reinsurance capacity constraints for some rated carriers will continue or even grow. Each of these or taken separately and certainly together present robust prospects for profitable growth opportunities for a large global reinsurers with strong capital high ratings and dry powder. In summary, we are pleased with not only our year-to-date results but also with our strategic positioning for the future. Despite this evolving market we remain focused on building long-term value for our shareholders while being the first call for our clients and broker partners. Thank you and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thanks Jon and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered another solid quarter of performance. We continue to experience high quality, profitable growth within our many retail and wholesale underwriting divisions across North America and several international markets. Our growth remained balanced and diversified by geography, product segment and distribution channel. Our insurance operations are well positioned to continue on this path of growth and profitability as clients increasingly rely on Everest Insurance to offer solutions to help them address a growing range of complex risk issues. Our leading balance sheet formidable global infrastructure and outstanding talent, nearly 1,000 strong are increasingly in demand in this transitioning market. The second quarter brought some notable performance achievements highlighted by record reported gross and net written premiums as well as net earned premium. We also experienced the highest level of quarterly submissions across our retail and wholesale operations coupled with the strongest renewal retention. We have experienced, and more than five years and our U.S. direct operations. This speaks to the growing role Everest Insurance plays in the global specialty market. The second quarter also continued a nearly five year trend or 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in our business. This focused growth is the result of increased scale and relevance within the many underwriting divisions across our global property and casualty and accident and health operations. We believe significant additional scale can be achieved within our chosen product areas. Allowing us to maintain excellent growth rates into the future. Of course, market conditions dependent. Most importantly and this quarter builds upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our year-to-date underwriting profit to $38 million, a 72% increase over prior year first half. Our second quarter underwriting profit was $19 million, a more than two fold increase over 2018 second quarter and $16 million more that our 2017 second quarter performance. Further, nine of the last 10 quarters have now produced an underwriting profit, the lone exception being the 3rd quarter of 2017. An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry-leading talent. Everest Insurance and the greater Everest organization remains a highly desirable home for talented professionals. Across a range of disciplines in fact, hundreds of talented colleagues have chosen to join Everest Insurance over the past several years and we are proud to welcome them into the Everest family. These talent acquisition efforts continue to fuel our growth, enable our capabilities and differentiate us by ensuring we have the right people in place to support our strategic initiatives, our ever expanding books of business and most importantly our growing client base. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a long-term effort and there is always room for further improvement yet we are certainly encouraged by our trajectory to date and are optimistic about our opportunities in the market ahead. Turning to the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date period. For the second quarter of 2019, the global insurance operations produced $757 million in gross written premium, an increase of $111 million or 70% Over second quarter of 2018. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to one $1.4 billion, a $201 million or 17% increase over the same period of 2018. Our net written premium growth matched our top line growth at 17% year-over-year increasing by $80 million to $549 million. Net earned premium in the quarter was $474 million, an increase of $65 million or 16% for the year-to-date period net earned premium increased to 899 million an increase of $97 million or 12% over the prior year period. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various business ventures incepted over the past several years, begin to earn through the P&L at a greater rate. Turning to the combined ratio, for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 96%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2018 and a 310 basis point improvement over the same period in 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP combined ratio was 95.8%, a 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year period and a 300 basis point improvement over the first half of 2017. The attritional combined ratios for the quarter and year-to-date period are 96% and 95.8% respectively. On the year-to-date basis we see an 80 basis point improvement over 2018 year-to-date results of 96.6%. The quarter's loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved 290 basis points from the prior year period to 65.8% from 68.7%. This includes the benefit of no cat losses in the current quarter, a result of thoughtful positioning of our various property portfolios. On a year-to-date basis, the 2019 attritional loss ratio of 65.4%, an 80 basis points improved over last year's 66.2%. Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter, and consistent with the full year of 2018 performance. We continue to take advantage of our improved scale to invest in people, technology and new locations in key markets across the globe. For the year-to-date period the expense ratio was 30.4%, down slightly from the 30.5% in the comparable period of 2018. As we expect that we are seeing the stabilization of our expense ratio year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as earned premium continues to come through as our businesses mature. Turning to the operating environment I would echo the sentiment you have heard from other companies, namely that the trading environment and trading conditions globally continue to improve, as respect to pricing I would break this down into three areas. First, we are seeing improved underlying pricing across all lines except workers' compensation. Second, we see accelerating price improvement in several areas across property, liability and professional lines. And third, for the first time in many quarters, our aggregate renewal price change, which includes exposure change has moved into positive territory registering 2.9% for the quarter, inclusive of workers' compensation. Excluding workers' compensation Everest Insurance produced an aggregate renewal price change of 8.1% in the quarter, which is the strong as we have seen in seven years. Year-to-date, the renewal price change as they likewise excellent 6.3%. Further, this continues the upward trend and non-workers' compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. And in fact the underlying rate change increased to 7% in the second quarter. In general, I would say the same themes we have discussed in prior calls are continuing to play out. However, the notable change is the increased momentum. Property lines, cat and non-cat exposed alike continue to gain meaningful rate as does commercial auto, both were up in the low-to-mid teens this quarter. The liability lines Primary and Excess are also beginning to achieve more significant rate, generally in the low-to-mid single digit range, as are the professional and financial lines. The financial lines initially lag other areas in terms of rate achievement, but are quickly beginning to adjust to the new reality of much needed rate to absorb increased loss cost. So overall, we see a much more constructive environment and as our renewal premium changes indicate, we are optimistic that this trend will continue in the quarters ahead. In conclusions stated simply, this is another quarter of strong growth, increased profitability and meaningful advancements toward our strategic objectives. We look forward to reporting back to you next quarter. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Sinead for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : My first question goes to the underlying or - your loss ratio and reinsurance. I guess we are seeing about 5.5 points of deterioration year-over-year. You called out business mix loss trend and non-cat weather. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude of each of those drivers and then maybe as a follow-up to that, how should we think about the 87% underlying combined ratio that you had talked about in the past given that I think it was a little bit in excess of that this quarter? Dom Addesso : This is Dom. I'll start and ask Mr. Doucette to - and Craig to complement wherever I say. But first of all, I think the comparison against the year ago quarter is a little bit difficult because of the number of adjustments that we made in the second quarter of last year. So we think the more appropriate comparison is to look at the full year, December of '18 against the six months of '18. So the gap that you described is much narrower. Again it's business mix shift, it's certainly conservative loss picks, less of a factor is any loss cost trend, but those are the main drivers of the movement and the other thing to keep in mind is that through six months we still carry fairly good size non-cat, cat loads so that's also reflected in the six months numbers. We're in the full year that tends to get equalized out. So those are some of the factors, I don't know if Craig or John want to add anything to that. John Doucette : Yes, it's John, good morning. Just one thing, I think we had about $32 million of reinstatement premiums in last year's Q2 which also skews, the comparison of just isolating the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Yaron Kinar : And then my other question is just with regards to premium growth in reinsurance. So I appreciate the color and the opening statements, and I realize that there are a bunch of offsets there. But, and this may be Monday morning quarterbacking here, but I guess I'm looking at the prior year had 137% growth and gross premiums, about 47% growth in net premiums, definitely saw a slowdown here even as rates have improved I guess how should we think about the rate, the premium momentum here and I guess, in hindsight, was the capital deployment in 2018 maybe too aggressive leading to some needed to slow down growth and '19? Craig Howie : Yaron, and this is Craig. Just, just to kick this off and then I'll let John jump in as well. But this is something that I think you have to look at. So, you mentioned the growth in the prior year. What I would say to you is the growth this year on a year-to-date basis is actually 5% if you exclude foreign exchange, so you're actually growing on top of that growth from prior year so that's, certainly something I'd ask you to look at. Yaron Kinar : Yes and too, I don't think this has anything to do with capital in terms of our deployment, it really is opportunity set and where we see it. And there's a - there is a - these are core renewal portfolio, there are some large one-off deals and this year, there were a couple of those deals that we didn't come to you know the renewal terms with the clients and so that again skews the numbers, which is one of the reasons we think it's better to look at the year-to-date numbers as opposed to the quarterly numbers. And we're actively talking to some clients about some large, complicated deals now, and so it could move the other way as well. So I - but it's absolutely not capital related. Okay. Dom Addesso : And one of the things I'd add to that, Yaron, is that you know reinsurance by its very nature can be a little lumpy, so I wouldn't necessarily look at any year-over-year increases in premium as some kind of a forecasting tool, if you look at our property pro rata. For example, that moves around a fair bit and to John's point if you can't come to term with a client on a particular deal then you've got to slug a premium that - pro rata can be lumpy. So you can have a slug of premium that can be here one year and gone the next. It's not particularly troubling. For us, again our franchises is one in which we continue - each and every year, we gained momentum in the marketplace across many different product sets. So the momentum is still quite fair. Operator : And now take our next question from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mike Phillips : I wanted to touch on the insurance side. I appreciate all the color there at the end with the conditions are improving. You mentioned - you mentioned three reasons why, I mean you said liability and professional lines, low-to-mid single-digit rates but much in it - much needed and loss costs are still rising. So, I guess all that in, if you look at the past. I don't know, 7, 8, 9 quarters. Your core loss ratio or your core combined ratio was around 96 or so and really hasn't moved much from there, I guess how do you think about, given the rate and loss trend environment in the insurance, when do you expect any kind of movement and improvement in that core loss and core combined ratio? Dom Addesso : I'll start and ask Mr. Zaffino to answer that. Our combined ratio and loss ratio is here again, also driven by mix. So in the insurance operation - by the way is a great, a great result and we're quite proud of it. But we've got this additional rate activity, rate increases coming into the market, we have not pull down our loss ratios to account for any of that we tend to be more conservative in our loss picks. So we continue to pick the same loss ratio on a higher premium base on the other hand, again to reflect some level of conservatism where comp with rate decreases we've actually increased our loss pick and will come, given the fact that they were rate decreases that we're facing. So we've kind of short sighted ourselves in a way there and then I guess the last point you mentioned or I mentioned already, but mix, so we have a bit more risk management business in our portfolio than we anticipated, which just by - and accident and health business, which by its very nature, books at a higher combined ratio still very profitable, consistently profitable business. So that's some of the reasons why perhaps we're not seeing as much movement as you would otherwise have expected in the combined. But nevertheless we are still anticipating continued improvement over the quarters and years ahead. So Jonathan, you have anything to add. Jonathan Zaffino : I think that's well said. I would add to that remember, if you look at our strong growth rates from quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year to Dom's point, this can create mix changes that are hard to read from any specific quarter and Dom mentioned our risk management business, which is an excellent business, which tends to run in that sort of mid-90s levels that was a bit of a - a bigger contribution this quarter. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, the earned premium from various new products, new underwriting divisions over the past few years are beginning to earn in and some of the dissipation if you will, of some areas that we had identified as a run off or those that we were deemphasizing our earning out, you're starting to see that intersection happen and we expect that to continue to happen in a beneficial way as we move forward here. So we're focused on delivering underwriting profit. We're going to be conservative in our views of how we recognize Dom's point, some of the rate changes that are earning through but I think those variety of factors are, what you're seeing is the reason for the mid-90s Mike Phillips : I guess more generally then there has been some concerns affecting the overall industry. And kind of rising toward activity and litigation activity and I guess anything you've seen there and if I - kind of your business and if so, anything that we would see from maybe the paid activity that we can look at it from your Loss Triangles? Jonathan Zaffino : No, - this is John again, we're obviously looking at the same dynamics that are being discussed across the industry. It's very difficult to broad-brush any one line of one area, each portfolio is a bit different, how companies address sort of where they hold certain acts - here it's a bit different. I would say as a general tone we are keeping a close eye on this it's often discussed in the general liability area. We write general liability for instance, across many different areas many different industry segments, each with different dynamics. And we talk about loss trend remember, there is two parts of that, there's frequency and severity, so they're going to differ from area to area. We're keeping an eye on it. We're encouraged by the rate levels that we're starting to see. Net trend is a little bit more muted with some of the exposure growth going on, but whether it's financial lines that's going to be a bit of a different mix, whether you're in Primary or Excess areas, same with the GL, autos has been talked about for quite some time. So overall, we take a look at the portfolio every quarter, really every day, trying to learn from what we're seeing out there, but I would say we feel pretty comfortable about where we are and even more comfortable as rate starts to build over the ensuing months here. Craig Howie : And fair to say we do not see an explosion in trend. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, what we see in our portfolio and differs by company but what we see in our portfolio is trend is well within our rate increases. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is going back to the margin conversation and really this is on the reinsurance side of things. So I know it's reflective of your business mix and Dom, I think you said we should look at the full year '18 and kind of compare the second quarter there, but I guess I'm thinking more about going forward, do you expect the mix to continue to tilt more toward casualty and away from property and should we think about the reinsurance At 86, attritional combined ratio is how we should think about modeling going forward or the half year. Just kind of margin expectations on a forward basis. Dom Addesso : Right, so the - for the first half it's 85.4 not 86, not to get too precise, but for on the attritional side. And look at in the reinsurance business it's difficult to predict where the mix will go because as we've talked about many times over many, many quarters, we'll put our capital to where we think the best opportunities are and what emerges next year is a better opportunity. Who knows, but I would say that where we are mix wise today is probably balanced, where we would expect to be over the remaining quarters. Certainly we would expect more writings in mortgage, which as you know carries a lower combined ratio I don't know that we necessarily see any explosion in casualty from here relative to our other lines of business. So I think the mix is kind of fairly stabilized in terms of where it is today and I will. I would like to emphasize. And I know this is in the point you were quite making here but certainly what we've seen in any of the write-ups the headline of margin deterioration and again, what I'd like to point out is with the growth in premium. It might be a deterioration in the ratio but the overall absolute dollars of underwriting margins have increased over time. And in combination with a lower in cat load frankly, that gives us, and also I think about the investment income flow without - over $800 million of positive cash flow in the first half of the year. All of those things are we think improving our profit target, overall profit target, so - and with the decreased level of volatility. I know that isn't quite more than perhaps you asked but I think where we are now. John Doucette : And Elyse, this is John, just to add a little more color. I mean, we're close to done within the treaty world of what we're going to put on the books for this year. They will still be facultative throughout the year. And there'll be the odd treaty deal. But obviously not that far along is January 1st and so we'll be watching closely obviously what happens in wind season as well as what we think the capital situation is the supply demand balance and that will dictate how much capital we deployed going forward and you know there continues to seem to be some dislocation and capacity shortages and trapped capital and related - related events As I talked about earlier. So we'll watch that and that will influence mix as well as we head into the New Year. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question on - if we look at your premiums writings on across the property lines. That was helpful disclosure that you guys added to the supplement, they've gone down and if we think about what happened. Obviously, now we had two successive years of high cat losses in your - John in your remarks, you mentioned some pretty good rate that you guys did see in Florida, but then we don't see that running through the premium written line. With that there were some accounts that were still under priced that you had to come off . Like how do we reconcile. I guess the fact that there were some pretty good rate in Florida and even in other areas of the world and your property rating - property writings, sorry, have come down? John Doucette : You're absolutely right, I mean we pushed rate and one of the ways that the market is going to get hard is - or okay - and less people willing to walk away from things and we pushed and we pushed and in some cases, we came off. We also did move up particularly in Florida, we moved up the tower, which again we thought that was a better place, better risk adjusted place to play and that that could be less, less premium, but it doesn't mean that it's less profitable risk adjusted profit. So we were pleased with how we reposition that book and then there certainly been up a couple of pro rata deals where we, we pushed for certain ceding commissions and the current summits and things like that and we didn't get there, but again we're bullish. We're not retreating from property at all. We thought after $200 billion, $250 billion losses maybe we had a view on what the right rate was to deploy capacity and something we talked about before is, we're also looking at is not in isolation of just property. We're also looking at it has the opportunity set for us to deploy capital whether that's into the casualty space where we see in an emerging situation, obviously the insurance, the facultative both casualty, and international property as well as the mortgage which we remain very bullish on. So we're also, we're looking at it beyond just a property comment. We're looking at it across the whole global portfolio. Dom Addesso : And as far as the shift that John was talking about. Generally, and this is mainly a Florida comment, the layers down low, lower traction limits we're frankly under-priced in our view and the increases there was nowhere near appropriate and also emphasize that we have increased some of our cat book outside the U.S., so John mentioned specifically Japan as one example. John Doucette : So particularly on the Florida part, Elyse, it's John, again And particularly on the Florida part where the view of the increased risk from some of the social inflation aspects we thought were more prevalent on the lower layers. Elyse Greenspan : And then lastly on the tax side, Craig. I think you said you know cats are lower, the tax rate should trend higher, I thought the expectation was for 13% for the year, it was a little bit light - lighter than that in the Q2 with low cats. Was there something impacting that in the current quarter? Craig Howie : Yes. In the current quarter, we actually had more income and more foreign source income that came through. So we were able to use more foreign tax credits against that income, Elyse. So that's the reason it dropped to 12% for the first half of the year. Operator : We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Josh Shanker : I guess, and this is for Jon Zaffino. You mentioned that your rate overall, your renewal rate pricing was up 2.9% and I think you said it was up 8.1% excluding workers' comp, workers' comp is about 20% of your portfolio. I'm trying to reconcile those numbers, did I understand you correctly? Jonathan Zaffino : Yes, it's a little more than that. Josh, it's work comps is probably closer to 30%. Josh Shanker : And then I guess, the number of assortment. So the, everything, example, workers' compensation of eight point - I mean, I know I did I just can't make the math work with numbers like that. Jonathan Zaffino : Well, here's what you have happening. Number one there is a lot of rate being had now in the property and auto lines. Some of our auto ratings are up year-over-year. We're seeing again increased rate in a number of other areas from financial lines to other liability. Comp, you're getting some exposure look at an increased rate then to what you are in other areas as well. So some of that shows up in renewal price change versus pure rate, so there's a number of - and then you get mix differences in the quarter as well, so the waitings could be a little different based on timing. So for instance, in the second quarter, we write a few large risk management deals you might see more of the impact on the work comp thing you might - it might mitigate some of the other areas and the opposite happens as well. So all those things kind of moving together. Josh Shanker : And you're still growing comp, I think comp probably is pretty healthy. But what is your flexibility if comp margins begin to change? How quickly can you move in and out of the comp markets? Jonathan Zaffino : Yes, it's a good question. I - look, I mean we see still a very favorable underlying dynamics and workers' compensation, we are watching more closely the of course the rate pressure in the impact that it has to overall profitability. Some of our growth and work comp has come from again some of the areas that we underwrite loss sensitive programs. So you're getting the benefit of the installation of deductibles in different areas. If we see work comp starting to get to the point where it's not meeting our profitability objectives we will turn the dial well, - we will move out of some of those, particularly some of those model line areas where we're constantly adjusting rates regularly across the various different statutory companies we have and so on and so forth. Comp is a smaller part of our book than it's been in a while. Some of that is the relative growth rates of other areas. So we will watch it closely. We feel comfortable with where it is today, but if the economic scenario dips. Further, we will selectively start to move out of different pockets but feel comfortable - these are the pockets will - where we will be able to maintain some insulation from underlying loss cost trend. Josh Shanker : And can you give any color on where margins are year-over-year in comp and accident year and calendar year basis, you going to give numbers like us - can we talk about - has there been a difference and where the initial marks are on comp business? Jonathan Zaffino : Fair to say that at this point comp is still very profitable, we don't, - we don't give specific my ratios disclose that anyway Craig that -- Craig Howie : We have not. We've said that it's run in the low '90s. In the past. Jonathan Zaffino : I think frankly that's where it's being booked but we think it's better than that. John Doucette : And just to echo Dom's comment earlier, we did take a little bit more of a conservative view of this year in the comp line in relation to some of the increased rate reductions that we were seeing, so feel pretty confident we're sort of in that range today. Operator : And now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : First question, in terms of the cat load coming down over time. Is there a dynamic of increasing reinsurance, retro purchase which is flowing through the financials and causing the underlying combined ratio did increase a little bit or is simply diversification and kind of shifting up the tower and whatnot? Craig Howie : Yes, Mr. Doucette to comment as well, but it's mostly about diversifying into other lines of business is growing those more quickly. In this particular six month period. Certainly, as Jon has pointed out we've come off a number of programs that didn't hit our pricing targets that had an impact. Jon made reference to the retro. We did purchase in his opening comments. In part that's part of our typical risk management of our book. We have in the past purchased ILWs and we have cat bonds and Mt. Logan so that's all has been part of the equation. And as you point out moving up the tower certainly decreases premium but gives us similar a better risk adjusted return and you want to add to Jon. Jonathan Zaffino : Just on the margin, the hedging, we have a very holistic broad brush hedging strategy and structure. And on the margin that can change the attritional combined ratio. But really, what's driving it is mix shift and growth in certain areas and growth in non-cat areas is driving it more than the hedging. Mike Zaremski : Next on the expense ratio just clarification, I think it was up 140 basis points year-over-year. I know, I think, Craig cited and multiples people cited, it's kind of moving into more casualty is so were there any one-time items there are kind of this is, was a clean quarter. When we think about it. Craig Howie : It's purely a mix shift and ceding commissions on pro rata casualty and product. Mike Zaremski : And lastly, any update, do you expect the Board to make a succession decision in near-term? Craig Howie : Yes. I and by the way, I appreciate everyone's restraints 4-5 callers to get to that question. But the simple answer to that is yes. And of course, I can't expand on that any further. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Amit Kumar from The Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Amit Kumar : Just a few quick follow-ups. The first question goes back to the growth in casualty reinsurance segment. I was just trying to better understand, if I look at casualty reinsurance pro rata. And I guess look at the definition in the K. Can you maybe you can just talk about some of the sub-segments. The growth is coming from, I guess I'm just trying to get some comfort that it's not skewed toward lines such as other liability et cetera. where there could be potential slippage in the tort climate? Dom Addesso : Jon, you have anything on that - The casualty in the reinsurance side, I will let John to comment I don't know if he has the specifics at hand this morning but clearly casualty includes work comp, includes professional lines, the liability businesses well, it's all included. I don't know if you have a mix handy. We don't have the specific number but up a 1,000 foot view, I would say that the heavier casualty is really about 20% of the portfolio. Recognizing at more we write this in kind of the U.S. in the London market et cetera. But then we also do write it all over the world. And then a lot of those other world of other areas. It's a, it's a lot more of the softer casualty as well and we are seeing opportunities there and we're seeing opportunities, as I have mentioned before in the back of which our book is 60% casualty and at 60% international. So also kind of diversifying away from that really heavier casualty book. But we do write a fair bit of comp in there. Embedded in some of the program, environmental and there is a pretty diversified portfolio that we have both in territory and sub lines. Amit Kumar : And maybe just related to that this might be for Dom or are you, do you have a view on the discussion on social inflation right now. Dom Addesso : Look as we recognize that and that we primarily see this, what we're seeing in the inflation area with the loss cost trends. Is mainly in coming from our insurance book reinsurance book given the varieties of treaties that we write. It's hard to call a trend because it can vary by the type of business that you are in the class of business the territory, et cetera. So we frankly rely on what we're seeing and the insurance side, at least in the early days. And clearly we see a loss cost trend. Hard to determine whether that's what you're calling social inflation or just traditional severity and frequency. Amit Kumar : Got it. Dom Addesso : I don't know, don't see any - necessarily any huge jury awards, if that's what you're getting at coming through our insurance book and or coming through our reinsurance side. Amit Kumar : Yes, that's what I... John Doucette : And this is John Doucette. I would just add that and also - within reinsurance. I mean, we have a lot more flexibility in terms of our ability to respond. So first of all, we have been writing long tail business since the '70s in all over the world and we have a lot of experience, a lot of experienced underwriters. A lot of people that understand the markets and we have a lot of data and we've seen, and we've seen things move. And we have seen - looking at inflation and social inflation and different loss cost trends and things like that. All over the world and we also have the ability to then move by product, by attachment point move in and out of classes that gives us a lot of comfort that we're able to, with our data our expertise, our underwriting capabilities to be able to recognize that and respond to it and we do that all over the world. And so we feel is something that we need to focus on and we do focus on, but we feel we have to keep the right capabilities to be able to respond appropriately and timely to it. Dom Addesso : So to sum that up. I would say that we don't necessarily see any \"shock to the system.\" coming from what everyone is identifying as loss cost trends. But it is something that we and the rest of the industry frankly are addressing and are dealing with and recognizing that it's a factor in reshaping portfolios, taking a look at rates et cetera. And I think everyone is being very deliberate about that. Amit Kumar : The only other question I had was on Mt. Logan. The AUN fell and there is obviously talk about in the past on regarding Stone Ridge's redemptions. How are you thinking about the future of this entity? John Doucette : Yes, this is John. So, it's what at - Mt. Logan is a core strategic vehicle for us as we - as we manage our catastrophe risks, but it's one of them and we look at, we have the cat bonds we buy traditional reinsurance, we buy traditional retro for Facultative for treaty. We now have the new aggregate retro. So it's - will turn dialed up and down. Based on that we have continue to add and look to add investors into the mix and normal course of business we will continue to do that, but we're not trying to grow for the sake of growing. It's one of the strategic dials it has very specific values to Everest, but, so do some of the other ones. And so we look across all of these as part of the holistic hedging strategy and structure that we have and you know we have the ability to turn up and down other deals as well. Amit Kumar : And what's the Investor percentage. If you could just remind me, that's the last question I have? The percentage. I think previously you've given that number. Thanks. John Doucette : I don't recall ever given that number. Amit Kumar : I think it was 85. I'll follow up offline. Thanks for the answers. And good luck for the future. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Go ahead. Ryan Tunis : I guess my first question is just on how - you said the PML exposures are down June 1st. Just curious if you could give us an order of magnitude around that? John Doucette : So I mean, it varies - we track 75 zones. It varies a lot by territory and by return period and based on what products that we offer and where the attachments are, you get very different answers to that along the way. Ryan Tunis : Is it - the property cat premium it showed down on a gross basis, is it fair to assume that on a net basis, it was down a similar amount or as a steeper decline? John Doucette : Can look at premium if you're trying to look across the premium, to determine of PML decrease? Ryan Tunis : No, I'm just curious in terms of - I can see the gross reduction in property cat premiums. I'm just trying to think about what profitability looks like in later cat type season. So I'm trying to get a figure, a sense of how much of that premium came down? John Doucette : I think we don't have that split out, but I think across the entire reinsurance. I mean, I think they are directionally moving about the same. Ryan Tunis : And then my last question is just on, I couldn't help but notice that there were no Kilimanjaro cat bond deals in the first half of the year and I. I think we've seen those in the past few. And I think that there is about $0.5 billion of limit maturing at year-end, I guess kind of same thing that Amit asked on Mt. Logan, how are you thinking about the affordability of those programs and in this environment. How are you thinking about those upcoming maturities? John Doucette : I think the answer is it's too soon to tell what we would want to do as we had to the exploration which happens in November in December and it will depend on pricing. It will depend on the wind season and things like that. And we do track the cat bond market and the pricing spreads widened for a while and then they came in a little bit. So it will be one and there'll be a lot of factors that we look at what is our gross book looks like, what are the alternative hedges look like. But right now we're not in a position to know whether what we would do for that or any of the other hedges. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open. Meyer Shields : And I appreciate your patience on this call. I don't know - I'm guessing just a quick question for Craig. I was hoping you could walk us through the earnings impact of the decline in Mt. Logan, assets under management? Craig Howie : So the earnings impact from the fee income that we receive that shows up in our books and records is relatively immaterial. And what I mean by that is for the quarter. It was down about $1 million overall for the year, we are up about $2 million. So relatively immaterial and that comes through other income, other expense. Meyer Shields : And then second, I guess, I'm trying to balance the year-to-date decline in interest rates with the growing presence of longer-tail lines of business in gross written premiums. Should we anticipate net written premium - I'm sorry. Net investment income going up or going down as we consider those factors? Craig Howie : Or into next year are you talking for the remainder of this year? Meyer Shields : I was thinking next year, but happy to hear how you're thinking about it. Craig Howie : Well, with strong cash flow, as I pointed out, when my previous answers - the first half of the year. Certainly increased asset base will be a bigger driver we think and kind of maybe what the Fed does, but we think then what interest rates do. So to that - to that degree than we would anticipate a growing investment income number. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Meredith : It's a couple of quick ones hopefully here. First one, Craig. What is new money yields look like right now versus kind of your book yield? Craig Howie : On an overall basis it's about 3.5%. Brian, but it really depends on what you're investing in, investment grade is probably slightly below that. But any bank loans or high-yield investments that we have alternative investments would be higher than that. Brian Meredith : Right. Obviously, yes. So, okay. So still pretty positive good. Craig Howie : Thanks. Brian Meredith : Second question - I'm just curious, it's thoughts on kind of the crop environment outlook here given kind of what's been going on with crops in the Midwest late planting and seeding et cetera? John Doucette : Yes, good morning Brian, it's John. So... Brian Meredith : Yes. John Doucette : So it was obviously a late start to the season, given the weather conditions and there was some prevented planting, and I know there's been some talk of that the prevented planting claims that you know they are - they are likely to some there, which will have - potentially have a - an upward pressure on the, loss ratio. But you know it's still early days that can recover. We don't know what's going to happen. It's both yield and revenue. And so the yield and recover, it's maybe a little bit more focused on or depending on what happens late in the year in terms of the temperatures on what's going to impact the harvest and in terms of what the crop prices are? We don't know, I mean that you know, if we knew that we are going to do a reinsurance as well. Brian Meredith : And then last one for you, John. Just curious, you made a comment that you thought that the I guess alternative capacity alternative capital, the reinsurance would continue to be somewhat constrained going into one more renewals, just curious why you think that is? John Doucette : So I think it's a combination of things. I think both some trapped capital that's still exists. And we think, well, but it's also I think the development that the markets on Irma, the development now that the markets on Jebi and I think - and then you have weather is a surprise or not maybe would depend on who is looking at it, but the situation with a couple of the alternative cat managers and how - what's happened to them, but so I think the sentiment among investors has been strained over the last couple of years. Having had five years of no-cat, basically, a very low cat, below average cats and then to have the two years with the losses. And then also have the development, I think has really focused a lot of the old alternative investors particularly ones that we call tourists that are really just they're just in it because it sounds different and interesting I think are really focusing on whether this is something they want to do. And I think all of that will map to a healthier reinsurance market and healthier retro market as the alternative investment manager is going to be held the higher standards on transparency, rate change, collateral lease and things like that. All that points to us to a healthier property market in 2020 at January one and beyond. Dom Addesso : Thanks everyone, for your dialogue this morning and patients and a little over, but that's fine. And I can't help but wanted to emphasize that the strategic journey that we've been on is proving successful. I just caution us all to sometimes not to focus one individual metric and for us I think the focus on the fact that our increased diversification has increased our absolute dollar margin - even though our combined ratios may increase due to a lower proportion of cap business but the advantage there's less volatility along, but along with an overall improved profit target and by the way I include investment income on that. We are a unique franchise, global franchise that is delivering returns at the highest levels of the industry right now. An exceedingly well positioned for the future. So again, thank you for your interest and look forward to your dialog and questions in the weeks ahead. Take care, have a good day. Craig Howie : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Thank you, Holly, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Dom Addesso, President and Chief Executive Officer; Juan Andrare, Chief Operating Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that our SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these SEC filings.  Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements.  With that, I turn the call over to Dom Addesso. Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Jon, and good morning, and welcome to our call. In the third quarter, Everest produced operating earnings of $3.39 per share despite experiencing $280 million of cat losses. Our underlying performance continued to be excellent as our attritional underwriting gain of $250 million nearly offset the catalysts. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting profit was $365 million and $700 million, excluding cats. This is a solid outcome and demonstrates our ability to absorb cat volatility due to a large and well-diversified book of business. When combined with another solid quarter of investment income, the year-to-date operating income is at $742 million. These outcomes are being driven by an organization that has evolved dramatically over the last several years due to an intentional strategic focus and supported by market conditions. What you see, for example, is a continued effort to reduce cat volatility as a result of growth, diversification and exposure reductions. In reinsurance, the growth has been focused largely on mortgage risk and casualty lines where rates, terms and conditions have been improving. Keep in mind that our cushion for these lines, especially casualty, was of a more recent vintage. For many years, we deemphasized casualty. Only recently, as the market has been improving, have we been growing premium. The greatest diversifier, however, has been our successful push into the specialty insurance space. By year-end, we will be closing in on $3 billion of annual gross premium. And as you have seen, the profit picture there remains solid.  Our timing on these initiatives has been good. Rates are improving in many sectors. And, yes, while there have been pockets of frequency and severity trends to take note of, these are managed through conservative loss picks through the cycle. We're in a long-term business, and at times, cost of goods sold may seem uncertain, but we are less worried about that and what we see on trend versus rate given our book of business and where we have it pegged. The market is poised to continue higher as it grapples with trend, increasing weather events and anemic investment returns on new money, but now is not the time to retreat.  With that, let me pass it over to my colleagues to give you some of the details around the story. First, to Juan Andrade, who, as you know, is my successor effective January 1. Juan? Juan Andrade : Thank you, Dom. It's a privilege to be here as a member of the Everest team. After 8 weeks on the job, I've had the opportunity to start getting deep into our businesses and to meet our employees, major customers and our key distribution partners in the U.S. and around the world. I'm very appreciative for Dom's support and that of the entire leadership team as we transition responsibilities at the end of the year. Dom has built a great business that we will continue to advance. Everest is well positioned for the current market environment. We have a highly diversified franchise with a strong team of smart and experienced leaders, a rock-solid balance sheet and enduring customer relationships. I have been very pleased with the talent, division, the energy, the focus and the pride in Everest that everyone I have met has shown. The feedback that I have received from our customers has been universally positive. They value the longevity of our trading relationships, our financial strength and sizable capacity, our knowledgeable underwriters and the access to products in the right locations, along with our responsiveness and innovation. We have 2 very strong and complementary businesses. We are a top 10 global reinsurer with a 47-year history. We have a seasoned and strong underwriting team around the globe, broad product capabilities, a dynamic strategy that is responsive to market conditions, best-in-class data-driven management systems and a competitive expense advantage. We also have an entrepreneurial and growing primary specialty insurance business with a client-first culture of providing solutions with more than 150 products and services. This team is led by highly skilled industry professionals who are focused on sustainable profitability and growth and who have the underwriting discipline and built the tools and processes required to ensure continued success. While being very cognizant to the challenges facing our industry, we also see opportunity. These industry challenges are resulting in improving pricing and terms and conditions in both insurance and reinsurance. In some classes of business, we are seeing the strongest rate movement in many years. This change in the market is long overdue, and we remain committed to being selective to where we dedicate resources and capacity. At Everest, we will continue to focus on underwriting profitability and sustainable growth with a relentless focus on execution, diversifying our business, always strengthening our enduring relationships, managing our cat exposure and maintaining our strong balance sheet that provides the foundation for the security that we provide to our customers. I am optimistic about the future of Everest. We have a strong franchise that is positioned to succeed regardless of market conditions.  With that, I turn the call over to Craig. Craig Howie : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $104 million. This compares to net income of $198 million for the third quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, Everest had net income of $792 million compared to net income of $474 million for the first 9 months of 2018. The 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 13%. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, our highest quarterly investment income in the last 9 years and lower catastrophe losses compared to the first 9 months of 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, the group incurred $280 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $230 million in the third quarter of 2018. The catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Dorian at $160 million and Typhoon Faxai at $120 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pretax estimated catastrophe losses of $335 million in 2019 compared to $795 million in 2018.  Everest reported $52 million of favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter. This primarily related to a onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that reduced prior year carried loss reserves by $44 million, which was offset by $44 million of commission paid, effectively no material impact to the underwriting result in the quarter. Another $4 million of the favorable development was identified through reserve studies completed in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe events and favorable prior year development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 87.7% through the first 9 months compared to 87.0% for the full year of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the reinsurance segment, which, as we have noted, has been writing more casualty business over the past several quarters. Turning to investments. Pretax investment income was $181 million for the quarter and $501 million year-to-date on our $20 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was up $60 million or 14% from 1 year ago. This result is primarily driven by the growth in investment assets coming from our record cash flow, which was $1.5 billion during the first 9 months. Some of the strong cash flow comes from the increase in overall premium volume, including an increase in the casualty writings, which has a longer tail and allows us to invest the money longer.  Before moving to taxes, I'd like to point out that we included, for the first time, on Page 15, in the financial supplement a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This shows an indication of the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $361 million allocated to reinsurance and $140 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. The split is based on gross carried loss reserves, excluding catastrophe reserves. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and illustrate the unrecognized embedded value of the growing insurance franchise. This is consistent with previous comments, encouraging investors to look at Everest on a sum-of-the-parts basis. On income taxes, the tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was the result of the amount and geography of the losses associated with the catastrophes and the favorable prior year reserve development associated with the onetime commutation of a multiyear contract that I previously mentioned. The year-to-date effective tax rate of 9% is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. Higher-than-expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend lower than the current 9%. Shareholders' equity for the group ended the quarter at $9 billion, up over $1 billion or 14% compared to year-end 2018. The increasing shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the $792 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio.  Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain strong. We maintain industry-low debt leverage, a high-quality investment portfolio and continue to generate positive cash flow. You will notice some minor revisions related to foreign exchange in our financial supplement. None of these revisions impact operating income. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide an review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. The magnitude of industry losses over the past 3 years has been extraordinary for the reinsurance market. Although the insurance industry would have hoped for a quieter 2019 to regroup, this has not been the case. The losses have shaken up the primary reinsurance and retro markets, creating dislocation and, in turn, opportunity. Though not an across-the-board traditional hard market, we see a foundationally more sustainable environment for the near and medium term in many lines. Multiple factors are pushing the market, including 2017, '18 and '19 cat losses, with corresponding trapped capital and negative sentiment for ILS; emerging industry loss trends in casualty; improving primary market and underwriting actions taken by major participants; and continued low investment income yields. Given the above, we are increasingly optimistic on the treaty and facultative global reinsurance market heading into renewal and our improving opportunity to deploy capital profitably in 2020 and beyond.  We continue to see increased demand for reinsurance globally driven by our clients' desire to reduce volatility, manage regulatory capital constraints and decrease net capacity deployed. That increase in demand, in conjunction with improved insurance and reinsurance pricing, terms and conditions, will result in more opportunities hitting our underwriting requirements and pricing targets. At the same time, the supply of reinsurance capital is relatively flat or down, considering trapped capital, given that over 50% of the retro capacity is supported by unrated, alternative capital. And there will be more collateral trapped by the recent events, in addition to the remaining collateral still trapped from the 2017 and '18 events. Not all rated reinsurers are positioned to write multiple classes of business across all territories to clients large and small, but we are. With our solid financial strength and ratings, multi-decades long trading relationships, we are one of the few global reinsurers writing in all P&C lines in most developed territories, making us well positioned to take advantage of these positive trends to drive differentiated results. Year-to-date reinsurance premium is $4.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Growth in our business is being driven by increased casualty writings, more proportional business, mortgage, more treaties with our global clients and increased back opportunities. This growth was muted by the reunderwriting of some portions of our property book as we pushed pricing and reduced lines or came off programs that did not meet our required pricing targets. Year-to-date, reinsurance underwriting profits are $310 million, impacted this quarter by the Dorian and Faxai losses mentioned by Craig.  Year-to-date reinsurance attritional losses are 57.5% compared to 57.0% for the full year 2018 due predominantly to shift in mix, increased casualty business as well as overall more proportional business to capture the primary rate movements. This is offset by increased mortgage writings which have a lower combined ratio. Heading into the renewal season, we are optimistic about the market conditions in casualty, fac, mortgage and certain property markets, including retro and loss-affected areas.  In U.S. casualty, reinsurance terms are improving. Primary rates are increasing on loss-affected programs, along with some tightening of terms and conditions. Some market participants have signaled reducing capacity. Combined, this results in some interesting opportunities. Since 2018, we have been increasing our casualty reinsurance writings based on these improving conditions, and this trend will likely continue heading into January 1 renewals. Facultative is seeing meaningful, increased submission activity globally, improved rates and terms in both property and casualty, resulting in an increased business at much improved economics. As mentioned last quarter, our global fac book is well over $400 million gross written premium in force, and we see continued growth opportunities there given favorable market conditions. Fac is typically a leading indicator of client risk appetite, and therefore, shows increased future demand for our treaty capacity.  The global impact of Lloyd's and other major insurers reunderwriting is meaningful. Significant premium is coming to market, which is then subject to increased rate and improved terms and conditions. This is in addition to some large primary insurers tightening capacity and pushing rate in both property and casualty lines. The mortgage market remains favorable as the large GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, continue to privatize risk. Our well-seasoned mortgage portfolio continues to produce strong earnings with growth potential. Currently, our annualized mortgage book is about $200 million of gross written premium, including many multiyear deals with future premium that has not yet been recognized. We continue to proactively scrutinize relevant economic trends and underwriting standards which remain attractive, and we'll continue to look for more opportunities there. Given these multiple areas to deploy profitably our capital, our pricing targets for cat-exposed property reinsurance and retro continue to rise. We remain committed to manage volatility to our long-standing disciplined underwriting, robust portfolio construction and through increased property hedging in both traditional and alternative hedges. The current property momentum is generally favorable and likely will last well into 2020, but additional improvement in rates, terms and conditions are required in global property reinsurance and retro markets given the elevated risk factors and increased exposures in certain territories as well as the recent substantial industry losses. More rate is required to get back to adequate levels to achieve a long-term, appropriate and sustainable return on capital. Concentrating property underwriting on our core clients has created a better risk-adjusted portfolio with significantly more dollars of profit per unit of risk, and we do have the capacity to increase our participation in improving markets when returns increase enough to warrant. We expect January 1 property rates to generally be up in most regions, and more recently loss-affected territories will see greater impacts. In retro, we anticipate double-digit rate increases. With Hagibis causing further losses and trapped capital late in the year and uncertainty of ultimate loss, rates may improve more. Improvement in retro is necessary given those rates have been under the most pressure by nontraditional capital but also because retro bore a disproportionate share of losses since 2017. Everest has the capital and capability to effectively write in this market. We believe there will be select opportunities to deploy additional capital depending on market conditions. Overall, we are in a reinsurance market where favorable trends exist for those able to capture and maximize the best opportunities. With our financial strength, nimble culture, global capabilities and diversified capital sources, we are prepared to meet our clients' needs while delivering superior results to our shareholders. Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thanks, Jon. Good morning. Everest Insurance has just completed another quarter of solid execution, resulting in excellent top line growth, and more importantly, continued profitability. We continue to advance our strategy to build a world-class, diversified Specialty Insurance Group fueled by talent, partnerships and a deep set of specialty products that are well positioned within this changing market. Our solid results this quarter billed on the first 2 quarters of this year and marked the 19th consecutive quarter of growth for the insurance operations. Our gross written premium growth of 29% quarter-over-quarter is once again balanced across all major business segments. Our growth accelerated this quarter beyond our year-to-date trend line of plus 21%, in part, reflecting the changing nature of the market which is impacting nearly all major product lines. This is particularly the case for business originated within the excess and surplus line market, which accounted for over 1/3 of our premium written in the quarter.  Our new business this quarter provides some additional context on our balanced growth. It was driven by a multitude of areas, reflecting the specialty nature of our portfolio, including specialty casualty, which, once again, experienced meaningful rate increases in the quarter; our property and short-tail businesses, led by both our retail and excess and surplus property divisions, both of which also achieved meaningful rate increases; and our various other specialty product lines, including transactional risk, credit and political risk and surety. Each of these businesses continues to see meaningful increases in opportunity. The segments I just referenced make up approximately 75% of our business growth in the quarter and represent the balanced portfolio we seek to build. The combined ratio for the quarter is 96.4%, 3.2 points better than the third quarter of 2018 and year-to-date is 96% or 2.1 points better year-over-year. This is due to both lower catastrophe losses impacting our repositioned property portfolios and to an improved attritional loss ratio. The expense ratio remained stable despite our continued commitment toward investments in people, technology, new business units and new facilities. New underwriting capabilities established in Bermuda and the regulatory approval of the London branch of our Irish insurance company are good examples of these new facilities and represent our continued commitment to international expansion. Further, new and expanded office locations in the U.S. are bringing us closer to the customers and trading partners we serve. Turning to the rate environment. We are encouraged by the results we see here. In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which exclude the impact of exposure of 7.6%, excluding workers' compensation, and a positive 6.7% year-to-date. The quarterly ex work comp rate increase is the largest increase seen since the second quarter of 2012 and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property and commercial auto portfolios.  Financial line in umbrella, excess are also showing improvement in the mid- to high-single digits, while general liability rate lift continues to build momentum with rate increases in the mid-single-digit range. The London wholesale market is also improving, showing double-digit improvement this quarter driven by professional indemnity, management liability and property. Year-to-date, International is showing a 7% improvement.  We are very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment. In terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer compelling solutions to the market. This, coupled with strong retention rates within both our wholesale and retail books, is an encouraging sign. In other words, the strategic plan we have been executing over the last several years has positioned us well in this current rate environment.  Most importantly, this growth in top line, coupled with improved business metrics, has resulted in Everest Insurance continuing to post an underwriting profit over 2x greater for the year-to-date period and now standing at 10 of the past 11 quarters. As Craig mentioned in the new investment disclosure, the pretax net investment income for insurance is $140 million year-to-date, thus our pretax operating income year-to-date now stands at $195 million, an excellent result. In conclusion, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making and the establishment of a world-class specialty insurer. The over 90,000 new business submissions we have received year-to-date in our direct broker operations speak to our relevance and positioning in this market. Further, the underlying performance of our diverse books of business remain solid, and hence, we are well positioned to create value for all of our constituents in the evolving market ahead.  We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Holly for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group. Amit Kumar : And welcome to Juan on the conference call. One question and one follow-up. Maybe I'll start with Juan. With you coming onboard, and I know you mentioned that you've been meeting people, et cetera, over the past 2 months. Do you have a view on Everest Re's reserves? And will you be doing some sort of a ground-up reserve review as we head into year-end? Juan Andrade : Thanks, Amit, and thank you for the welcome on that. And, look, as you pointed out, I've had the opportunity to actually travel quite extensively over the past 2 months, meeting people, reviewing our businesses, et cetera. With the point specifically on reserves, I have had a number of discussions with our actuarial team, and what I can tell you is that Everest has a very solid process. Expected loss ratios are reflective of our best current information, industry data and other data sources. We also have very experienced underwriters who know their business, and they proactively work to mitigate known potential and unknown exposures, and the company also reacts to bad news quicker than good news. So we're constantly analyzing, taking actions on these findings and constantly repeating this process to ensure the strength of our balance sheet. Frankly, this process has resulted in Everest initial loss ratio picks developing, on average, over the last -- over 2 points favorable, including cats, over the past 10 years. And again, I think that's an important point that we have seen favorable development, on average, of 2 points over the last 10 years from our initial loss ratio picks. So I believe that we have a solid process, and we're constantly reviewing this performance of our business, and we will take action if it's warranted. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's helpful. And the only follow-up, and I will re-queue. This might be for Dom or Mr. Zaffino. Going back to the growth in the Insurance segment, I think 21%. I know we discussed this on the last call. However, in some of the recent conference calls, there have been further alarm bells on the loss cost trends, the discussion on social inflation, the total environment, even the underlying loss cost trends. Does this give you a reason to maybe slow down the growth from here? Or how are you thinking about the rate versus your loss cost trend metric? Dominic Addesso : Let me start, and I'll ask Jon to jump in as well. As we previously mentioned in the opening comments, any new business opportunities that we take on appropriately contemplate trend, frequency and severity, et cetera. And obviously, we've been getting rate increase for the last couple of years in many of the lines. I'd also point out that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our loss picks that we put on these books of business are very conservative from the very beginning and reflect those trends that we're all concerned about. In fact, relative to the market, I'll point out that, take commercial auto for example, we've been increasing our loss pick there for the last couple of years in recognition of those trends. Similarly on excess liability, the same thing, although we're not necessarily seeing any spike in claims activity. But in anticipation of some of the noise within the marketplace, again, we're picking a conservative number. Likewise on workers' compensation where we've seen rate decreases, we've also been increasing our loss selection there. Although that line of business continues to trend very favorably from a loss reserve perspective. So we certainly share the market's concerns over these issues. But as I've mentioned earlier, we think we have them properly ring-fenced. And we'll see what the future will tell for that. And, Jon, do you have anything to potentially add to that? Jonathan Zaffino : Yes. Let me touch on the growth for a second in the quarter here, and there's really 5 or 6 things we're seeing as contributory to the growth. First and foremost, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's all increased rate opportunity that we're seeing across the board almost, excluding workers' compensation, combined with pretty solid renewal retention. So if you recall from prior quarters, there was a lot of portfolio reshaping, repositioning going on. We've seen that stabilize, so our retention ratios are much stronger than they have been. Secondly, as I mentioned, we're seeing a lot of opportunity in the E&S space. Submission flows are through the roof. We're seeing a lot more opportunity there, a lot of dislocation, and it's predicated off of a number of different factors, but we're certainly taking advantage of that. And then somewhat linked to that is the growth in our underwriting population. Over the last year, we sort of stopped the clock at third quarter of '18 to say we've increased the underwriting population by almost 20%. So we have more people, wonderful talent across the board who's able to respond to this market change and condition, and we're taking advantage of that. The other piece I'll point out is even as you look at the supplement, even in our -- some of our specialty casualty areas -- remember, very little of what we do is standard business. This is a specialty company. So while it might be in a certain line like GL, we will write GL out of 12, 13 different areas, each with various tones of specialization. And as Dom mentioned, we're going to react to trends as we see them. We're constantly monitoring for those and react accordingly. So you almost have to deconstruct those buckets to really get the -- to feel what's happening underneath there, but we're comfortable where we're at. Operator : We will now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question. Was hoping, Juan, to get some color from you just in terms of thinking about Everest's outbound retro strategy for next year, if you have a view in terms of using cat bonds, ILWs or traditional retro within the outbound purchases. And I guess, just on an overall basis, you guys alluded to retro rates increasing substantially at 1/1, and so retro rates really do skyrocket next year. Would you have to shrink your kind of curve capacity if you aren't able to buy that coverage? Juan Andrade : Sure, Elyse. So let me start, and I'll ask John Doucette to add some color to that. Look, I think as John Doucette mentioned in his remarks, we are seeing a change in the retro market. There's a lot of trapped capital currently out there, particularly from the events in '17, '18 and '19. And as a Jon mentioned, the majority of that retro really has been without alternative capital. As far as rated carriers are concerned, this does create an opportunity for us to get additional rate that is much needed in that space and for us to have essentially opportunities for growth there, albeit on a disciplined way of doing that. So we are looking at opportunities for growth in that space right now, and I think John can give you a little bit more color on our strategy. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. So part of the rationale as to how we built the strategy of how we think of hedging the book is we want to get it to the right net risk appetite and then also shape the book to where we want, more here or less there, in terms of net position. But very importantly is we have -- and we've talked about this a lot. We have a variety of hedges, different products, different durations, different attachment points, different territories, frankly, different investor pools of capital that we're -- that we've been tapping into. And that's the cap on capital pool is different than the Logan investor pool is different than our traditional reinsurance and retro hedges that we put in place, different than ILWs. And what we have built is a suite of those that are a lot more robust than any one of them individually. And I would note that, particularly with the cat bonds, and this was intentional, the cat bonds that we do are on a multiyear basis. And we are one of the largest, if not the largest, sponsor of the catastrophe bonds in the world on the property side. And those basically, year-over-year, will have no increase in the cost of hedging. And so that provides a nice, stable anchor to our hedging strategy, and then -- and again, we'll look at all -- across the whole suite of the different hedges that we have. We'll look at that in terms of how -- what we want to do where and based on availability and price and execution and things like that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question. If we could -- do you guys have an initial view on the Q4 cat losses for Everest? We obviously had another typhoon in Japan. You also have the California fires and some events within Texas. And, Craig, in terms of taking to the Q4 tax, can you just kind of guide us in terms of tax rate for the fourth quarter as well? Dominic Addesso : Let me start, and I'll then ask Craig to mention the tax rate. It's really early days on assessing Hagibis. You've seen, I'm sure, what the modeling firms have put out in one particular case. The range is pretty wide, and it's really too soon for us to direct the market on where that loss is ending up. We obviously have other events, Faxai, that can be used somewhat as a guidepost. But even in that particular case, it is still very early in assessing where that might end up. Although, obviously, we feel we've reserved it conservatively at the high end of the range. So we can't give any guidance at this point until we know more. And the minute we know more, I'll come up with an estimate. We certainly will be potentially disclosing that. And, Craig, why don't you... Craig Howie : Elyse, this is Craig. With respect to taxes, I mentioned in my comments one of the things that we look at from an effective tax rate standpoint is the number that we gave for this quarter is an annualized number. It's essentially a 9% rate. If the catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter are higher than our planned catastrophe estimates for the fourth quarter, we would expect that rate to be lower than the 9% rate. As far as what's in the plan for the fourth quarter, we've given you guidance before that our average annual cat load is just under 7 points of cat and about 1/4 of that would be in our planned cat load for the fourth quarter. Dominic Addesso : Keep in mind that -- I know you're trying to get to a specific number on the P&L. But in fact, to the whole notion of how we manage cat exposure, we do manage cat exposure on an after-tax basis. Clearly, some markets don't have the ability to do that because they're in a tax-free jurisdiction, but we look at our net cat exposure on an after-tax basis. So we think we have a unique ability to take on business in a tax-efficient manner. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. John, I'm just curious your commentary about more renewals and solid pricing and what's happening here. If you break that down, what are you looking at as far as Europe goes? Because Europe, I don't think it's had quite the cat activity. And could that potentially offset some of the -- kind of good pricing we're seeing in retro when we look at the total picture? John Doucette : Yes. Brian, it's John. Yes. I mean, look, we write $6 billion to $7 billion premium all over the world, all products, all lines and across large clients, small clients. There's going to be pockets that we think are doing better. We'll try to allocate more pockets that aren't necessarily doing as well. There'll be less. And to your point, so we went to -- this is the conference season. So several of us went to Monte Carlo, and there was a lot of bullish talk on pricing there. Then we -- some of us went to CIAB out in Colorado, and it was more bullish there. Part of that is the timing. Part of that is the territory. And then a lot of our underwriters just recently came from APCIA, and we're more bullish still. So we're seeing -- generally, I think we're feeling like there's some momentum building on the pricing, but there are definitely pockets of that, that, that wouldn't apply too as much. And in bottom, the conversation was more muted, partially because of the loss activity over the last few years. And right now, going on now is the Asian conference, SIRC. So we're looking to get feedback there. But part of -- as we really think about this global portfolio and how we dynamically allocate it, we'll do that in real time based on where we see the opportunity set for us best to deploy our capital. Brian Meredith : Great. And then just quickly on the Insurance side, I'm just curious. Big growth in your property short-tail this quarter after it being kind of down for the last several quarters. What kind of happened all of a sudden caused a big shift there? Jonathan Zaffino : I don't know if it was a big shift as it might look. There are obviously improved market conditions that we're seeing. Some of it has to do with lower year-over-year comps on some deliberate actions we took in the prior year in the portfolio. But overall, we're feeling quite optimistic about the opportunities that are coming in. Obviously, we measure those on a real-time attribution basis, and we can see sort of what's happening. And we're very confident that the book that we're assembling right now is quite strong. So some of it's year-over-year comps, but it was just simply a function of market opportunity and rate. Brian Meredith : Great, great. And just one other quick one on the Insurance side. Special liability, are you guys seeing the same type of loss trend pressure that others have kind of talked about and reported? Jonathan Zaffino : We're seeing it as an industry observation, but not as much in our book. If you recall 3 years ago, we took very aggressive corrective action and basically took most of our exposure off, particularly in the public D&O space. So we are watching the same types of events, and we are seeing those. But our book is a bit different, a bit insulated. What we're encouraged by, Brian, is the rate we're seeing. So if we look at it quarter-over-quarter on our professional liability book or our D&O book, it's -- the rates have almost doubled. So we're more constructive on that market going forward, so starting to build some exposure, but we've been a little bit insulated by some of those broader trends. Dominic Addesso : And that is another series of lines of businesses where we took -- made some loss pick selections higher a couple of years ago. So we have been aggressive in pushing up our loss picks in those lines as well. I mentioned earlier the casualty, in particular, and commercial auto but also on the professional areas, we've been pushing up our loss cost -- pushing up our loss picks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : First question is around losses from Dorian and Faxai. I guess there are many ways to slice and dice this, but one thing I did note was that the market share -- Everest market share of these losses seem to be pretty much in line with the market share of prior losses in these regions for the company. And I would have just thought that maybe that market share should compress, just given the actions that you've taken to shrink your catastrophe exposures. So any thoughts on that? John Doucette : Yaron, it's John. Overall, we did -- as we reprice the book, we did take -- decreased some net exposure, as you saw in our PML that we stated. And part of it is a function of what we were trying to get to in some of the more of the peak zones, and part of it is a function of where we see the opportunity set. So we have been a very strong supporter, for example, in the Caribbean for a long time. We have developed a very nice attractive book there. And correspondingly, we have a decent market share there. And our intention always is try to have a lower market share of the loss, the market share of the premium as we try to build out the portfolio. But part of it is where the specifics of the losses that happen. Dominic Addesso : So you would have seen -- I think another way to answer that question is that, as we were trying to reduce some volatility, as John mentioned, looking at our PML disclosures, certainly a big part of the reduction would have occurred in Florida specifically. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question just goes back to the Bermuda reinsurance segment where we saw a significant decrease in the commissions and brokerage ratio. Can you maybe talk about that? Dominic Addesso : Craig, can you... Craig Howie : Yaron, this is Craig. One of the things that I would encourage you to take a look at with respect to that Bermuda book and the commission lines, specifically, is look at it more on a year-to-date basis. What is included in that line is also contingent commissions, but what you're really seeing is a change in business mix. What we've seen is lower costs on the commissions paid for some of the property pro rata business and some larger global account deals that have been written as well as mortgage. Offsetting this slightly is what you're seeing is a higher loss pick, which is up about one point year-over-year. So again, the idea was to grow the book but to get it -- to grow the book at a better overall margin. Yaron Kinar : Okay. So I guess we should look at the year-to-date results as maybe a better indicator of the actual run rate? Craig Howie : Yes. So that's down about 3 points, but that's more in line with where we would expect it to be than the quarter number, yes. Dominic Addesso : And keep in mind, that highlights the fact that -- we've been saying about improving rates, terms and conditions on the reinsurance portfolio. That evidence fell through in the proportion of business through lower, lower cedes. So that's where we're seeing the benefit of that. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Crystal Lu : This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. My first question is about the reserve development this quarter. Can you provide some detail on where the reserve releases came from? Craig Howie : Sure, Crystal. This is Craig. What I would say to you with respect to the reserve studies that were completed this quarter, essentially what we saw were releases from Canada as well as accident and health on the reinsurance side. Dominic Addesso : In addition to the mortgage. Craig Howie : In addition to the -- yes. In addition to what we had said with respect to the commutation of the multiyear deal. But the actual reserve studies that were completed for the quarter were favorable by about $4 million. Crystal Lu : Okay. That's helpful. And the second question is on capital management. Can you just talk a little bit about your desire to build capital versus return it going forward? Dominic Addesso : Well, first of all, our strategy around capital has always been to certainly maintain some level of excess capital in order to support the growth that we've had, and you've seen how we've been able to grow the business organically over the last couple of years. So we clearly feel that we do have sufficient capital, and we also feel we have some excess capital. But we have not been, in essence, returning -- buying in any shares over the last several months. As you know, our stated intentions have always been to not be aggressive in terms of buying in shares during catastrophe season. So it doesn't diminish our appetite for share repurchases going forward or in any other forms of returning capital to shareholders once we emerge out of the cat season. Operator : We will now take our next question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer Shields : Great. This is, I think, mostly for John Doucette. I'm trying to balance the benefit of accelerating and increasingly earned rate increases against the book of business diversification into higher loss ratio lines. So basically, can you give us a sense as to when the benefits of rate will match or outpace the higher attritional combined associated with more casualty? John Doucette : That's a multi-faceted question. There's not a simple answer for that. We do look at -- maybe I'll bring it back to kind of our pricing and ROE framework. So we do have a holistic ROE framework that goes across all lines of business, all territories, and that factors in volatility of the lines, historical performance of the lines. It also factors in duration. So we can kind of crystallize things into one view of risk and return based on an ROE framework that we have, and we would see -- and so that would factor in long duration versus short duration, volatile versus nonvolatile and things like that, that allows us to help turn the dials. And again, that will vary all over the place by territory, by line, by client, by size, by product, et cetera. Dominic Addesso : Keep in mind, too, Meyer, the other thing that I think was worth considering or looking at and things -- something we've referenced in the past is that you've got to be careful about just looking at the combined ratio. And sometimes, you got to pay attention to the dollars, to the bucks. And the reality is, is that when you look at our underwriting result in dollar terms, it's actually gone up year-over-year. So I understand we look at the combined ratios themselves, but we also look at dollars of profit. Meyer Shields : No. That's very fair. Just a quick follow-up. The Faxai estimate that you guys put out was clearly very conservative. But I'm wondering, now that we've had another typhoon in sort of the same region and the risk of some demand surge associated with that, is there still a risk of, I guess, either industry-wide or Everest's Faxai losses going up? Dominic Addesso : Oh, I don't know how you answer that, Meyer. You could always say there's a risk to anything, and perhaps there's a risk that it could go down, too. I mean maybe that's the right way to answer it. But we've reserved it what we think is a very conservative level. I think it's been suggested that the industry ranges reflect the risks that you are referencing. So therefore, perhaps it's already embedded in the industry estimates. Look, more than that, we're not certain, but we don't have strong conviction that we're going to be short. Put it that way, best way I could say it. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : Dom, first off, congrats on a successful career at Everest, and all the best to you. My first question -- as I've taken everything's been said on the call so far, it feels like if we think about on the casualty side that you're saying the trend is well within rate increases. And then also, I think, Dom, you mentioned you guys have been underweight in some of the lines that might be causing some higher trend for -- more so for your peers. I'm just kind of curious. Is there a fear factor in the broader marketplace right now in the casualty side causing rates to move so much? Or is it truly a change in loss trend coming into the marketplace or both? Dominic Addesso : I think it's -- it could be a number of factors, and I'll ask certainly any of my colleagues here to chime in as well. I do think that the marketplace is seeing trend, clearly, which, again, we feel that we've either accommodated through rate increase and/or a higher loss pick. And just to stay on that point for just a second, I think you'll find that if you examine our lines of businesses that we are near the high end, if not at the high end, or even above many industry loss estimates for the industry loss picks. So we have reserved it conservatively. And clearly, with our mid-90s combined ratio and you back off a very competitive expense ratio of lower than average expense ratio, you back into a loss ratio that I think you'll find is, again, above the industry. And that's not because of our book of businesses. It's because we conservatively selected a loss space. So just to focus on that for just a second. But I do think, back to your question, factoring will be trend. The factor will be perhaps some of the industry maintaining their loss picks through a softening cycle and perhaps they're seeing some of the redundancy, if have had redundancies, start to erode. That's a factor as well. Certainly, anemic investment returns, meaning an increasing desire or need to have an increasing underwriting return. Those are all factors that impact any underwriter's view or any management's or executives' view of where the market needs to go. John Doucette : Yes. And, Mike, this is John Doucette, and I just want to add a little more color from the reinsurance side. So, yes, we have been underweight over the last several years, and I encourage you all to go back and look at what we've been saying about casualty going back 6 or 7 -- starting 6 or 7 years ago, where we talked about concern of worsening casualty markets, broadening terms and conditions and some emerging risks. And clearly, increased ceding commissions on the reinsurance side. A lot of that is now coming to fruition. So it's exactly what we have been talking about in reunderwriting and managing our portfolio for a long time, which we think puts us in a good stead going forward to take advantage. We are seeing some of the larger buyers come back into the market, and that can have a meaningful impact on the reinsurance market. So a lot of those losses also had stayed with some of the large globals who have been buying less. And I think the pendulum swinging back now as they're looking to help decrease their net lines as well as the underwriting results that they're doing on a gross basis. So we think that will certainly impact the market. So a combination of what we had done starting 6 or 7 years ago as well as the opportunity set that we have with our ratings and balance sheet and positioning with the large global clients who have very, very tight reinsurance security list and a whole lot of reinsurers either don't qualify or aren't allocated large lines to them, we think puts us in a good stead for what we see as an improving casualty market going forward. Michael Zaremski : That's helpful points. And finally -- yes, please. Jonathan Zaffino : No. I was just going to add one quick point from insurance side. And just to be clear, I don't think we dispute the fact that there is trend. There is trend. I think what Dom is referencing is we've made conservative loss selection, but I'll give you a for instance here on our commercial auto book. On the insurance side, I just want to remind you, it's less than 10% of our total premium. So it's not a big part of what we do. Our accident years '13 through '16, we took corrective measures all throughout the reserving processes, and so we did see the average development. The reality is we have already taken the measures to address that. So just a quick point. We're not disputing the fact that there is trend. It's real, but I think some of the measures we've taken are giving impact. Dominic Addesso : Thanks, Mike. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. And lastly just maybe for John Doucette. You spoke about property reinsurance and about there being elevated risks and more rate needed to reach \"adequate levels.\" So I guess do you feel that in the segment of the crop cat market that maybe isn't earning its cost of capital today, and so we need to see double-digit plus rate increases to kind of get more bullish on you guys growing that portfolio meaningfully? John Doucette : Yes. There's a lot of moving parts there. And so a lot of it is a function of what, where the losses have happened and frankly what the response for the market and what the response of some of our clients is to losses. And $250 billion, $350 billion of losses we sometimes have a disagreement with some of our clients in terms of what the right price equilibrium should be after the losses have happened. And you look at different brokers put out different rating indices. And while we have seen some rate, that's kind of coming back. That's building back up to some of the rate decreases that have been happening since in 2011, 2012, and we watch that carefully. So we are looking. It will vary -- certainly, there's been underwriting issues that we've been focused on in terms of reunderwriting and managing our wildfire exposure and things like that, that we had focused on.  So there's a variety of conditions that -- where we're going to get to. But we're going to deploy capacity where we think we're getting paid the best. We're going to deploy capacity behind long-term strategic clients, and that will vary by product, and then we'll allocate. And this is important that I don't think people realize as much. We also move between excess loss -- cat ex loss versus proportional versus per risk, and we'll move that within the same client to get -- and we'll also move within cat layers. We'll move up and down layers based on where we think we have the best rates, and that's very helpful. And because of our trading relationships and our balance sheet, we have more ability to do that than some of our competitors. And then we'll also look at allocating between our reinsurance and retro based on where we see the best pricing conditions. So there's a lot of moving parts going into that for where and how we're going to deploy our capacity. Operator : We will now take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : And, Dom, congratulations on a decade. Hopefully, you won't be a stranger. And congratulations to Juan on your start at Everest. Wish you the best. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Josh. Joshua Shanker : Yes. First question, I guess for John Doucette. And if we look over a multiyear attritional combined ratio like underlying in the reinsurance space, it's been going up. As you've been deemphasizing catastrophe -- or not deemphasizing, but writing non-cat and casualty as a higher proportion of the book, as we think about 2020 and the mix of the book, should we continue to see the attritional combined ratio rising in the reinsurance segment based on mix? John Doucette : Josh, I think I would say the year-to-date numbers today for the attritional loss are probably a decent indicator for what 2020 is going to look like. Dominic Addesso : And again, back to -- let me -- Josh, let me just jump in. By the way, thank you for your thoughts. Let me just jump in here. Again, back to my comment I made earlier about let's not get too focused on the \"combined ratio\". The only way you'd see the combined ratio go up on an attritional basis is if the dollars of profit margin would be going up. So that's the way we would look at it. Joshua Shanker : Okay. But of course, I mean, the cat business has a very low attritional combined ratio to it and so lower proportion of the overall pie, I guess. Dominic Addesso : I take your point on that, and I don't think you'd necessarily see that book of business shrink so dramatically that it would have a meaningful impact on that element of the combined ratio that you're referencing. Joshua Shanker : All right. And then for Jon Zaffino, on the insurance and winning business, we are seeing with some of the companies that have already reported a decline in retention on their insurance businesses. Could you just talk a little bit about the relationship with distributors and what they're seeing in terms of how competitive you need to be with the brokers in order to win new business? Jonathan Zaffino : Josh, I guess I would maybe reframe the question a little bit and just start by offer a comment on what defines a relevance to our brokers. Number one, and we talked about this in the past, while we've been active at transforming and building the insurance operations over the last 5 years, recall that all of our main divisional \"client-facing leaders\" are far from new to this business, averaging over 30 years' experience. They have deep and long relationships with many of our distribution sources. So number one, we have a number of connection points within both the retail, wholesale, even delegated authority pockets of the market. Secondly, I think one of the keys themes for relevance is can you bring forth a very strong, differentiated balance sheet across a wide range of products. That's why we constantly sort of quote the 150 specialty products. And we're finding that happen in lots of different pockets. We're seeing the relevance of that in a lot of different pockets. For instance, some of our rating-sensitive lines of business, D&O, credit, political risk, surety, our balance sheet differentiates So we're seeing a good flow of opportunity there. In a market like this, the key is to be able to respond to the flow that you're receiving. So a lot of the work we're doing -- and we constantly talk again about investments in technology. How do we handle all this throughput? Again, I mentioned, I think, the 90,000 submissions new business year-to-date. How do you handle that? A lot of work we're doing operationally to make sure we're prepared. So when you think of those things together, the relationships we have, the wonderful balance sheet, the deep set of products and the improvement operational environment to handle all this, it creates a pretty powerful formula. Did that get to it, Josh? Joshua Shanker : I suppose. And do you think that some of your competitors are getting less relevant as your abilities become more relevant in the market? Jonathan Zaffino : Well, I think one thing we are seeing is a change underwriting posture from a lot of our competitors. And you heard about limit compressions in a bunch of different markets which is opening up opportunity for us. We've been pretty much front foot from the beginning. We know what we want to do to. It's an organic build. We're not distracted by rapid changes in underwriting appetite. So we are picking up some of the advantage of a market that is viewed, I think, generally as quite skilled in what we do, very stable and very clear on what our asset types are. So that's been benefiting us. Operator : As there are no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Dominic Addesso : Yes. Thank you, Holly, and let me just close this out. I'd like to thank you all for joining this morning. And of course, thanks for the many years of relationships we've developed. As you know, this is my last earnings call, and you can well imagine the smile on my face. Not that I don't love you all, just saying. Actually, through that time, I've appreciated the exchange. It's not easy to summarize these last 10 years, but let me leave you with a few quick thoughts. As I've said many times, this is a long-term business. It needs to be managed in that fashion. And while, at times, conflicts with your mandate, which I understand, one shouldn't lose sight of the game plan. To that end, Everest has been on a path to grow shareholder value. And over a 10-year period, we had a compound annual growth rate of close to 10% in that shareholder value growth. And gross written premium has grown from $4 billion in 2009 to what would be hopefully an annualized $9 billion in 2019.  At the same time, we reengineered our legacy Insurance business and bolstered those reserves and went on to build what is becoming one of the best premier specialty insurance franchises in the business, approaching $3 billion in gross premium written. Our reinsurance business has evolved into a more diversified portfolio, growing profitably into what is now one of the top markets for brokers globally, a true international brand. Investment portfolio has been greatly diversified and by several metrics has proven to be one of the best performing relative to duration, quality and data. None of this happens without the great team sitting with me here today, and I thank them enormously for their support and efforts. And now we ask Juan to lead us on that journey. I'm extremely confident that he and Messrs. Doucette and Zaffino, along with the rest of the Everest team, will continue to do great things.  Thanks for this morning, and hopefully, we'll see you in the days ahead. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn this conference over to Jon Levenson. You may begin. Jon Levenson : Thank you, Chantelle, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. 2019 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division; and Jonathan Zaffino, EVP and President and CEO of the Everest Insurance Division. Before we begin, I need to preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Jon, and good morning. It's my pleasure to join you for the first time as President and CEO of Everest. 2019 was a solid year for our company as we continue to benefit from improving market conditions across all areas of our business. We are well positioned for this market with broad capabilities in top talent, and we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. For the full year 2019, Everest recorded net income of over $1 billion, a significant increase from the prior year and a 12% net income return on equity. Net operating income for 2019 was in excess of $872 million, also a significant improvement over the 2018 result. Our combined ratio for the year was 95.5% compared to 108.8% in 2018 despite $550 million of catastrophe losses during the year. Our book value per share growth was 16%, and we grew our revenues by 8%. We remain focused on our industry-leading expense advantage. We achieved a 6% expense ratio in 2019 while continuing to make significant investments in people, technology and the infrastructure necessary to grow our company. These overall results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise. We had sizable contributions from both our underwriting and investment operations throughout 2019. Specific to the underwriting operations, 2019 demonstrated the success of our strategies in both reinsurance and insurance. For the full year 2019, Everest generated $336 million in underwriting income. In our Reinsurance division, we generated $255 million in underwriting income with a 95.4% combined ratio even with an active catastrophe year with industry insured losses in excess of $50 billion. This result reflects the steps we have taken to diversify our portfolio and reduce volatility. In our Insurance division, 2019 marked another strong year of profitable growth. We finished the year with gross written premium of nearly $2.8 billion, a 23% growth rate, over $81 million in underwriting income and a 95.8% combined ratio. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Global Insurance business, ran a combined ratio in the low 90s for the full year. The Insurance division had pretax operating income of $270 million for the year, including the allocated $189 million of investment income, an excellent result. Overall investment income for the group was $647 million, up 11% over the prior year. Given the prudent investment mix of assets we maintain, this was also an excellent outcome. Overall, our invested assets grew by $2.3 billion in 2019 to nearly $21 billion, driven by record underwriting cash flows and the solid return on invested assets. Turning to the fourth quarter of 2019, overall group results were impacted by $215 million in catastrophe losses and higher-than-expected losses in our crop reinsurance book as a result of inclement weather. This resulted in a group combined ratio of 101.5%. For the quarter, as a result of these losses, our Reinsurance division posted a combined ratio of 103.9% and an underwriting loss of $55 million. Our Insurance division generated over $26 million in underwriting income and a 95.1% combined ratio. Heading into 2020, we remain very well positioned. In our Reinsurance division, we were pleased with our January one renewals, which represents about 50% of our annual reinsurance premium. Underwriting discipline remains paramount, and we were able to underwrite a stronger portfolio with greater balance, diversification, more expected margin and reduced volatility. In our Insurance division, the rate momentum continues to build up meaningfully in virtually every class of business. Our Insurance division is hitting full stride at an ideal time given the market tailwinds. We have the right culture, platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners. We also have the underwriters and systems necessary to capitalize on the current market, with the infrastructure in place to ensure underwriting discipline and appropriate risk selection. Strategically, our focus is on increasing Everest's earnings power in terms of both our underwriting and investment income, with the goal of driving superior book value growth over time. Underwriting profitability will remain at the core of everything we do as we execute on our well-defined premium growth strategies in an improving underwriting environment. We will continue to search for profitable growth opportunities and increase relevance. To use a sports metaphor, we're on the front foot. We will also continue to create optionality and diversification in our business with a broad mix of products, distribution and geography. This allows us to focus our underwriting capital on the most profitable classes, regardless of the environment. With regard to investment income, strong operating cash flows and returns on invested assets will continue to grow our portfolio going forward. Our focus will be on optimizing the performance of our investment portfolio while maintaining a well-balanced and prudent investment posture. The efficient use of our capital facilitates returns on equity significantly in excess of our cost of capital. Our goal is a double-digit return on equity. Our first priority is to deploy capital into the business to position Everest for long-term success and profitable growth. Growth in our earnings power, combined with our strong balance sheet, low leverage, strong financial ratings and the effective management of capital, will position Everest to succeed in every stage of the market cycle. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials. Craig Howie : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest reported net income of $218 million. This compares to a net loss of $385 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income for the full year was over $1 billion compared to net income of $89 million in 2018. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, higher net investment income and lower catastrophe losses compared to 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest saw $215 million of net pretax catastrophe losses compared to $875 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The 2019 pretax loss estimates came from Typhoon Hagibis in Japan for $190 million and the Dallas, Texas Tornado with $25 million. On a full year basis, the results reflected net pretax catastrophe losses of $550 million in 2019 compared to $1.7 billion recorded in calendar year 2018. These losses are pretax figures, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premium. As a reminder, the company uses net after-tax loss estimates when setting its catastrophe loss budget for the year. Excluding the catastrophe events, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior period reserve development, the underlying book continues to perform well with an overall current year attritional combined ratio of 88.4% for the year compared to 87% last year. This increase was primarily due to the business mix in the Reinsurance segment, which has been writing more proportional casualty business over the past several quarters, which carries a higher loss ratio but benefits from the current underwriting market condition, also due to the impact of the current year crop reinsurance losses in 2019 of about $50 million. On reserves, we completed the remainder of our annual loss reserve studies during the fourth quarter. We booked $19 million of favorable prior year reserve development. This is in addition to the $75 million of favorable prior year development reported in the first three quarters of 2019 for a full year total of $94 million. The Insurance segment reported $16 million of favorable prior year reserve development during the quarter, which was largely related to its workers' compensation business. The Reinsurance results - segment reported $3 million of favorable prior year development during the quarter and $77 million for the year. The Reinsurance segment saw favorable development in some short-tail and credit-related lines, such as property, surety, marine and mortgage. This favorable development was offset by actions we took to strengthen reserves in the Bermuda segment for losses on some specific accounts for both property and casualty. Before moving to taxes, I'd like to remind you that we've included a split of our net investment income between the Insurance segment and total reinsurance. This is shown on Page 15 in the financial supplement. It indicates the contribution provided by each segment to pretax operating income and reflects $458 million allocated to reinsurance and $189 million of net investment income allocated to the Insurance segment. We are including this information to better demonstrate the total contribution by business segment and highlights the stand-alone value of the growing insurance franchise. On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of losses associated with the catastrophes this year. Since the majority of the catastrophe events came from business written in the U.S. book, the losses and tax benefit primarily reflect the U.S. tax rate. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that includes planned catastrophe losses for the year. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be about 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about six points of loss ratio. Shareholders' equity for the group ended the year at a record $9.1 billion, up $1.3 billion or 16% compared to year-end 2018. The increase in shareholders' equity is primarily attributable to the over $1 billion of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio. During the quarter, the company announced an 11% increase in its regular quarterly dividend and paid $1.55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. We maintain industry load debt leverage, manage a high credit quality investment portfolio and generate robust cash flow. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Following three years of significant catastrophes and more recent loss development, the 2020 reinsurance market is dynamic, just as our property book in 2019 was a better portfolio compared to 2018. After this January 2020 renewal, we have a stronger, even healthier book across our overall global property portfolio, including property cat, proportional, facultative, per risk, retro and PURPLE treaties with better balance, diversification and limit deployment, and we have improved expected margins while managing the size of our catastrophe PML. We are optimistic about the opportunity set in front of us while remaining realistic that there are choppy waters to navigate in both property and casualty lines. It is an improving market marked by increasing demand for reinsurance with roughly flat reinsurance supply. And for specific deals, pricing was determined by class of business, territory and loss experience. Everest is well positioned in this market given our unique strengths and attributes. These include our long-standing client relationships and robust ability to source business globally with strong balance sheet and strategically located and seasoned underwriting teams empowered to make decisions and execute. At January 1, Everest deployed more capacity in retro; our PURPLE product; loss-affected territories with rate improvements or continued post loss, higher reinsurance rates; casualty; specialty; and facultative lines around the globe. Conversely, we continue to re-underwrite poor performing accounts or accounts which did not have strong pricing. On these programs, we cut back our share or came off. Approaching January 1, we utilized alternative capital to capture value in the improving market. We went back to the cat bond market to renew the expiring Kilimanjaro bonds and utilize the approximately $800 million of AUM in Mt. Logan. Along with in force, cat bonds and other hedges, we holistically built capacity to deploy on deals we like, particularly in retro and PURPLE. At 1/1, we were able to improve profitability of our global cat book, optimizing the risk/reward of the portfolio while managing the volatility. There's been a lot of discussion of the U-shape market pricing dynamics. I think the correct analogy is a W-shape. Why W-shape and not a U-shape? Both exhibit increasing primary and retro rates. But in the U-shape model, reinsurance rates would not move up much at all. However, in the W-shape model, the reinsurance rates, terms and conditions were mixed. Some disappointingly flat and some with nice improvements and continued attractively priced opportunities. That is why we believe a W-shape is a better visualization of the market. First, the left side of the W-shape model, primary insurance. Everest writes a large amount of proportional treaties. We are directly benefiting from improving primary markets in casualty, property and specialty lines, particularly in E&S and in certain capacity-restricted territories such as Canada. Our relevance to our clients and brokers for providing much needed risk transfer, capital support and volatility management helps them capture value in these improved primary markets. Now the middle part of the W-shape model, reinsurance. As I said, results were mixed, some good, some disappointing. Positives were global reinsurance programs, pockets of casualty, mortgage, structured business, many facultative lines and several loss-affected areas. Disappointments included several smaller capacity programs and several cat-free territories. Specifically, at January 1, several large global property programs that tapped out global capacity had improved pricing. Therefore, we wrote more with several large multinational global clients, particularly with our strategic partners. Loss-affected territories impacted by catastrophes over the last three years have substantially better rates, and in some cases, those rates continued to improve. But smaller limit programs, including regional U.S. and smaller clients around the globe, did not see much rate movement. Most of Europe and much of Latin America and Asia were closer to flat. China was down, and we deployed less capacity there. Casualty reinsurance saw a directional improvement in reinsurance rates as well as benefited from primary rate increases, improved terms and limit contraction, resulting in a better priced and better balanced book. There's been a lot of talk about social inflation and increased loss trends in casualty. We believe this is a reversion to the long-term mean as opposed to something new. And this reversion to the mean in trend and loss development is something that we have been underwriting for, pricing for and embedding in our trend factors for several years, prior to this being in the headlines now. Seasons continued to decrease their volatility through a combination of gross line reductions, buying down treaty retentions, buying more casualty reinsurance and buying more facultative reinsurance in both property and casualty. Fac helped seasons manage line size and protect certain rigs that get limited or excluded under treaties during this part of the cycle. Then at the right price, terms and conditions assuming that risk, our seasoned fac teams can specifically underwrite those risks. In the last many months of fac renewals, including this 1/1, we have seen a significant increase in the number of opportunities in fac, both in casualty and property, in the U.S. as well as internationally, much coming with significant rate lift. And mortgage, which has treaties incepting throughout the year, remains a positive driver in reinsurance. Finally, the right side of the W-shape model, retro. At January 1, retro rates were up meaningfully, and we wrote more premiums accordingly. We dusted off our pillared product, PURPLE, and marketed that beyond the few core clients who have been consistent buyers. The end result was roughly a 25% increase in our combined retro and PURPLE premium. Therefore, improving insurance, mixed reinsurance with some bright spots and improved retro results in the W-shaped market. As we look forward to 2020, we see January one momentum continuing throughout the year on reinsurance and retro, including upward pricing pressure both in Japan at April one and also in Florida at June 1. Trapped capital and investor fatigue continue as important drivers in the property space. We see a mixed casualty reinsurance market continuing in 2020 with some reinsurers writing more and some are treating or writing less. This is a function of perception of loss trends, market share and underwriting actions taken over the last several years. As discussed on many prior earnings calls, given casualty underwriting actions we took the last six to eight years, we are optimistic about the current market. Mortgage continues to be a core line for us. We have increased our book and expect to see increased reinsurance demand from the buyers in 2020 and beyond. With proactive optimization, continued re-underwriting and diversifying our global portfolio, we are pleased with the outcome at January one and are well positioned for the future. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon to review our insurance operations. Jonathan Zaffino : Thank you, John, and good morning. Everest insurance completed 2019, delivering another year of solid profitable growth with the strongest underwriting income in many years, and as you heard from Juan, achieving a milestone of $270 million of pretax operating income. Stated simply, the insurance organization is well positioned for continued success in this firming market. Our strategy, thoughtfully executed upon over the past several years, is producing solid results. We continue to increase our relevance within the specialty insurance segment, and most importantly, among our valued clients. We remain optimistic about the future and continue to see meaningful opportunities ahead. This is an underwriter\u2019s market, and we have the platform, the products and outstanding talent to continue to thrive. For the full year 2019, we achieved gross written premium growth of 23% or $2.8 billion. Our net written premium, likewise, grew 22% to $2.1 billion. Over the last two quarters of 2019, we experienced a gross written premium growth rate of 30%, which speaks to the accelerated pace of firming in the market and the increased opportunity set across our global specialty wholesale and retail product offerings. Various underwriting divisions, representing our short, medium and long tail books, all experienced opportunistic growth in the quarter. Our mix remained generally similar to the prior year, with one notable decline in U.S. workers' compensation down 4%, now equaling about 20% of our total writings. While we continue to see opportunity in workers' compensation, we remain cautious in that line of business. Our short-tail and accident and health portfolios remain roughly 30% of our total mix, and our specialty casualty portfolio is also roughly 30%. The balance is made up of our various professional and financial lines offerings. Business originated within the U.S. excess and surplus lines market and London wholesale accounted for nearly 40% of our total premium in 2019. This may scale even further as we continue to see meaningful opportunity through this important channel. Our new business in the quarter was solid once again, and our retention ratio grew in each major distribution segment. Add to this, growth emanating from rate change and all of these factors further contributed to top line performance. As you heard, profitability was solid in both the quarter and year-to-date period. Our year-to-date 2019 result is the strongest underwriting profit in many years and is 6% greater than last year's results on the same basis. The reported loss ratio was essentially flat year-over-year, registering a 65.2 versus 65 in the prior year. However, the attrition loss ratio improved 20 basis points over the prior year coming in at 66 versus 66.2. The expense ratio for the year remained stable, around 30%, while we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure, including our growing international platforms. As an example, we continue to invest heavily in our claims organization to promote better outcomes for Everest and our clients. This includes the recruitment of outstanding talent across every level of our claims group as well as investments across our operational infrastructure enabled by technology. Further, we have migrated claims handling away from TPAs and several key product lines and geographies to our in-house claims teams and are very pleased with the results thus far. We will further enhance this important aspect of our organization in 2020. As we look to the rate environment, we see accelerating rate improvement across most of the market. In the quarter, we experienced pure rate increases, which excludes the impact of exposure of 12% excluding workers' compensation and 7.9% year-to-date on the same basis. This is the largest increasing in many years and continues to be led by double-digit rate increases within our property portfolio. Financial lines and umbrella excess are also showing significant improvement, registering double-digit rate increases as well. And in the case of excess casualty, rate increases are in the high teens. Encouragingly, we also see primary general liability rates moving up in the fourth quarter as well to the mid-single-digit range. Every major line of business we underwrite showed improvement in rate change momentum in the fourth quarter. As we have previously noted, we remained very well positioned to take advantage of this improved pricing environment in terms of our people, product set and our ability to offer solutions to clients in this evolving market. Most importantly, all of these actions continue to drive meaningful income in the insurance organization. In conclusion, we entered 2020 with excellent momentum. Our global platform, extensive global distribution and, most importantly, talented team continued to differentiate Everest insurance in the market. Having recently hosted our 2020 Underwriting Summit, a gathering of our top underwriting leadership across the world, I can assure you the team is focused and prepared to continue executing on our key underwriting directives. We look forward to reporting back to you on our progress next quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chantelle for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question kind of I guess trying to tie together a few things you guys said in the prepared remarks. It sounds like your cat load should be lower in 2020. I think you guys said around six points relative to where it's been trending. But then it sounds like you guys saw some good opportunity, both on the reinsurance and the retro side at 1/1? So is that more a function of just some also good growth you're seeing on the casualty side of things? I'm just trying to lump that all together and why your cat load will be down if you're seeing good growth on the cat side? Juan Andrade : Yes Elyse, this is Juan. So let me start then I'll ask John Doucette to add to this as well. So as you pointed out, we did see a very good opportunity in the retro market at 1/1. We continue to see a good economic bet from the perspective of rate momentum. We were also successful in moving further up in attachment points, et cetera. So for us that was really a very good opportunity. And as a result of that, you will also continue to see our volatility continue to improve, as both John Doucette and I mentioned in our prepared remarks. I think you will see that in our numbers throughout the year. Now with regards to casualty, we also continue to see pretty good opportunity on the reinsurance side, essentially for all the reasons that we mentioned, with the improvement in the primary side of things, particularly in general liability and some of the improvements that we've seen in excess casualty as well, and given the fact we are providing proportional treaties with some key clients, that was also a pretty good opportunity for us up in the 1/1 period. John Doucette : Yes, good morning Elyse, this is John Doucette and just wanted to follow-up a couple of things. So, yes, we did see opportunities in certain pockets of the reinsurance, and we saw opportunities in retro and Purple. We also saw places within the property area in the reinsurance that we didn't like, and we scaled back accordingly, and that freed up some of the cat load for us to deploy elsewhere. We also talked about and deployed additional hedges, reloaded the cat bonds. And they came in lower, which also freed up some of the EL. And then as Juan said, really trying to continue to diversify the book, which is growth in casualty, growth in mortgage and growth in facultative and specialty non-cat-exposed lines of business as well. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then, Craig, you mentioned you were kind of going down into some of the pushes and the pulls in terms of the reserve development. In terms of Bermuda segment, I guess the net number is a small number for the quarter. But could we just get a little bit more color on what you strengthened in terms of property and casualty accounts and the size within that segment? Craig Howie : Sure, Elyse. First of all as you said, we did take some specific action for both property and casualty in the Bermuda segment. For property, we primarily strengthened reserves for one account, which we no longer write, and also a specific loss related to some very older years. In the casualty side, we strengthened reserves for some specific accounts, including a nonstandard auto account that we wrote in 2015 and 2016. We no longer write this account. The other thing, as you mentioned, there are some puts and takes and there always are. We have over 200 IBNR scenarios. And so you're always going to see some ups and downs. But the other thing that's going on in the Bermuda segment this quarter is we had a one-time commutation of a contract. So that actually served to reduce prior period reserves by about $20 million, and it was offset by about a $20 million commission paid. So essentially, no material impact to the underwriting results in the quarter. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then one last question did you guys see any movement in any catastrophe losses, prior year cats in the quarter that offset each other? Or it was just kind of not much movement there in the quarter? Craig Howie : There's always some movement up and down, Elyse, with respect to catastrophe losses. But overall, our current - our prior year catastrophe losses continue to hold, and there was no overall movement. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : Maybe a good commentary in the prepared remarks especially on pricing is there a way to try to frame, I know there's a lot of moving parts, maybe kind of loss cost inflation on the primary insurance casualty side? Are you - is it still kind of stable quarter-over-quarter or some companies are saying it's kind of inching a little higher, curious if any color there? John Doucette : Good morning Mike, this is John. We definitely - let me go back to sort of what we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we definitely saw a meaningful uptick in the rate environment in the second half of the year. As you mentioned, every line of business has a bit of a different dynamic. We obviously have a process for tracking or viewing rate and trend assumptions across all of our lines of business. But I would tell you that we feel quite confident that the written rate is exceeding trend in virtually every area. It will take a little bit of time for that to earn through. And this is a comment a bit export comp, of course. But even in that case, we're still seeing negative frequency trends. So we're watching all of this. The uptick as I mentioned, of 12% in the quarter ex-comp, that's up from 7.5% in the third quarter, 6.5% in the second quarter, so you get the feel. So we feel really good about the rate environment. We like where we're heading, and we do believe on a rate basis, we are exceeding trend in almost every area. Mike Zaremski : And lastly, if I look at the paid to incurred loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, it seems like it ticked up a little bit, and it's above 100%. Anything you'd call out there or is it just normal variability? Craig Howie : I think that's just normal variability, Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Kumar, Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Two follow-up questions, the first question goes back, I think to the first question regarding the shift in business mix in the reinsurance segment, casualty market conditions as well as the cat market conditions. When we think about 2020, would that imply based on the shift that the AY ex cat loss ratio should tick-up or not? Juan Andrade : So Amit, this is Juan. So look I think let me address it in a couple of different ways. So I think, number one, we are seeing a very programmatic shift in business mix in the company. It's something that we started really in 2019, and it will continue into 2020 as we look to manage volatility on the property cat side of things. And that's essentially the commentary that you've heard from both John and I. As far as basically being able to shape a book particularly at the 1/1 renewals, with lower volatility, better margin, et cetera, et cetera. At the same time, it's also the commentary regarding our mortgage book of business, which we continue to see as a terrific opportunity for the company, as well as pockets in casualty. And again, that's not across the board. We are very discerning underwriters in that sense, but we do see pockets of opportunity as we see the primary rates go up, as we see opportunities for tighter terms and conditions and for us to be able to play in that environment. So from that perspective, I think that makes us real. And let me turn it over to John. John Doucette : Yes good morning Amit. So there are a couple of countervailing currents, and Juan touched on a couple I'll just add. So like what Jon Zaffino said on the primary side, we are seeing, when it comes to the proportional treaties we write in short and certainly in long-tail lines. We're seeing in specialty lines, we are seeing the rate lift. So we have changing mix of business, which is changing our attritional. We also see the rate changes. But similarly as Jon Zaffino said, we would expect that to take a while to earn into the numbers. So net-net-net, we probably look to the full year's attritional loss ratio as a good guide. Amit Kumar : And the second and I guess final question. Going back to the discussion on the reserve parts movement, if we were to step back, the reserve release number is lower than the prior quarter's trend line. And again, I know that one should not look at any sort of repeat of past patterns. But that said, the number is lower than what it has been in the past was that - maybe this question might be for you, Juan. Is that because of your enrollment, maybe something you saw, maybe just talk about that a bit more? Juan Andrade : Sure, Amit. Look, keep in mind also that we released a total of $94 million in 2019. So while we had $19 million in this quarter, there was also $75 million in releases in prior quarters throughout 2019. That being said, we do have an ongoing and dynamic process to review our reserves. We do recognize bad news quickly, and we require good news to be proven over a longer period of time. As we do these reserve studies, and if we identify an area where we do need to strengthen, we will take a range of actions. We will increase our loss reserves already on the books, we will increase our current senior loss fix, and we will adjust our pricing targets for new and renewal business. And I think that's some of what you heard Craig described, particularly for the Bermuda segment in the quarter. But also keep in mind that, I think as Jon Zaffino said, while in most classes in this current market, the rate that's being achieved is outpacing the loss trend. In our business, we do need to see results season over time. So that leads me to take a position that is cautious upfront, but frankly, willing to have an upside surprise in the future. So in the meantime, we review, we analyze, we act on our portfolio throughout the year, and that's basically the approach that we will follow and that you saw in this quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar, Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Good morning everybody. I guess my first question is around third-party capital. So I think both Mt. Logan and Kilimanjaro capital is down year-over-year. How much of that is a function of the markets or external pressure, timing? Or how much of that is just a function of Everest shrinking the gross property cat exposure growing its equity base? John Doucette : Good morning Yarn, it's John. So as we talked about, we have this - we've talked about before, we tried to have a holistic hedging program across the cat bonds, across Logan, across traditional and other nontraditional hedges that we have in place to really allow us to have the portfolio match the best capital to risk, manage the P&Ls and reduce the volatility. And we'll dynamically allocate between those based on market conditions, capital availability, really to try to set it up where we're serving our clients and our shareholders the best. In terms of specifically Logan and Kilimanjaro, so cat bonds in general for the entire industry are more out of the money, lower return periods. And they haven't had as many losses over the last couple of years, although there have been some. So there was - capital was tighter there, but we didn't see the same withdrawal to the same extent that more of the alternative capital playing in the sidecars and other kind of just straight up taking reinsurance or retro risks. So I think there was more availability there. And we had specifically decided that we wanted to move this - the new cat bonds lower more into the money and less just to be in the tail. So from an EL relief, actually despite it being less dollars of limit purchased, it was more EL relief than the expiring bonds that we had in place. And in terms of Logan, it really - there's a lot of moving dynamics. There's investors that have come in. There's investors that have scaled up. There's investors that have come out. There are investors that have scaled back. There is clearly - this is an industry comment, not an Everest or Logan comment, but there is investor fatigue with the losses and some of the surprise losses. So I would say, overall, third-party capital is tight right now. You still have trapped capital, even going back to '17, certainly from '18, and then Jebi happening. I mean Jebi and the development there as well as the recent Japanese losses closer to the renewal season also resulted in more trapped capital. So I think net-net, the third-party capital is tighter, and we'll continue to see that throughout 2019. Juan Andrade : Yaron, the only thing I would add is that the way we access alternative capital in the end of the year and to 1/1 really allowed us to build the capacity to deploy and to improve 1/1 market, as we discussed earlier, particularly to our retro and PURPLE products, while helping us to manage our volatility and our P&L. And so for us, that was very strategic. Yaron Kinar : Understood, I appreciate the thoughtful answer. And then my next question, probably for Jon Zaffino on the insurance side. So margins - underlying margins seemed very stable year-over-year, had a pretty good ratio there. But nonetheless, I think we did see an uptick at the end of the year, both in the expense ratio and the loss ratio, underlying loss ratio? Can you maybe talk about that and is that just normal volatility or is that something that you really maybe - was a step change or a small step change, I guess, into the end of the year? Jonathan Zaffino : Yes, thanks for the question. Let me try to provide some additional color on this. So let me - I'll start with taking on a couple of parts. First off, as you mentioned, we do think the year-to-date number is a better gauge and more reflective of our performance. As respect to the attritional loss ratio and that 140 basis point increase you saw in the quarter, there is noise in the quarter emanating predominantly from an unallocated loss adjustment expense, a UA expense catch-up that affected the attritional loss ratio. Excluding that catch-up, the pure attritional loss ratio actually declined by about 100 basis points. Then again on a year-to-date basis, the attritional is flat basically for the full year. I also want to add, and if you recall in prior calls, we did take a more conservative view of our work comp book earlier in the year. So, on a year-to-date basis, that's also creating about a 70 basis point headwind, if you will to the year-over-year comparative. As respects, the expense ratio, as Craig mentioned, we experienced favorable prior period development in our work comp book as we have for the past couple of years, and associated with that was a one-time profit commission, which caused the commission ratio to go up a bit in the quarter. Absent of that, we had about a 200 basis point improvement in the commission ratio. And secondly, there were some timing issues associated with expense accruals in 4Q. And we also had some prior year lower incentive comp accruals based on company performance, et cetera. So that just hopefully gives you a little bit of color as to sort of what was going on in the quarter. But again, we think the full year numbers are more indicative of our run rate and our trend. Operator : Our next question will come from Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : I want to look at the reserves from maybe a different perspective. When we look on a full year basis, we're seeing a little bit of a decrease in dollars of reserve release. Is it fair to say that the gap between the conservative numbers that you're booking and the ASCO numbers out there that, that gap is shrinking? Craig Howie : Meyer, overall, I would say, the conservative numbers that we're booking come from how we select our loss picks over a long period of time. In other words, that's part of our annual planning process, and we take into account factors like rate change and loss trend and historical loss ratios. And as we set those reserves, we go through this process with our reserving actuaries, our pricing actuaries, our underwriting and our claims area as well as management. We select from various metrics, whether that be prior year loss selections, the plan, the bridge, which takes into account our - both rate and trend. And then we also have the reserve studies that come from the reserving actuaries. And then we also look at how the business is priced and how the underwriters select those loss picks. We go through that. We also compare that to our actual reported loss experience. And then we modify it each quarter as we go through the reserve committee meetings and the underlying assumptions. As I said before, we have over 200 IBNR categories that we look at, and some are - some go up each quarter, and some come down each quarter as we look at this and as we go through the reserve studies. So what I would say to you is the process has not changed. We continue to go through that process. We continue to quickly recognize unfavorable development that we're seeing in that process, but we tend to hold or recognize favorable development over a much longer period of time. So as I would say to you and I've said to you before, we continue to hold the more recent years. And again, this quarter, we took action on some specific accounts. But overall, the process has not changed over time. Meyer Shields : Second question, I guess international reinsurance had a phenomenal attritional loss ratio. Was there anything unusual or was that just a true-up for the full year? Craig Howie : Essentially, for international it's not necessarily a true-up. What I would say to you is in that - in those areas of the world, and what I'm talking about here are Latin America, Brazil, Middle East and Africa. What we saw was fewer non-catastrophe-type storms in those regions, which allowed us to take down what we would call property-related loss picks that would fall below our cat threshold for that period. So that's what you're seeing come down in the fourth quarter for that region. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Meredith, UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes thanks, just a couple of quick ones here. First, what was the impact of the crop loss in the quarter on the underlying combined ratio at reinsurance? And was it all U.S. reinsurance or was it elsewhere as well? Craig Howie : So it happened in two separate regions, Brian. But essentially, it's $50 million. Brian Meredith : Yes. Craig Howie : And the two separate regions are U.S. reinsurance as well as it happened in Canada as well. So from a total reinsurance perspective overall, the $50 million is about 3.5 points for the quarter and about one point overall for the year. Brian Meredith : And then I guess, one bigger picture question, curious, for Juan and Jon. Given the magnitude of growth that you're seeing right now in your insurance operation can you talk about - I mean and I see that obviously, your expenses are up, so you're kind of adding people and stuff. Talk about how you get comfortable with the magnitude of growth that's going on right now. I mean I know it's a good rate environment, but substantial, substantial growth has done and how you're controlling that? Juan Andrade : Yes, sure so let me start that, and then I'll hand it over to Jon Zaffino. So I think it's important to recognize where the growth is coming from, right? And I think as Jon illustrated in his prepared remarks, it's really from a couple of buckets right so increased rate is certainly part of that. Keeping in mind that we did have a 12% increase in rate in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, so that's certainly part of the lift. The other part of the lift that we're seeing is about 40% of our business and growing is exposed to the E&S space, which is really where we've seen the majority of the opportunity come up at this point in time. We also had very good renewal retention. If we look at our retail book of business, it's really in the mid to high 80s, and our E&S retention is in a good place. So you look at those three things : an increase in rate, opportunity particularly in the E&S space, solid renewal retention. And on top of that, you add the fact that we've added about 60 additional underwriters throughout 2019 and starting to get essentially the picture where that growth is coming from. Now specific to your question on how we manage this, et cetera. That is some of the investments that you're seeing us continue to make, both in technology as well as infrastructure for the company. One of the things too that I think is unique to us is that we have a very focused distribution footprint, and so we know who has the business that we want. We're trying to increase the shelf space with them, and we're not out there buying to basically grow with everybody. So that also allows us to have a much more focused presence from a distribution standpoint that's out there. But investments in technology, investments in our target operating model, et cetera all basically give us comfort that the growth that we're seeing is something that is sustainable for us, which at the end of the day, is really the most important thing, it\u2019s really sustainable, profitable growth. Jon? Jonathan Zaffino : Yes no I think thanks Juan that's really well said. I would just sort of maybe echo a couple of Juan's points here. Number one and you could see it in the supplement, our growth is balanced and diversified across our chosen product areas and maybe to amplify a couple of Juan's points. Our growth in the E&S market is growing faster than our top line overall. So we are taking advantage of that. So the comment on our rate and exposure lift, that accounted for about 20% of our growth in the fourth quarter, so just to give you an order of magnitude there. And then yes, we're well positioned with our trading partners. The value they see and what Everest can bring to the table is creating basically record submission flows. We're well into the 150,000-plus submission activity. So, all that together in conjunction to what Juan said, is what's sort of creating this environment. Operator : Thank you very much. At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments. Juan Andrade : Well, thank you for your questions and allowing us to talk about the year and the quarter. As I mentioned before, we are very well positioned for 2020. We were very pleased with our 1/1 renewals, and we're excited with the momentum that we continue to see in our insurance business going forward. So with that, we look forward to updating you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time this now concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Thank you, Nadia, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance division. We are also joined today by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in its filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. First and foremost, I hope you, your families, your friends and your neighbors are all staying healthy and safe. On behalf of our company, I want to offer our heartfelt condolences to all of those, including many in the Everest Re family who have lost loved ones during this difficult time. Our sincere thanks go to those medical professionals and first responders who are putting themselves at risk to keep everyone safe. Also, to all of those who are working hard to keep the supply chains going : the truck drivers, delivery drivers, grocery store employees and everyone else, thank you. I also want to thank all of Everest employees for their spirit and their unflagging commitment to serve our customers. We took early, proactive and decisive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, their families and our stakeholders. As a result, Everest continues to successfully operate remotely. We are doing our part in support of the global economy by serving all of our customers and stakeholders without interruption. Our move to remote work was planful with a well-executed organizational resiliency plan and an underlying technology infrastructure that performs seamlessly and an information technology organization that has performed admirably. Our employees have been flexible, resilient and productive. We have received accolades regarding our responsiveness and our stability. We also continue to support our local communities around the world in their pandemic relief efforts. These are leadership moments for people and companies. Our culture of collaboration, thoughtful assumption of risk, humility and relentless execution are at the bedrock of our performance. I am incredibly proud of our people and our company. Our diversified global platform, with its broad mix of products, distribution and geography, remains an important source of stable capacity to our broker partners and customers. Our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets, significant liquidity and low financial leverage. Despite the pandemic and the economic downturn, Everest remains profitable, as reflected in our reported 98.6% combined ratio or 89.9% excluding catastrophe losses and the pandemic IBNR loss provision. Additionally, Everest remains resilient, as reflected by both our 21% growth rate in gross written premium and by our capital position. We have built a strong capital foundation over the years, holding $8.6 billion of shareholders' equity at March 31, 2020. While this is a decrease from year-end 2019, this decrease primarily results from : one, the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio, which has now substantially recovered since the end of the quarter; two, share repurchases and dividends paid; and three, the pandemic loss IBNR provision. Most importantly, our capital position continues to exceed what we need to run the business with excess capital relative to rating agency and regulatory requirements. We have substantial liquidity from the cash we hold, and the cash flow from operations, which was over $0.5 billion for the quarter, were up 10% from 2019. We have significant access to capital markets, including plenty of debt capacity as we carry very little debt compared to all of our peers at less than 7% of our capital when most of our peers typically carry upwards of 20% to 30%. Lastly, our industry leading expense ratio also gives us operating flexibility, which is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. Turning to the first quarter of 2020. Everest remains strong and is well positioned with broad capabilities and top talent. And we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We demonstrated excellent momentum across both of our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 16% and 33%, respectively. We also continued to benefit from improved market conditions during the quarter, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, our underlying combined ratios for the group at 89.9% and each of our divisions, Reinsurance at 87.7% and Insurance at 95.6%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of the franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. Our Reinsurance division had a strong January 1 renewal season. We continue to judiciously deploy capital, and we underwrote a high-performing book that is focused on strong economic returns while improving the diversification and balance of our overall portfolio. We also saw stronger opportunities in several areas such as retro and facultative risk. As the quarter progressed, we saw continued momentum across the portfolio. John Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions and the underlying growth. Our Insurance division's growth remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. The drivers for this growth were : number one, strong and widespread rate momentum. Excluding workers' compensation, the rate increase was plus 24% or plus 17% net of a handful of large deals booked in the quarter and over 12% including workers' compensation. This is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019 where the rate increase was almost plus 12% excluding workers' compensation and plus 4% all in. We also saw continued strength in the E&S space with strong submission flow and market conditions continuing to tighten in property and casualty in both primary and excess lines. We also had strong renewal retention in both our retail and wholesale businesses. And we had increased productivity resulting from additional underwriters hired in 2019 that are now fully onboarded and providing capacity to address the increased submission flow. The insurance growth was also balanced and diversified across our many lines of business. Strong rate and tightening terms drove the growth in the long-tail line. Despite the impacts of the pandemic in the quarter, our underlying insurance portfolio continues to perform well, and we are seeing the benefits of our various investments in portfolio optimization efforts, all of which position us well for this environment. Turning to investments. Net investment income of $148 million was up 5% from the first quarter of 2019. Our investment portfolio had been and is defensively positioned with over 75% in investment-grade fixed income bonds and less than 4% allocated to public equities. Most of our risk is bond risk, and we also have the ability to hold bonds until they mature. In addition, we\u2019ve continued to further reposition our portfolio, moving up in fixed income credit quality and reducing equity exposure. As per our April 23 announcement, we\u2019ve taken $150 million IBNR loss provision in the first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses relate to event cancellation, business interruption and other coverages such as accident and health and workers' compensation. Our estimate was based on an analysis completed during the first quarter. This analysis was a thorough cross-functional review of the in-force portfolio by line of business, industry and geography. The review was completed by a team of professionals representing every area of the company. Given the fluid and continuing nature of this pandemic, this is an ongoing event and so is our analysis. While our analysis looked at all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate does not take into account legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. As stated in our release, our philosophy is to recognize and react to expected future losses on a timely basis. We will be tracking pandemic losses separately from our attritional losses and as an ongoing event. With regard to our specialty insurance business, we\u2019ve limited exposure to event cancellation, accident and health, workers' compensation and business interruption. Our property policies have unambiguous policy language that requires direct physical loss for business interruption coverage to be triggered. Additionally, the majority of the property policies in force contain a virus exclusion. Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sub-limits typically less than $25,000 and with short-duration caps that would offer BI for a notable -- notifiable human disease. These exposures have already been recognized as part of the overall IBNR loss estimate for the quarter. The majority of the IBNR loss provision was for the Reinsurance business given the relative size of this portfolio compared to our Insurance businesses. It is important to note that as a reinsurer, we\u2019ve contractual terms and conditions, such as retentions, limits, event definitions, hours clauses and other coverage provisions that will apply to this ongoing event. Thus, we do not simply follow the fortunes. It will be very fact-specific. We\u2019ve also done a thorough review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. Based on our view of the economic situation that is aided by both external information and our own proprietary internal modeling, we currently believe that our loss picks and reserves remain adequate. We will continue evaluating this business as the economic situation unfolds. In summary, Everest showed forward momentum, resiliency and profitability in the first quarter of 2020. We effectively transitioned to running our company remotely. And as always, we'll remain a consistent and trusted provider of capacity to our customers. Given the uncertainties in the current public health and economic environment, there could be an adverse impact on results for the property and casualty industry and Everest for the remaining part of the year. The impact is clearly dependent on the shape and length of the recovery. While the economic environment has changed, Everest remains a high quality franchise with broad capabilities, a global platform and top talent. We remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. We have the right culture, the right platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners and the capital base to see us through this time. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials. Craig? Craig Howie : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported net income of $17 million for the first quarter of 2020. This compares to net income of $355 million for the first quarter of 2019. Net income included $172 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $74 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. The 2020 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. Operating income for the quarter was $164 million driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable net investment income and lower catastrophe losses, offset by a COVID-19 pandemic IBNR loss estimate of $150 million. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $29 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $196 million in the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2020, Everest saw $30 million of catastrophe losses related to fires and hailstorms in Australia and a tornado in Nashville, Tennessee. This compares to $25 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2019. Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. The combined ratio was 98.6% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 88.7% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe events and the impact of the COVID pandemic, comparable combined ratios were 89.9% for the first quarter of 2020 and 87.4% for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, the attritional loss ratio was 61.5%, up from 60.2% for the full-year 2019 primarily due to the continued change in business mix. For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.8%, up from 58.2% for the full year of 2019. This increase was related to the continued business mix shift toward more pro rata premium, which carry a higher loss pick but allow us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. Pro rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earn into our results as we lap the loss tax season over time. For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, remained very steady at 66.1%, essentially flat compared to 66.0% for the full-year 2019. As you can see in the financial supplement, we also experienced more growth in areas that typically carry a higher loss pick and -- but a lower overall combined ratio. Our U.S. insurance franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 22% was down slightly compared to prior year. The group expense ratio remains low at 6.3% and was higher than last year due to an increase in nonrecurring incentive compensation, benefits and payroll taxes in the first quarter, which will normalize during the rest of the year. Before moving to investments, I'd like to point out that we are now reporting two segments : Reinsurance and Insurance. This is consistent with the way the business is managed and the way management views the company's results. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $148 million for the quarter from our $20 billion investment portfolio. Investment income was 5% above the first quarter of last year. This result was primarily driven by the increase in investment-grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year, and higher limited partnership income quarter-over-quarter. Since we report most partnership income on a quarter lag, the global equity market performance in the first quarter will be reflected in the limited partnership investment results in the second quarter. The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, about flat compared to one year-ago. For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter. Other income included $21 million of foreign exchange gains in the quarter. On income taxes, the $60 million tax benefit for the quarter included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which extended the carryback period for cat losses to 5 years. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 12%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full-year. Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $506 million compared to $460 million for the first quarter of 2019. This increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019 and an increase in cash flow from our ongoing growth in insurance and reinsurance premiums. Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The movement in shareholders' equity since year-end 2019 is primarily attributable to the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio and by capital return for $200 million of share buybacks and $63 million of dividends paid in the quarter. The reduction in investment portfolio valuation came from the realized losses in the equity portfolio and the $248 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets resulting from the widening of credit spreads. These mark-to-market adjustments have substantially recovered since the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we made some tactical adjustments to reposition the portfolio by moving up in credit quality and further reducing our equity exposure. As Juan said, our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets, significant liquidity and low financial leverage in addition to our robust cash flow. The strength of our balance sheet is critical to the success of our business. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Juan did at the start of the call, I would like to add my sympathies to our reinsurance trading partners and their families affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Like the rest of the group, the Reinsurance division, supported by our dedicated IT colleagues and our newly completed next-generation global underwriting platform was able to transition to 100% work from home without missing a beat. We are reviewing submissions, quoting and binding facultative and treaty business and settling claims. Now I will review the quarter. During Q1, the Reinsurance division increased our gross written premium to a record of $1.8 billion, up 16% from last year. Q1 growth was driven by January rate increases in loss-exposed areas and retro and writing more PURPLE products and casualty business due to improving conditions there. Growth was widespread, spanning territories and lines, including the U.S., international, casualty and property and short- and long-tail facultative reinsurance. Excluding COVID-19 losses, our underlying reinsurance loss ratio was up by two points largely due to more pro rata premium written over the last year. Pro rata business directly benefits from an improvement in original rates while ceding commissions have generally been stable and, in some cases, improved. Those improved original rates will take some time to be recognized in our loss picks. Note that the volatility associated with $1 of pro rata premium is generally lower than $1 of excess premium, and combined ratio alone can obscure risk-adjusted returns. We are pleased both with our progress at building a more diversified, profitable, sustainable gross portfolio and that we are seeing some tailwinds in the reinsurance market in casualty, property, retro, specialty and fac to help us achieve a stronger, more profitable portfolio. Everest's facultative operations continue to see an increase in demand. In the U.S. and international, we\u2019re continuing to see significant double-digit rate increases in short-tail and long tail fac, with dramatic increase in submission count. Given that facultative renews on multiple inception dates, it is a good forward indicator of reinsurance demand and pricing. For our casualty business, original rates on certain lines have shown some increases, which will earn through on our pro rata premiums. As always, we\u2019re deploying our shareholders' capital judiciously, seeking to build the strongest reinsurance portfolio possible while maximizing returns, while limiting our downside risk through increased diversification and balance. Now to comment on recent and upcoming renewals. April renewals showed continued rate momentum in loss-affected and capacity constrained segments. Japanese wind and retro rates showed strong increases, consistent with the need to maintain appropriate returns. Looking near term, particularly the upcoming June Florida renewals, we expect rates will be affected by limited capacity, recent losses and the market's heightened sensitivity to risk due to climate change and social inflation. Also, there is a strain on alternative capital, traditionally large players in Florida. Therefore, we continue to see upward pricing momentum in Florida along with improved terms and conditions. Now turning to mortgage. With the ongoing economic disruption, primary mortgage insurers could see increased losses along with regulatory capital pressure. However, housing fundamentals are stronger today than they were heading into the financial crisis with higher credit scores, tighter housing supply and lower-risk products. Our reinsurance mortgage book is seasoned and pegged conservatively. To give you some color on our mortgage book. By limit, our book is roughly 80% GSEs and 20% mortgage insurance. Virtually all business we write is on a QM basis. The underwriting box we participate in is very controlled and tightly underwritten, meaning our portfolio has no exotic products and has high FICO scores particularly on the GSE business. From the beginning of Everest entering the mortgage space, our pricing assumptions were and remain more conservative than the external vendor models that we use to validate our pricing assumptions. Regarding the MI treaties we reinsure, we effectively play in an excess position, thus avoiding the working layer losses and resulting in a meaningful buffer in gross loss ratio deterioration before we suffer any economic loss to our reinsurance treaties. Deterioration in this buffer range decreases the size of the profit commissions we would typically pay to the MIs, but at no economic cost to us. Regarding our GSE business, given our more conservative view of underwriting, pricing and capital modeling, we preferred higher layers over lower layers in these programs, and we\u2019ve weighted our book to higher attachment points accordingly. Much of our exposure has been seasoned for several years, which benefits from home price appreciation. Going forward, credit standards at nearly all stages of mortgage origination are tightening and improving, therefore increasing the credit quality of borrowers in our book. Additionally, early government intervention in the economic crisis to support borrowers and lenders, including the broad offering of forbearance, will mitigate potential losses and help keep people in their homes and avoid default. We\u2019re continually reevaluating the dynamics of this economically sensitive line to prudently manage our mortgage exposures now and on a go-forward basis. Now I will give some comments on the overall market ahead. Despite the uncertainty the industry faces, we cautiously anticipate that the reinsurance markets will remain healthy for the highly rated traditional reinsurers who can deploy capacity in multiple lines of business around the world, while also meeting clients' increasing counterparty credit requirements. This view is based on current reinsurance industry dynamics and the supply-demand curve. Starting with the market supply. More stable capital remains in place, while some of the opportunistic capital is exiting. Alternative capital investors are reevaluating the thesis that reinsurance is a non-correlated asset class. Potential uncertainty from COVID-19 and the possibility of more trapped capital compounds frustrations of these investors from the last 3 years of cats and subsequent loss creep from several events. This is in addition to higher relative return hurdle requirements given the increased price of risk across virtually all risk asset classes. On the demand side, clients have increased reinsurance purchases for risk management and capital support particularly as some of them come under capital or earnings pressure given the volatile markets. The flight to quality continues as reinsurance buyers and brokers are increasingly focused on the stability and quality of counterparties to protect program continuity and mitigate counterparty credit exposures in these volatile times. The length of the economic downturn will ultimately be a key factor impacting reinsurance demand. These market dynamics benefit Everest as we deliver stable capacity with strong security as a long-standing client-focused partner. Regardless of where the market turns, we will focus our capacity on those clients that align with our philosophy of prudent underwriting and sound claims handling practices. In summary, Everest is built to withstand volatility and uncertainty such as we\u2019re seeing now. We continue to prove our resilience, our solution-driven partnerships with long-standing clients and our ability to execute through these unprecedented times. Thank you, and now I will turn it back over to Jon Levenson. Jon Levenson : Great. Thanks, John. We would like to open-up the call for questions. We would ask today, if you could please limit to one question. And then if you do have a follow-up with another question, you could please rejoin the queue. We are hoping to get a lot of questions today. Nadia, could you please open up for Q&A? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning and thanks for all the commentary in the prepared remarks. My first question, I will go with mortgage insurance. I think many investors feel that ultimately, the vast majority of mortgage borrowers who defer or miss payments will ultimately cure. But it would be helpful if maybe you can help us size up kind of where your excess layers kind of kick in from maybe a loss ratio standpoint, but some kind of framework to understand if you guys kind of play in the 100% combined ratio and up on, when we're looking at the mortgage insurers or kind of how to frame your exposure there. Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think to echo some of the comments that John Doucette made in his opening remarks, from our perspective, I think there's really three things to consider. Number one is where we play as a reinsurer; and number two, the fact that we see this more as a frequency driven event essentially driven by unemployment. And so that certainly helps our view of all of this. The other part of that is that unlike the 2008 financial crisis, I think as we look at the mortgage products, the better original underwriting, I think, here will pay off. There's also much earlier intervention by the government, much tighter supply of housing, too. We also believe we have some very conservative loss picks on this. But let me ask John to answer your question more specifically on structure. John? John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan, and good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So again, I think you need to think of the world in two different buckets. One is on the mortgage insurance side, and one is on the GSE side. So on the GSE side, that's really more like a credit mortgage catastrophe. And so it's hard to map that to a loss ratio because as Juan said, there is frequency and severity tied to different percentages of default. So it's not really a loss ratio. On the mortgage insurance side, these are typically quota share deals. But then as I mentioned, given the profit commissions that go back, it roughly -- it's effectively like an excess deal that it catches at about an 80 combined ratio. Mike Zaremski : Okay. And on the GSE side, is there a way to frame maybe what -- is it a cumulative loss of like 2.5%, or any numbers you could put around on the GSE side that could help us? John Doucette : Yes. And it will vary by layer. I would just go back to the point I did say, which is -- so some of the GSEs have broad layers that they offer one layer, so -- and a much bigger stretch. Other ones have various layers. And where we had the opportunity, we'd typically play higher up on the -- further remote away from risk. But it's hard to map it to -- there's a lot of moving parts to the answer as to what the default rates are and things like that. And it's very much a function of -- because the GSEs also have the benefit of an earned cover from the MI. So if there is MI insurance on it, so there's -- it's not a -- there is no simple linear answer on that about what the default is. It depends on the type of the default, the frequency, severity, what drove it. Mike Zaremski : Understood. My last question, switching gears to primary insurance. I think one of the most frequent questions we receive is trying to understand whether each insurer has a material amount of policies, property-related business interruption policies that may not have a virus exclusion specifically. And I know -- I think part of the IBNR charge you took included business interruption, but is there any way you could frame whether you -- a portion of your book doesn't have a virus exclusion and whether you are reserving or making some reserves for those policies? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I would go to -- this is Juan, and I would go back to my prepared remarks where I basically said that the majority of the property policies in the primary insurance book do contain a virus exclusion. And we only have a very small -- frankly, it's a very, very small segment where we do offer sub-limited coverage and I mentioned that it's less than $25,000 with very short gaps on duration. And all of that is included in the estimate that we put up for the quarter. Mike Zaremski : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. First question, probably for Juan. I think in your opening comments, you said that you had limited exposures in the Insurance segment to workers' comp among others. I was hoping that maybe you could help us -- or maybe explain how you come to that determination in the context of workers' comp premiums, I think, account for about 1/5 of the segment GPW? Juan Andrade : Yes, I would be happy to talk to you about that. I would say, number one is we really don't have exposure to frontline first responders and very minimal exposure to the frontline health workers, the health care workers in the portfolio. So that essentially is how we come to that conclusion. So as we went through this very thorough process that I mentioned, we looked at industry profile for businesses that we deemed essential. And that's where the IBNR provision really was put up for those kinds of businesses. But again, when you look at those industries that would be most affected, health care workers, first responders, etcetera, we\u2019ve very minimal exposure in the portfolio. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And if you broaden that -- the more broad category of essential workers, how would you think about that? Juan Andrade : Yes, and that\u2019s essentially the provision that is included in the IBNR that we put up for the quarter. So if you look at our total workers' compensation book, again, the exposure to health care workers, first responders is not there. When it comes back to what we consider to be essential workers, that is really the provision that was taken for the quarter. So we believe that we've already accrued for that. Yaron Kinar : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate. I will queue up for more questions. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks. Thank you, Yaron. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes. Let me just follow-up on that one. I noted today that California came out and, I guess, officially expanded presumption of coverage for employees there. So I'm assuming that your estimate actually included the expanded presumption of coverage for workers' compensation? Juan Andrade : No, it does not. So that\u2019s recent information, right? Look, our point of view on presumption of coverage is that it's something that needs to be taken very seriously obviously. Any broad sweeping presumption measures, frankly, can cause long-lasting harm to the industry and don't make a lot of sense for a number of reasons. Retroactively restructuring the underpinnings of the workers' compensation system to shift the burden of proof of cost to employers and their insurers really undermines the spirit of the workers' compensation system. And that's not something that companies have underwritten or priced for, and thus, it materially weakens the system. And so that is something that needs to be considered. It also violates well-established principles for workers' comp law that the claimant has the burden of proving his or her claim was a workplace injury and is a covered claim. And so that\u2019s the way we tend to view this, but our estimate does not include an expansion of presumption at this point in time. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question, we were given this stat on another call this morning about the percent of the exposure to personal lines or homeowners-type businesses versus commercial lines within the property cat book. By client, do you have a -- could you provide us with that breakdown? Juan Andrade : Thanks, Ryan. Let me ask John Doucette to jump in and help me answer that question. John Doucette : Yes. Good morning, Ryan and hope you\u2019re doing well. Look, that's a -- we write $6.5 billion of premium around the world, a good chunk of that\u2019s property. It's going to vary all over the place. By territory, within property, we write quota share per risk and catastrophe. And there's a mix, and it will vary within region in the U.S. as well. So there's no simple answer to that. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then my other one, I guess, is trying to think about -- I guess what I'm trying to think about is if there is like a second wave later in the year, whether or not that would constitute a second event. So maybe trying to get some clarification. I'm not sure how to ask the question, but some clarification on, like, what would a conservative reading be of the end of this as an event from a reinsurance standpoint? Like what conservatively would, I guess, close the book on the losses associated with this first lockdown? Juan Andrade : Yes. Ryan, this is Juan. Let me jump in there, and I will ask John to supplement my answer. I think this is where you come back to my comments that this is not a follow-the-fortunes event for Everest, right? When you start looking at event definition, including hours clauses, limiting duration of an event, outlining the radius or the contiguous environment that\u2019s involved, this is where all of that is going to come in into play for us, right? And so John, maybe you can more specifically answer that also. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. And I think it's important to point out that not only is the event going on, but we have rolling inception dates that are happening all the time. And we just finished 4/1s. We had some 5/1s in the U.S., May 1. Florida is coming up June 1. And in July, we\u2019ve a lot of renewals kind of all over the world, and facultative is ongoing throughout the year, many times a year. We have inceptions. And one of the things to point out that I think is important is that we are pursuing terms and conditions that help narrow or exclude pandemic risk. And that will ripple into some of the things you're saying about the go-forward. And that will help mitigate, limit or exclude the potential losses going forward. And we're certainly not alone doing that. Other -- while we're leading the charge, many other reinsurers are doing it as well. And I think that will help narrow whatever the scope of this turns out to be. But there's a lot of economic facts and things to come in terms of -- to answer your question better than that. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : We next go with Meyer Shields. Meyer Shields : Can you hear me? Juan Andrade : Yes, Meyer, we can hear you. Meyer Shields : Okay, great. Good morning. I have a question on business interruption. I'm hoping you can explain the position and maybe the reserving stance on the question of whether commercial property policies that don't include a virus exclusion but require direct physical damage, is it Everest's position that, that is still an absolute event, or are there some reserves that -- or some reserves that you established for that? Juan Andrade : Yes. No, Meyer. So this is Juan. Look, I think as I said in my opening remarks, we absolutely believe that physical damage absolutely is unambiguous in the coverage of this, right? If you think about it, there's double triggers, right? Number one, there has to be covered physical damage, which, again I believe is pretty unambiguous in the wording. And secondly, we also have virus exclusions on the portfolio. So I think that's the other trigger. So the answer would be yes to your question, do we believe it would hold? Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you. The second question, I was just hoping that given the comments that Craig had made about moving up the credit quality curve since the end of the quarter, can you give a sense as to new money rates? Juan Andrade : Sure. Craig, can you take that, please? Craig? Operator : Craig maybe on mute. Craig Howie : Thank you. Sorry. Meyer, I saw on your -- or I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our new money rate for the investment-grade portfolio was about 2.7% on average for the quarter. What we did see was due to some of the widening of the credit spreads and some of the actions that we took in the quarter, we actually saw better rates in March than we did for the overall quarter. So they were higher and closer to the 2.9% range. On average, we saw -- across investment-grade and some below investment-grade, we saw a purchase yield of about 3.2% for the quarter. Meyer Shields : Okay. That covers April in essence as well? Craig Howie : I'm sorry, I didn't hear that? Meyer Shields : Yes, I was wondering whether that covers the sort of April yield as well. Craig Howie : Well, the April yield is probably -- as I said to you, it's closer to the 2.7% on the investment-grade portfolio. And then some of the high yield that we are seeing so far is still over 5%. Meyer Shields : Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much. Craig Howie : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. My first question, going back on the business interruption and COVID discussion and just on the reinsurance side, I recognize -- I think someone else asked about the commercial versus personal breakdowns as well. Maybe you can give us those percentages, but is there a way for you to give us a high level view of what policies could be at risk in terms of accounts that have virus exclusions so they don't -- just as we kind of think about this being an ongoing event and what additional losses would come to Everest on the catastrophe reinsurance side? Juan Andrade : Sure, Elyse. And this is Juan and let me start off with that. Look, I mean this is still obviously a fluid and ongoing event. And we put a pretty thorough process in place in the first quarter that, as I mentioned in my remarks, is ongoing as far as how we're going to be able to continue to refine the estimates as we go-forward. On the reinsurance side, that basically involved spending time with clients, brokers, essentially looking at some of the underlying contracts, etcetera, to be able to get a handle on that. And what we know is that the underlying business that we're protecting, the vast majority of that requires physical damage before providing any cover on the business interruption side of things. And also in the U.S. specifically, most of the underlying policies in those portfolios that we're protecting also will include the virus exclusion. But let me turn it over for John Doucette to give you maybe a bit more additional color on that. John Doucette : Yes. I would -- I don't really have that much to add. As we've said, we're also -- our top down bottom up review, we looked internally, externally, talked to a whole lot of brokers, clients looking at our -- not just our catastrophe book, but our contingency book just across all lines of business. We did a kind of first principles review of everything that helped us get to the number that we got to and, again, trying of factor in retentions, deductibles, hours clauses, radiuses, contracts, some on a named peril basis and other provisions that vary. And we -- again, we looked and -- across, did a very thorough review, had a lot of people looking at it and are comfortable, based on what we know today, that we\u2019ve put up a reasonable provision for that. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is on the retro side. If you could just give us a more update view of the pricing within that business. And then this is more specific to your outbound purchases. Would you guys look to potentially buy less retro and keep more business net? And can you just have a current view of the pricing that's going on in the retro market? Juan Andrade : Thank you. John, can you take that? John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. Yes, thanks, Elyse. Good question. And so retro is predominantly not exclusively January 1. A lot of it covers -- a very solid majority happen at January 1. And so we\u2019ve seen a few that have come up the summer off-cycle and do it at March, April, May, June. And I think -- so we\u2019ve seen increased pricing there. And I think that the alternative capital that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are seeing and hearing a lot of noise about redemptions and, again, frustrations with the losses and kind of a comparison to other places to deploy the capacity. So I think there is a lot of noise there that we think will continue for a while. And that will have a direct impact on the retro market. In terms of our hedges, we look at a whole suite of hedges and really try to build a holistic program that has different attachment points, different product types, different geographic coverages, different durations of how long they are in place. And as you will recall, we renewed our catastrophe bonds. We have almost $3 billion in catastrophe bonds in place. We renewed them in November, December. The ones that had expired, we bought lower down. And again, in hindsight, we are glad we took the capital that was available to us then, even though it had been a slight increase in rates. And those are multiyear deals, and they will be in place for the next several years. And because the pricing's already locked in, the cost of that capital, the cost of that or the rate change embedded in that on a go-forward basis is 0. We also have Logan, our strategic partner and continue -- Logan is about flat from January to now and continue to use that as a very important hedging mechanism. And the cost of that goes basically, Logan rides up and down with us as they take quota shares of different layers of and build -- we build portfolios for them where they help us hedge. We do buy traditional reinsurance in retro. We will remain pricing sensitive to using that as a form of hedge. And we also buy ILWs, and we've been in the ILW market since January, looking and buying up ILWs as another way for us to hedge. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Ron Bobman from Capital Returns. Please go ahead. Ron Bobman : Hi. Thanks a lot. Glad to hear everyone sounds well. I had two questions. One, trying to get some handle around sort of the reinsurance buying demand from the market. I guess that would be sort of directed to John principally. John, with primary property companies presumably having some affirmative BI exposure and losses and presumably some amount unknown, the sort of tail risk, whether it be sort of judicial decision, litigation-oriented, etcetera, and the unknown and significant amount of that, what should a primary company be thinking and sort of doing now, if at all, as far as buying additional reinsurance? And what I\u2019m really sort of thinking about is sort of third event cover if some amount from COVID is going to tap their first tower. John Doucette : Thanks. Appreciate the question. So look, we are seeing a lot of interesting things about demand out there. But I would broaden it beyond people are buying specifically for COVID. People are looking because it's been a bumpy few years for the industry. And I think people's view, whether it's wildfires, Japanese wind, different exposures that happen and the development that we saw, so I think that overall, there's a view of derisking and a lower risk appetite. And that was around and building before COVID. And I think that today, people will be looking not just to how do I protect against COVID, but how do I use reinsurance to help manage volatility in my earnings from typical covers, typical perils as well as consider more capital protection. So -- and I think -- so we are seeing demand from larger buyers. We are seeing demand from smaller ones that are rating-sensitive or have ratings pressure. And a lot of our clients had asset issues due to the impact of the COVID environment, which also drives reinsurance demand. Ron Bobman : Okay. Thanks. And then the $3 billion in cat bonds that you mentioned and then separately the ILWs, do those -- is pandemic a named peril that those -- the cat bonds and separately the ILWs would provide protection for? John Doucette : They -- both the ILWs and the catastrophe bond are named peril and a pandemic is not a named peril, I mean. Operator : Thank you. We have Yaron \u2026 Juan Andrade : One last -- I\u2019m sorry, one last comment I would add to Ron's question, too. If you're also thinking about Everest insurance, we also feel that we\u2019ve a very good reinsurance program that's in place with regard to all of this. So I just wanted to finish that thought. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs for a follow-up question. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Hey, thank you. I thought maybe I would move away from COVID questions. I noticed there was a little bit of an uptick in the accident year loss ratio in insurance. Can you maybe talk about what drove that? Juan Andrade : Yes. Sure thing, Yaron. This is Juan. I think as Craig mentioned also in his opening comments, when you look at the loss ratio for the quarter, very close or very stable to where we were at the end of the year. There is really a main driver on sort of the uptick, and that really has to do with mix. We saw a bit more growth in A&H, in casualty and in risk management. And those lines of business basically could carry higher loss picks than some of the other lines of business. So I would attribute it basically to the mix and the growth in those specific lines. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And is that mix also impacting part of the decline in the expense ratio year-over-year? Juan Andrade : The expense ratio exactly, that was primarily on the commission side of things where because we did write some more risk management business, etcetera, you also had a mitigating effect on that. So that would be correct. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thanks so much. Juan Andrade : Sure. Thanks, Yaron. Operator : Thank you. It appears that we have no more questions in the private -- in the question queue. [Operator Instructions] Jon Levenson : Nadia, pardon, I think we are done with questions. And we would like to hand the call back over to Juan for some closing comments. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you, Jon, and thank you for everyone today. And again, as I said, I\u2019m glad that everyone seems to be doing okay. Look, as far as just some quick summary remarks, over the years, our company has built a reputation for strong operating performance with a strong capital position built to withstand catastrophes. And while no one could have predicted an event of this magnitude, we do stand ready to serve our customers and our brokers, and we will have the strength and stability that they will have come to rely on us over the last five decades. So we will keep refining our estimates, and we will keep working on this, but we will also be there for our customers as they need us. Thank you for your time. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Levenson. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Thank you, Cody, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance Division. We're also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplements. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. The world is struggling with the greatest public health threat in the last century, which has resulted in economic and great personal suffering. At the same time, individuals are rightly calling for positive social change and seeking an end to racism and inequality. At Everest, we stand together with our colleagues around the world against racism and discrimination. We have an unwavering commitment to supporting diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace. In the context of this public health, economic and social environment, Everest is serving our customers and providing the strength and stability that they have come to rely on for almost 5 decades. Our business is running smoothly. We are performing well, and our people continue to demonstrate the passion and resilience that differentiates Everest. The health and safety of our employees and our customers are paramount. I am very proud of our team and very thankful for their hard work and perseverance in delivering the solid results we're reporting today for the second quarter and for the first half of 2020. Our ability to leverage our capital position, our global platform and our success in executing against our objectives, even under adverse conditions, positions us very well for continued profitable growth. We have strong and broad-based forward momentum across both our Reinsurance and Insurance divisions. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, resulting from our strong financial ratings, deep distribution and diverse portfolio as well as increased rate levels and high retention rates. We sequentially improved our underwriting profitability in the second quarter, and we continue to demonstrate strong structural expense management discipline. Our industry-leading expense ratio continues to give us operating flexibility. We also reported significantly improved net income compared to the first quarter as we benefited from the upswing in the capital markets during the second quarter. And our shareholders' equity grew to a record $9.3 billion as of June 30. Our book value per share was $232.32, up 8% from the first quarter of 2020 and up 4% compared to year-end 2019. Our excess capital position remains a source of strength, as evidenced by A+ financial strength ratings recently affirmed with stable outlooks. Everest has the capital to play offense in this market. If we were to identify a need for additional capital, our low debt ratio gives us high degree of flexibility. Our capital position, our focus on execution, our people and our emphasis on solving problems for our customers keep us well positioned to pursue all business opportunities that meet our underwriting appetite. Before I specifically address our second quarter results, let me share how we're driving the company forward. Our focus is on sustainably growing a balanced and diversified insurance and reinsurance portfolio by line of business and geography through the relentless execution of our strategies to deliver consistent underwriting profitability. We are nimble. We are opportunistic. We are capturing current market conditions that meet our return requirements. On the revenue side, this is about creating greater optionality and diversification across our entire business. With a broad mix of products, customer segments, distribution and selective local presence, we're capitalizing on growth opportunities around the world and balancing the highs and lows of our industry and economic cycles. This is why having vibrant reinsurance and insurance businesses is a key element of our strategy. The growth of the Insurance division, with gross written premiums now exceeding $3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis with sustained attritional profitability, is vital to greater balance in the organization. But this growth is not at the expense of our Reinsurance division. Today, we are a top 10 global reinsurer, a growing specialty insurer, and we are building on these positions in this market. As a group, we are playing offense to improve and further solidify our position with the best mix of talent, product and services. We are enhancing and sharpening the strategy and tightening the execution and operating rhythms. We are deploying our sizable balance sheet and diverse capital base to expand our relevance in our chosen markets. On the margin side, the focus is on underwriting profit. We are maintaining and enhancing our underwriting results with active portfolio management, strong risk governance and excellent analytics. We are reducing exposure in areas not meeting the right risk-return profile, and we're dynamically deploying that capital to areas that do. Our strategic utilization of alternative capital will enable us to further diversify the portfolio. We are focused on claims management to deliver consistently accurate outcomes with superior service. We are maintaining our expense leadership through more efficient and scalable operating models enabled by the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and natural language processing tools. On investments, we continue to generate strong cash flows that are invested in conservative, high credit quality portfolios. We remain well diversified. All of this will deliver growth in earnings over time, resulting in book value per share growth. Turning to the second quarter of 2020. We demonstrated continued momentum across the group with 11% growth in gross written premiums, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The growth was broad-based across both our reinsurance and insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 11% and 10%, respectively, also excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to benefit from improved insurance and reinsurance market conditions during the quarter, which I will discuss in a moment. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic impacts, our IBNR loss provision and a small amount of associated credit impacts, our attritional combined ratios for the group at 88.5% and each of our segments, Reinsurance at 86.7% and Insurance at 93.7%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of this franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. On a 6-month year-to-date basis, Everest has grown 15% and delivered an 89.1% attritional combined ratio, excluding pandemic impacts. Our Reinsurance segment had strong growth for the quarter. We continued to successfully execute our strategies to underwrite a high-performing book of business with higher economic returns at the important April 1, June 1 and July 1 renewals. We continue to see excellent reinsurance opportunities in several areas such as facultative risk, property and in certain territories including the U.S., Canada, Latin America and Asia. This environment gives us the opportunity to better shape our book toward deals with better terms and pricing and walk away from others that do not meet our pricing hurdles. Traditional capital from highly rated carriers like Everest has become more relevant, and supply is tight, particularly given the more limited availability of alternative capital. We see this favorable pricing environment continuing for the foreseeable future, even with pandemic-related economic headwinds. Reinsurance profitability was also strong for the division, with a 95.3% combined ratio, including COVID impacts, and an 86.7% excluding the COVID impact. John Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions. Our Insurance segment's growth remained strong for the quarter at 10% and with improvement in underlying performance. The attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impacts, improved to 93.7% for the quarter compared to a 96% in the second quarter of 2019. We are strategically managing the insurance portfolio to build a more diversified business and steer our mix towards product lines that we expect to earn higher margins long term. The maturation of several new product lines launched over the last several years as well as our wide market footprint give us access to significant opportunities. For the quarter, the main insurance growth drivers were : strong and widespread rate momentum excluding workers' comp of plus 18%, and including workers' compensation of over plus 12%. This is the highest overall rate change we have seen in a long time. Insurance written rate also continues to exceed loss trend across our core P&C lines of business. We also saw continued strength in the excess and surplus line space. We had strong renewal retention in both our retail and E&S businesses. But this growth is offset by pandemic-related headwinds and lines heavily impacted by lower payrolls and lower business activity. Turning to investments. Net investment income decreased to $38 million for the second quarter. The drop was attributable to negative returns from our limited partnerships, which, as we mentioned in our first quarter call, report on a 1 quarter lag. Given the lag, this drop reflects the market turmoil, which occurred in March. The second quarter recovery in the public markets provides a basis for expecting an improvement in limited partnerships, which will be reported in the third quarter. The amount of the recovery is difficult to predict given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19 impacts, as per our July 23 announcement, we have taken $160 million loss provision in the second quarter made up substantially of IBNR. The majority of this loss provision, $130 million, was for the reinsurance business. These losses relate to event cancellation or postponement, business interruption and workers' compensation. We have also increased our IBNR for allocated loss adjustment expenses based on anticipated cost to investigate and defend some portion of claims. We are taking a measured approach to our loss estimation process that is based on credible and supportable information. This is an ongoing event and very different than a natural catastrophe. We're continuously monitoring this evolving situation and recognizing potential exposure based on the most up-to-date information available. Our second quarter estimate was based on a refreshed analysis updated with the latest information from our clients. While our analysis continues to include all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate does not take into account legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. Of the $30 million loss provision for the second quarter in our specialty insurance business, the majority was from event cancellation and postponement policies as the nature and duration of the pandemic has increased the likelihood of cancellations into early 2021. A smaller portion of the insurance loss provision was predominantly loss adjustment expenses for business interruption policies. As stated last quarter, our property policies have unambiguous policy language that requires direct physical loss for business interruption coverage to be triggered. Additionally, the majority of the property policies in force contain a virus exclusion. Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sublimits that would offer BI coverage for a notifiable human disease. These exposures have already been recognized as part of the overall IBNR estimate. Workers' compensation represents the smallest portion of the insurance provision in the quarter. We have refreshed our analysis based on the industry profile for businesses which have now been deemed essential by many states. However, this is not a significant amount. Our portfolio has no known exposure to first responders and very minimal exposure to frontline health care workers. With regard to the reinsurance loss provision, we have updated our analysis based on information from cedents and brokers. It is important to reiterate that as a reinsurer, our analysis will be very fact specific to each situation and each contract. We have also updated our review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. Based on our current view of the macroeconomic situation, updated client information and our internal modeling, we remain comfortable with our exposure and with our loss reserves. We will continue evaluating this business as the economic situation unfolds. In summary, Everest continues to gain traction and forward momentum despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and the rapidly changing external environment. We're operating smoothly with the health and safety of our employees and their families top of mind. I am optimistic about our future. We have a talented team, a global platform and a strong capital position, which allows us to capture the improving opportunities in front of us. Lastly, I want to welcome Mike Karmilowicz to the call today. As you saw in our recent announcement, I am pleased to introduce Mike as the new CEO of our Insurance division. Mike's promotion is an acknowledgment of the key role he played in the growth of the insurance business over the past several years and provides continuity so Everest can execute on our winning strategy. He will be available to answer your questions today. Now let me turn it over to Craig to provide additional details on the financials. Craig Howie : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest delivered another solid quarter of financial results. For the second quarter of 2020, Everest reported net income of $191 million. This compares to net income of $17 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $333 million for the second quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $207 million compared to $687 million for the first half of 2019. Net income included $22 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $100 million of capital gains in the first half of 2019. These results were driven by a strong underwriting performance across the group, stable investment income from fixed maturities and low catastrophe losses, partially offset by a COVID-19 pandemic loss estimate of $310 million and negative limited partnership investment returns. The overall underwriting gain for the group was $51 million for the second quarter and $80 million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $393 million in the first half of last year. The company continues to grow premium in 2020. Year-to-date gross written premium was $4.9 billion, up $646 million or 15% compared to the first 6 months of 2019. This reflects growth in both segments, with Insurance up 20% and Reinsurance up 13% compared to last year. In the second quarter of 2020, the company reported $15 million of catastrophe losses related to the civil unrest in the U.S. Although there were a number of loss events in the quarter, notably U.S. storm events, none of these events breached our $10 million catastrophe threshold, and as such, are included in our attritional loss estimates. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $45 million compared to $55 million during the first half of 2019. The group combined ratio was 98.1% through the first 6 months compared to 95.5% for the full year of 2019. Excluding the catastrophe losses and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable combined ratios were 89.1% through the first 6 months of 2020 and 88.4% for the full year of 2019, mostly attributable to business mix changes that impact the attritional loss ratio. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio was 16.7%, up from 16.2% for the full year 2019, primarily due to the continued change in reinsurance business mix. For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.0%, up from 58.2% for the full year 2019. This increase was related to the continued shift toward more pro rata business, which requires a higher loss pick, but allows us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. Pro rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earn into our results as we let the loss pick season over time. For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the impacts from the pandemic, was 65.4%, down compared to 66.0% for the full year 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 22.4% was down compared to the prior year due to the business mix and more ceding commission received in the Insurance segment. Group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% in the second quarter and 6.1% for the first half of 2020, in line with our expectations. During the second quarter, we saw reduced expenses for new hires, travel, entertainment and conferences. On loss reserves, we completed several reserve studies during the quarter related to some smaller classes of business. The overall indications were not material enough to warrant any action on these studies during the second quarter. For investments, pretax investment income was $186 million year-to-date on our $21.6 billion investment portfolio. As Juan mentioned in his remarks, investment income in the second quarter was impacted by $88 million of limited partnership losses. The fixed income portfolio remained stable and produced $272 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $253 million for the same period last year. The pretax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was 3.4%, stable compared to 3.4% one year ago. We've been able to maintain a consistent yield to maturity without a dramatic shift in the overall investment portfolio. We expect to maintain our asset allocation and a conservative, well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with conservative duration. For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter. Other income and expense included $24 million of foreign exchange losses during the first 6 months of 2020. On income taxes, the year-to-date tax benefit of $14 million included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act that we reported in the first quarter. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 11%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full year. Positive cash flow continues with record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $854 million in 2019. This increase reflects our growth in premiums and a lower level of catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019. Shareholders' equity for the group was $9.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, a new record for Everest, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The increase in shareholders' equity in the first half of 2020 is primarily attributable to the $207 million of net income and a significant recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio. A mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets improved from an unrealized loss of $248 million in the first quarter to an unrealized gain of $545 million in the second quarter of 2020. Everest continues to maintain a very strong capital position, with industry low debt leverage and high liquidity in our investment portfolio. Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the Reinsurance operations. John Doucette : Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Having now finished our June and July renewals, we are increasingly optimistic about the reinsurance market and our position as a global provider of reinsurance solutions. The flight to quality by reinsurance buyers continues. And highly rated reinsurers like Everest, with solid financial strength and global underwriting capabilities, will do well in this market. The expanded opportunity set allowed us to improve our portfolio across virtually all geographies and classes of business. As Juan stated earlier, Everest's market positioning, combined with healthier market conditions, led to strong growth in gross written premiums for this quarter and for the first half of this year. For net written premium, the growth was even higher at 15% for the second quarter as we retain more business given our capital strength, the improved underwriting environment and the shifting economics of retrocession purchases. Overall, we have a larger and more profitable portfolio than we did last year. By many measures of risk and return, the expected performance of writings this year is improved versus the expected performance of the last underwriting year. Our portfolio's growth has been broad-based with significant contributions from our global facultative operations, which are seeing large increases in submission activity and strong pricing trends. Encouragingly, rates are increasing strongly even in markets with sufficient capacity. In terms of property cat, market conditions overall remained strong, particularly in peak zones and recently loss-affected areas. Cat renewals in Florida and the U.S. generally experienced double-digit rate increases with higher increases on loss-affected business, leading to higher expected margins and profits. In our Florida cat book, we wrote more premium versus last year, but with less exposed limit. As a result of our underwriting execution and rate increases, our expected dollar margin for Florida is meaningfully higher. We also refocused our capacity on fewer core clients. Regarding our global property portfolio, we executed our plan. Expected profits grew considerably as we retained more economics due to a smaller outwards retro spend. However, we maintained hedging capacity through Mt. Logan in our catastrophe bonds. Across our peak cat exposures, our net PMLs increased midyear relative to January's net PMLs, reflecting our plan to capture this market's improved profitability. The net PML increases are predominantly further in the tale of the distribution. Competition from ILS capacity was less pronounced during the midyear renewals due to investor frustration from multiple bad industry cat loss years, adverse development and trapped capital by several ILS managers. The retro market is favorable for sellers. And as a net seller of retro, we captured strong double-digit rate increases. And demand from recurring retro buyers remains robust. We also deployed more capacity in property pro rata business with original rate improvement and tighter occurrence caps. The well-priced cat exposure of this class contributed somewhat to the increased PML. The casualty reinsurance markets are also improving directly from increased excess rates or indirectly as original business rates benefit pro rata deals. Excess casualty rate increases generally range from single digits to well into double digits, varying by ceding and product. Casualty ceding commissions improved slightly. While the casualty market improved, we still walked away from some large renewals priced below our return requirements. Nevertheless, we have several compelling opportunities to partner with our global clients in several classes of business, either through new deals brought to the market or increased shares on improved renewals. In Australia and Asia, market firming continued throughout the year with earlier renewal rates increasing less than later renewal rates. For these midyear renewals, more business met our return hurdles, and we wrote more premium accordingly. Our long-term relationships in Asia cultivated over the last 30-plus years allowed us to capture better opportunities and in times like these, those situations become more pronounced. Likewise, quality underwriting opportunities presented themselves in Canada as rate increases were achieved across several different lines of business in both fac and treaty. Therefore, we have been increasing our shares on several Canadian programs. Finally, some comments on our mortgage book. We remain comfortable with our exposure, loss picks and loss reserves on our mortgage writings. The majority of our in-force mortgage business will not be impaired by the pandemic unless housing fundamentals and post-economic recovery, unemployment deteriorate significantly. This is in part because of our generally high attachment points and our conservative underwriting and pricing of mortgage. Also, unlike the primary mortgage insurers, we, as a reinsurer, can and do book significant IBNR reserves. In summary, disruptions facing our industry and our personal lives create uncertainty around the future of many businesses and economic sectors. As a leading provider of reinsurance solutions, we maintain a strong position to absorb volatility and diversify that uncertainty for our clients with our robust balance sheet, global presence, and capital resources, while generating solid returns for our shareholders. Thank you. And now I will turn it back over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thanks, John. I feel good about the direction of the insurance and the reinsurance market, and I am pleased with our execution and our momentum. We have grown our premium by 15% in the first 6 months of 2020. Our first priority is to profitably deploy our capital for organic business growth in this hardening market environment. We continue to find ways to put our capital to work, and we see strong opportunities ahead. Now let me turn it over to Jon Levenson to open it up for your questions. Jon Levenson : Great. Thanks, Juan. Cody, I see we have a number of participants in queue. Can you please open the Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first take our question from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : First question. I appreciate all the color regarding the COVID losses that were booked. Curious, we get a lot of questions from investors about how to think about the COVID impact going forward. And I know it's complex, given a lot of your losses are coming through the Reinsurance division. But in regards to your conversations with cedents, do you - are some of them thinking that there's likely to be more losses trickling in during the back half of the year as this very complex situation is further assessed? Or some insurers, I think, mostly primary issuers are trying to say that they think they kind of have most of their loss picks on booked, unless things get materially worse regarding COVID? Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike, this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think we have a very solid estimate based on what we know today. We have a good process that has underlined the estimates really from the beginning of this crisis, and we certainly talked about it in the last call. All that being said, this event is still underway, right? The crisis is still ongoing. And much of this is going to be determined by the length of this crisis, as well as by any actions that are taken by governments along the way. So I think in that sense, there is some uncertainty as to where the losses, particularly on the reinsurance side, may go as cedents are still trying to grapple with their own numbers and essentially come up to a good estimate. But again, I would say, from my perspective, we do have a solid estimate based on what we know. And that certainly has been the approach and the perspective that we have taken from the very beginning. And as we have more updated information, we will be updating that as well. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Great. My last follow-up question is regarding your outlier low leverage level. And I think we appreciate that you guys are playing offense. Clearly, you can see it. PMLs came up a little bit, but still kind of well below historical levels. You're seeing certain participants in the industry either raise debt, equity, new startups. So has your thought process changed in terms of the opportunity cost of holding a lot of excess capital? Is it changing or is it kind of plan A is still is just let's keep kind of trying to grow the top line in excess of our ROE, less the dividend and we'll just kind of use up our excess over the coming 3, 5 years that way? Juan Andrade : Yes. So let me start, and then I would ask Craig Howie to jump in as well. Mike, what I would say is our capital management philosophy hasn't changed. I start out with the fact that we have more than ample capital to deal and face off with the opportunities that are in this market today. And I think you see it from our numbers, right, that we've been very forward-leaning and being able to continue to grow in this environment. We also have a very low debt leverage, right? So as I mentioned in my remarks, to the extent that we see any opportunities that are relevant for us, that are accretive for us, at that point in time, we have the flexibility to increase our capital. But as I sit here today, look, I feel very good about our capital position. We also have over $13 billion in deployable capacity, right? When you think about our policyholder surplus plus what we hold in our bonds, what we hold in Mt. Logan, et cetera, et cetera, we have plenty of capacity to work with in this market. So from that perspective, our philosophy continues to deploy capital into this market, particularly given the favorable conditions that we're seeing right now. But Craig, is there anything you would add? Craig Howie : Juan, I think you covered it. I do think that, just to state the obvious, that if we did want to build our balance sheet, we have sufficient low leverage and certainly one of the lowest debt leverages in the industry to be able to do so. Michael Zaremski : And so would you - if you had to put more capital to work, are you leaning more towards reinsurance in the near term or primary insurance to deploy that - the access? Juan Andrade : Yes. It's a great question. Fortunately, we're in a pretty good position, right, in the sense that you don't have to choose which of your children you like most. We see opportunities on both sides, right? And so I think as I articulated and John Doucette had articulated, we're seeing some really good opportunities on the facultative risk side, some very good opportunities in property as well. All of that being said, you also heard from John that we're being very disciplined. So if things do not meet our economic return criteria, we will walk away from it just like what we did at some of the recent renewals. But we see plenty of opportunity to deploy capital there. The same thing in insurance. You saw the growth rate there. We see great opportunities in property, both wholesale and retail. We see very good opportunities in excess casualty. We see very good opportunities in D&O. So right now, because of our capital base, we are looking at where we can play offense in this market and deploying our capital that way, so we can grow and essentially take advantage of the favorable conditions. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : So I saw you took the PMLs up, of course, and following on what Mike was saying. Is there any change in the cat load guidance? And if we think about next year, if things go the way you want them to go, where would you ideally want to be setting your PML and your cat load guidance? What is a healthy market and a healthy PML in an attractive market for cat protection? Juan Andrade : Yes. So Josh, this is Juan. So for this year, there is no change in our cat load from that perspective. But let me ask John Doucette to speak to the PMLs. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Josh, for the question. So as I mentioned in the script, we have seen opportunities. And as we put in the investor presentation, the PMLs are up now, Southeast wind is 7% of equity, up from 5.7%. And really, it's going to be a function of the - of what we see in the market. We expect - we like Florida, but we were disciplined. We did shed some clients and nonperforming accounts that didn't meet our return thresholds. And that was true at July 1 as well, and we expect it to be true at 1/1. So we do expect to see momentum continuing into 1/1 and beyond. We think it's a great market to be a seller of retro. We are a top 2 seller of retro among rated reinsurers. And as Juan alluded to, we have the capital across the Kilimanjaro bonds, Logan and, of course, our common equity and debt - have the capital and flexibility to write the book that we see that's in front of us and what the market gives to us. But we do expect to see robust demand in 1/1 and going forward. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And then a little education in casualty pro rata risk. If I may cede and I have a pool of risk that I'm raising prices on and I think improving margins on. When I negotiate a treaty with a reinsurer to protect me from some of that business, because maybe I need balance sheet protection or let's just say balance sheet is just not big enough. I'm going to say, look, our business is going to be more profitable next year, so we're going to raise the ceding commissions on you. To what extent, I mean, is there a ceiling on how much profitability you can receive in a rising rate environment for risk if it's sort of tempered by the ceding commissions being charged for improving profitability on that same risk? John Doucette : Yes. That's a great question. And I think first principles. That's why we're agnostic to the form that we take in reinsurance risk, whether that's casualty, property, specialty and mortgage. We look at it across - we look at it as to how we want to deploy capital, and that will vary by product. And likewise, our clients will look to see whether they want to do things on a proportional basis, an excess basis, excess or loss per risk basis. And that varies. Some of them will change that over time. But that's why in my statement, in my comments, I mentioned that the casualty market we're seeing improving, but we're seeing a little bit of improvement in ceding commissions given the market that we're in. But we are seeing a lot more of the benefit coming through the original, the primary rates on the insurance operation. So - and then also, I think it's - we need to remember that there are a whole lot of clients out there that write their business using different capital levels. And some have capital - a lot of capital support that, that gives them flexibility, whether they do something potentially on a pro rata basis or an excess basis. But then a lot of our clients around the world, again, they don't have a lot of capital. And so sometimes they need to de-lever their premium. And so they do need to buy proportional treaties. And that's in the U.S., that's international, that's in Lloyd's, where it will vary, again, by line of business. And that gives us the opportunity by having the ability to dynamically allocate capital by line, by territory and by product, excess loss or pro rata, it gives us the best chance to capture what we see as the opportunity in front of us profitably. Operator : We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : I guess first question. I do want to go back to the capital raise question. It sounds like the environment is a very constructive one, and you see it probably with legs going into '21. So does the decision to not raise capital today - I'm just trying to understand how that fits in to this construct. Do you not see sufficient opportunities to deploy capital that you would raise? Is the market not attractive enough? I guess at what point - what would make you want to raise capital that you're not seeing today? Juan Andrade : Sure, Yaron. So thank you for the question. This is Juan. Look, so number one, I would start with the fact that for us, this is a dynamic process, right? We're always sort of assessing our capital, our needs, the environment, that sort of thing. So it's not a fixed point in time. It's a very dynamic discussion that we have within the company. We find the current opportunities to be quite attractive. And hopefully, you saw that from, frankly, the bullish nature of my comments and those of John Doucette on this call. I think you see that from the growth rates and how we're managing to execute on the opportunities that we see in this market. But our position right now is, look, I mean, where we sit with the capital that we have right now, we feel that we have more than enough to be on offense in this marketplace. Unlike others who have had to raise capital for defensive purposes, we're not in that situation, right? We're actually in a good place right now. Now I did say in my remarks that this environment is very fluid. And if we identify opportunities that we see that are accretive to our bottom line, then we certainly have the flexibility to be able to do that. Again, I would have like Craig to see if he's got any additional thoughts on that. Craig Howie : Yes, Juan, I agree. If you're going to raise capital, it should be accretive. And certainly, timing comes into play as well. If you're raising equity capital, certainly, earlier in the year was a good time to do it instead of waiting toward election times. But we didn't need to raise equity capital. We didn't need to build scale. We already have the scale. We're not trying to fund M&A at this point in time, and we're not trying to replace retro coverage at this point in time. So certainly, as the market changes, we still have flexibility, especially with respect to our debt leverage. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And my second question, with regards to Reinsurance COVID losses, can you maybe explain what the difference is between being fact-specific to each situation in each contract as opposed to following the fortune? Like what's the distinction that you're making? Juan Andrade : Yes, Yaron, happy to talk about that. Look, every contract is going to be different, right? I think unlike a natural catastrophe, there's going to be hours clauses, there's going to be bench definitions, there's going to be different attachment points, et cetera. And so that's really when we say that, that's what we mean, is that this is not a panacea, and we're going to look at each contract by its nature, by its merits, by its own facts. And then we will make claims adjudication decisions based on that. Yaron Kinar : And that's not the same as following the fortune? Juan Andrade : Well, I think following the fortunes would imply that essentially, any loss that you're seeing to report as being a COVID loss would be automatically accepted. And essentially, what I'm saying - what we're saying as a company is it's very fact specific, and that will be put against the contractual requirements and wording in each of our contracts. Operator : We'll then move on to our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Sorry, I also have a question to follow-up on the capital side of things. Is there a way that you can tell us like, I know you pointed to, right, that you have your own common equity, Logan as well as Kilimanjaro, that help support increased writing, cedings into what seems like a really strong market in 2021? But can you give us a sense on your current capital base, right, assuming on more increased deleverage, which sounds like you're holding off on that for the time being? How much growth could Everest absorb on its own capital base today in 2021? Juan Andrade : Sure. I would ask Craig Howie to answer that. Craig Howie : Well, Elyse, it depends on which capital measure you're looking at. And right now, we feel as though we can grow both sides of our book, both reinsurance and insurance, with the capital base that we have today. And that even goes into looking forward to 1/1 renewals on a reinsurance basis. So that's why we feel as though given the market and given where we are today, that we have enough capital to not miss out on any opportunities in the current market conditions. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, on the leverage side, obviously, you guys have pointed out, you're underlevered relative to your peers. Is there a certain internal mark that you guys are viewing to go to? And then I guess, in that answer, how high would the rating agencies let you take your leverage? And can you also provide with an updated AUM for Logan? I'm not sure if you guys provided that earlier. Juan Andrade : Craig? Craig Howie : Yes. So Elyse, with respect to our leverage, certainly, from a rating agency perspective, what they're doing currently right now is allowing people to increase their current leverage. As you know, we're closer to 6%. We could have easily grown that capital to 20% leverage without any question or concern at all. Most of our peers are in the 20% and upwards of 30% range, as you well know. So from that standpoint, we have plenty of room to grow and expand that leverage. As far as the Logan AUM question, our Logan AUM was - we were able to grow the AUM slightly this quarter, but it is down from year-end. We're at about $800 million. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : So I'm actually interested in John Doucette's perspective, because I would think, look - John, looking at Slide 15, if that slide would be driving you nuts, because you've been here - you've been at Everest for years. And in '15, '16, '17, '18, the PML was double digits and pricing was a lot worse. And common sense says, if you want your PMLs to be better or higher when pricing is better and now, they're only at 7%. So I guess the question is like, what's the lesson here? Was it too high back again? Or are you more in the camp of I'm chomping at the bit to deploy more capital at this moment because this is when you really want to be quite a bit higher in terms of PMLs? John Doucette : Yes. Ryan, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. So what we've been saying for a while is that we want to - we're not just a one-trick pony within property. And if you rewind the tape, property - our view, the property was more attractive on a relative basis than some other lines, and you talked about being more bearish on casualty than some of our competitors. So what we've seen, a couple of things. We have seen property - improvement in property prices. We've also seen improvement in casualty. As you know, we've been growing out our mortgage book substantially. We're seeing nice increases and opportunities in specialty lines business. And so we're deploying more capacity along the way there. And really, I think what we're trying to do is capture what we see as the opportunity in front of us. We've also talked about on prior calls kind of an elevated risk that we've seen in a social - when you think about social inflation and things in Florida tied to like assignment of benefits and climate change and other risks that also have caused us to make sure that we're deploying what we view as the right amount of capacity fill combination. And so that elevated the return requirements that we needed to deploy increased capacity. And again, our view as to where are we head into 1/1, we expect to see a robust January 1, particularly in peak zone cat and retro. And we'll deploy capacity accordingly. So we'll do it, but we'll also be - we'll do it based on what the market terms and conditions are, what the clients' demands are, but we'll also be looking across all lines of business and territories to really build the best book we can. Ryan Tunis : And then just one follow-up for Juan on the insurance side. You said in the press release that pricing is exceeding loss trend. We're seeing modest improvement of the underlying combined ratio in that business. It's probably not arithmetically what you think it would be, given the level of rate we're getting. So I guess, how would you describe, I guess, the cadence and the pace of margin improvement we're seeing in insurance relative to the amount of rate. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Ryan. Look, what I would say is we are definitely seeing loss trend being essentially below our written price change, right? So we're seeing a lot more rate right now ahead of trend. And that's a good thing. That being said though, we are also keeping our loss picks up and conservative given the environment in all of this, right? So while you're seeing rate ahead of loss trend, and frankly, you're seeing some frequency benefit on some lines of business, at this point in time, we think it's just prudent to maintain the loss picks where they are. And so over time, you will see that margin improvement. And so that's basically how we're looking at that. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : I want to start with Juan, I guess, basic question. I know it's way too early to have an estimate for losses from the Beirut explosion. But how should we think about that impacting various insurance and reinsurance markets? Juan Andrade : I'm sorry, Meyer. I didn't hear the first part of your question. Meyer Shields : I'm trying to get a sense in terms of directionally. When you got something like the Beirut explosion, obviously, far too early for any estimate of losses, but should we think of this as an insurance event, a reinsurance event? Juan Andrade : Got it. So if we're looking at Beirut specifically, I think, as you pointed out, look, it's probably too early to tell. We are a global company, and I would expect that we will have some loss out of that. I would expect the loss, if it comes, it will be more on the reinsurance side than on the primary insurance side, at least for ours. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's very helpful. I'm getting a couple of questions about the modest adverse reserve development in the Insurance segment. I was hoping that either Juan or Craig could comment on that maybe. Juan Andrade : Yes, sure. This is Juan, Meyer. Would be happy to talk to you about that. Number one, it's very small, right? So it's less than $5 million. And it's really an increase on a specific large loss that came through in the quarter in our international insurance operations. So it's not meaningful from that perspective. And as you know, our reserving philosophy has been that we react quickly to that news. And frankly, we felt it prudent to recognize in this quarter and we recognized the development. Meyer Shields : Okay. So if this was an actual loss emergence instead of this happening. Okay. And then final question, and I know quarterly numbers again bounce around a lot, but the - within insurance, the other specialty line was down year-over-year. Is that a more economically sensitive line than some of the other specialty lines? Juan Andrade : Yes. And let me ask Mike Karm to jump in and give you a little bit of color on that as well. So Mike? Michael Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks for the question. That actually is definitely an economic impact. That business usually is transactional risk, which is M&A, which is obviously impacted by the COVID and the pandemic and then other lines on the credit side. So some of those actions, we actually were deliberate in actually slowing that business down, given what's going on with the pandemic and its impact to the credit markets. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple here. Juan, I just want to clarify. I think you said in your response to Ryan's question that you didn't take any frequency benefit in the quarter either on comp or short-term property lines in the Insurance segment? Juan Andrade : Yes. So that's correct, Brian. We are not taking any frequency benefit in the quarter for any of the lines of business where we have seen lower frequency so far this year. At this point in time, we think that's premature. And the reason for that is pretty straightforward. While you do see claims counts down in some lines of business like commercial auto and workers' comp and in GL, exposures are also down, which also result in premium refunds, right? So the impact on severity is less clear yet. And so I think you really need to look at longer-term averages because some of these frequency decreases may be temporary, and we don't know what the bounce back is going to be once the economy is fully reopen. Brian Meredith : Got it. That makes sense. And I guess I'll just add on to that. I'm just curious, Juan. Could you give your perspective on kind of what social inflation kind of currently looks like? And what your outlook is here as the economy reopens? And with respect to that, is there anything that you can do right now with contract awards in your insurance space to potentially mitigate COVID-19 related claims here going forward? Juan Andrade : Yes. No, absolutely. This is something that, frankly, we have been all over from the very beginning of this crisis. And I give a lot of credit to our corporate underwriting teams and our chief underwriting officers on that. Look, this is consistent with what I just said about frequency. I think as the economy begins to reopen again, a lot of the trend indicators that were there prior to the pandemic that frankly gave rise to some of the rate increases that we're seeing now across the board are still going to be there, right? So that hasn't gone away. But we have taken a number of actions, whether it's been pushing rate, tightening terms and conditions, reviewing contract wordings. We've also been putting pandemic exclusions in place across the board. We've also withdrawn capacity from certain territories, certain products, certain lines of business that, frankly, we weren't comfortable with as far as the risk assessment or the coverage that was being granted. And as you just asked on the earlier question regarding other specialty and insurance, we're also remaining cautious on certain economically sensitive lines. So we've taken a pretty deep and thoughtful approach to our underwriting from the very beginning of this pandemic in order to provide protection to the book going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Philip Stefano : Yes. I was hoping you could talk about the reserving process for the COVID charges on the insurance business. And I think, Juan, you had mentioned in your opening remarks that there are some events into 2021 that are contemplated. So maybe you could just give us a flavor for kind of the time line and how you're thinking about reserving there. Juan Andrade : Yes, absolutely. Look, I would tell you that the estimate that we have on the insurance side is a solid estimate, as I mentioned before. Particularly for event cancellation type policies, we are looking at early 2021 at this point in time. And this goes back to one of the questions I was asked earlier about the nature of this event. And what I mentioned, which, look, this is an ongoing event, and a lot of this will depend on the length and shape of it, frankly. But on contingency, we're definitely looking at early 2021 at this point in time. Philip Stefano : And so the reason I'm asking the follow-up then leads to the reinsurance side of that. I'm getting the impression on these calls first quarter and probably even more so second quarter that auditors are having a different feel for how far they're allowing people to look in their reserving process. I guess, on the reinsurance book, when you have conversations with students, is the horizon they're allowed to contemplate in any way complicating your ability to reserve on the reinsurance side? How are those conversations going? And is the time line you're contemplating a reinsurance really different than the insurance side of your book? Juan Andrade : Yes. So let me give you my thoughts on that, and then I would ask John Doucette to jump in as well. So look, I think the process has been very similar from the perspective of the detailed discussions that we've been having with our cedents, we've been having with brokers trying to understand the book of business. Obviously, the difference being that in the reinsurance side, it's a much more global book. We have some very large cedents and they're still trying to grapple in some ways, as you've seen in a lot of the calls, with their own exposure. And so from that perspective, on the reinsurance side, we do get a bit of a lag as far as the information is concerned with some of this information. But I think as far as the time horizon is concerned, our conversations with the cedents have been - they're looking at similar time frames through the end of this year, beginning of next year. But John, I don't know if you would like to add some color to that also. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. And as you said, there clearly is an information lag in terms of when the reinsurers hear things, plus everybody has to go look at the contracts in terms of how - again, going back to contract specific, fact specific, what are the retention clauses. What were the retentions? What are the hours clauses? What are other terms and conditions, exclusions that are in the contract? And I think that just takes a while to understand. And our clients - again, it varies by territory, what the original wording is. And so there's a lot of moving parts that really result in this as well as, as we've said, this being an ongoing event, that it makes it a lot more complicated. But we feel comfortable, based on all the information we have today, with both the process that we put in place to identify as well as what we have booked, again, given the information we have today. Juan Andrade : Yes. And the last thing that I would add to that is, remember, the assessments we have out there are really management's best estimate. And what the auditors will review is really the approach on how management essentially achieve those estimates. Operator : We'll take a follow-up from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : Great. Just two quick follow-ups. Any California wildfire subrogation benefits this quarter expected? And also, just wanted to confirm regarding the mortgage insurance book, I believe you said that losses weren't booked unless the situation deteriorates or did you say that there was some IBNR put up, but you don't expect kind of losses unless things deteriorate? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me start off with mortgage first, and then I'll ask Craig to talk about the subrogation question. We have not put up any estimates for mortgage because we don't think we need to. We think our loss estimates, and we think our reserves are fine, more than adequate at this point in time. So we have not put up anything for the mortgage book. Craig? Craig Howie : With respect to the California wildfire subrogation, first of all, on the reinsurance side, we'll see a lag in reporting from our cedents on that. The PG&E settlement just happened this quarter. So it will take some time before it gets reported to us. On the insurance side, we don't expect much subrogation at all since we had very few losses related to the California wildfires in our Insurance segment. Michael Zaremski : Okay. So from the reinsurance, can you kind of look at what the - you can see what your losses were and just expect a certain percentage of that to potentially come back in the coming quarters? Juan Andrade : Go ahead, Craig. Craig Howie : It depends on each season, and it depends on each contract that we have with them and how much coverage we have with them. And then they will report back to us depending on what their settlement was out of the PG&E settlement. John Doucette : Yes. This is John. I just wanted to add. So it very much is a function of what was their gross wildfire loss and then where do their reinsurance - what is the attachment point and the limits. So some of it, it could meaningfully impact their ceded losses. In some cases, it could have no impact on their ceded losses. So we're really in a wait and see, as Craig said, waiting to see what the settlement, if any, was and what they report as the benefit to the reinsurers. And when and if they do that, we'll book that into our numbers. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Josh Shanker again with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : This is probably easy, and probably not. I want to say. Can you tell us anything about the insurance or reinsurance markets in Lebanon, given the news last week and how we might want to think about that? Juan Andrade : Good question. I'll ask maybe John Doucette to start on the reinsurance side. John Doucette : Yes. So I mean, again, very early days. It's a small market, and we're looking at what the - first, we're looking at what the coverages are that are offered in the region. So far, some of the brokers have come back with some modest coverages that are there. And really, we're still - it's too early to tell in terms of what the ripple effect is, both for the building, the specific building that was at risk, but then also the broader - the territory, the neighborhood that was impacted around that. So frankly, we're looking at it, but it's a relatively small market. Joshua Shanker : And is your exposure in line with your global market share? John Doucette : We're still assessing that. We don't have - we certainly would expect it to be, but it does vary by territory, but we don't have any reason to think it wouldn't be. Juan Andrade : I think it would be helpful to add that indigenous exposure would be de minimis, right? I think any exposure for the company really would be out of global treaties from global cedents, that sort of thing. John Doucette : Correct. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to continuing the discussions next quarter. But before I let you go, just echo what I said earlier. We feel very good about where Everest stands right now. We feel very good about our traction, our momentum and our ability to execute in this market. So thank you for your support, for your questions, and I hope you stay safe. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Everest Re Group Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on the Everest website later today. I now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Jon Levenson : Good morning and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are : Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. For nearly 50 years, Everest has been a source of strength for our customers. This has never been more important than in today's public health, economic, social and natural catastrophe-impacted environment. Our business is running smoothly. We're performing well. And our people continue to demonstrate the passion, professionalism and resilience that differentiates Everest. I am thankful to our employees for their hard work and perseverance in delivering the solid results we're reporting today. I am particularly proud of Everest recently being named by Business Insurance as one of the best places to work in 2020, a meaningful achievement in the current environment. The economic recovery is uneven and there was significant natural catastrophe activity in the quarter. Despite this, Everest has continued to grow and generate operating profit. Our broadly diversified Reinsurance and Insurance franchise, our financial strength, deep distribution relationships, and our focus on providing solutions to our customers represent the foundation that position us well for the strength we see in the reinsurance and insurance markets today. In addition, we have added 2 exceptionally talented and seasoned global executives to our management team. Mark Kociancic, our new Group Chief Financial Officer, joins us from SCOR, where he was the group CFO since 2013. Jim Williamson, our new Group Chief Operating Officer, joins us from Chubb. Both of these executives have made an immediate impact to Everest. I want to thank Craig Howie for his commitment and contributions to the company. Craig has played an important role in the growth and evolution of Everest. Craig will remain with the company until the end of 2020 to assist Mark with a smooth and seamless transition. We have also further fortified our already strong capital base with $1 billion senior notes offering completed on October 7. This is very efficient long-term 30-year capital at a low 3.5% coupon. As I said in the second quarter earnings call, we have the capital to play offense in this improving market, and we also have capital flexibility. We chose to exercise some of this flexibility opportunistically, given the state of credit markets and the low borrowing rates available. We will seek to deploy these proceeds as favorable market opportunities continue to develop and in support of our overall strategy to grow book value over time. Our already strong company is now even stronger. Everest's strength is evidenced by our third quarter results for the group, where despite the high frequency of natural catastrophe activity, we achieved 16% gross written premium growth and improved attritional combined ratio of 85.8%, excluding cat and pandemic impacts, net investment income of $234 million, operating income profit of $97 million, net income of $243 million, book value per share growth of 7% from yearend 2019 or 9% adjusted for dividends, and a record shareholders' equity of $9.6 billion. Our growth in the quarter stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved rate levels and high retention rates on our existing book. The underwriting loss for the quarter was driven by the previously announced $300 million in catastrophe losses. This is in the context of an estimated $35 billion industry loss in the third quarter. We also added $125 million to our COVID-19 loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our prudent reserving philosophy. This provision is predominantly IBNR. Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic impacts, our attritional combined ratios for the group in each of our segments, Reinsurance at 83% and Insurance at 94% improved year-over-year and are reflective of the earnings generating power of the Everest franchise. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. On a 9-month year-to-date basis, Everest has grown 15% and delivered an 88% attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impacts. Everest Reinsurance had 20% quarterly growth year-over-year. We executed our strategies to underwrite a high-performing book of business with higher economic returns and lower volatility. We executed on reinsurance opportunities in several classes, including facultative risk, property and casualty, and in certain territories, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Traditional capital from highly rated carriers like Everest has become more relevant and supply is tight. We see the favorable pricing environment continuing for the foreseeable future. We also continue to be disciplined and rigorously evaluate each transaction. John Doucette is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. Everest Insurance had solid execution in the quarter with continued underlying margin improvement over 2019 and 6% growth year-over-year, despite exposure reductions in certain lines given the current economic environment. The attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impact improved to 94% for the quarter compared to 96% in the third quarter of 2019. We are strategically managing the Insurance portfolio to build a more diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher margins over the long term. Our significant position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. For the quarter, the main insurance growth drivers were continued rate momentum of plus 19% excluding workers' compensation, and plus 13% including workers' compensation. We had strong growth across property, excess casualty and D&O, where market capacity is constrained and we are seeing the strongest rate increases and better terms. We had continued strength in the excess and surplus line space. And we also had strong renewal retention in both our retail and E&S businesses. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. Regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the $125 million loss provision in the third quarter was comprised of $110 million for Reinsurance and $15 million for Insurance. Our overall COVID-19 loss provision year-to-date is $435 million, of which 85% is IBNR. Consistent with our analytical rigor, we continue to take a measured approach to our COVID-19 loss estimation that is based on credible, fact-based and supportable information. We instituted a thorough loss estimation process at the start of the pandemic. It is conducted team by team and contract by contract. As events unfold and more data becomes available, we are continuously testing our estimates. The claims data we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. It is also important to reiterate that as a reinsurer, our analysis is specific to each situation. And similar to reserving, we have established an equally prudent and rigorous claims process. We evaluate claims presented based on existing policy, and contract terms and conditions. Lastly, we remain comfortable with the exposure and loss reserves in our Mortgage business in the context of the ongoing economic uncertainty from the pandemic. In summary, Everest continued to perform well in the third quarter, despite the uncertainty in the world today. We continue to purposely seek the best opportunities to write business at attractive returns. We have a talented team, a diversified global platform and a strong capital position. All of which allows us to provide attractive solutions to our clients and capture the improving opportunities in front of us. Now, let me welcome Mark Kociancic to the call and turn it over to him for additional details on the financials. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I am very excited to be joining the great team here at Everest with its excellent talent base and culture. I look forward to contributing to the company's continuing growth and success. I think my industry experience and skill sets will be assets to further augment the great foundation that has been built here at Everest. Everest delivered a strong set of financial results for the third quarter of 2020. We achieved significant net income and positive operating income, continued our growth into favorable market conditions and strengthened our already robust capital position. For the third quarter of 2020, Everest reported strong net income of $243 million. This is more than double the $104 million of net income for the third quarter of 2019. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $451 million compared to $792 million for the first 9 months of 2019. Year-to-date, net income included $67 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $90 million in the first 9 months of 2019. Third quarter results were driven by strong premium growth across the group, strong investment income performance and improved attritional loss and combined ratios. We also had Q3 catastrophe activity of $300 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. And we added $125 million COVID-19 pandemic loss provision; year-to-date, our COVID-19 provision stands at $435 million. And as Juan stated, it's predominantly IBNR. The group experienced an underwriting loss in Q3 of $150 million due to the elevated level of natural catastrophes in the quarter as compared to an underwriting loss of $28 million in 2019. Turning to Everest's market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $7.7 billion, up $1 billion or 15% compared to the first 3 quarters of 2019. This reflects balanced and diversified growth in both segments, with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to last year. During the third quarter of 2020, the company reported $300 million of catastrophe losses. These losses are pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums and related to Hurricanes Laura, Isaias, Sally; wildfires in California and Oregon; and other events including the Midwest United States Derecho windstorm. The after-tax basis amount was approximately $240 million. On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax and net of reinstatement catastrophe losses of $345 million compared to $335 million during the first 9 months of 2019. Excluding, the catastrophe losses and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable combined ratios were 85.8% for Q3 2020 and 87.1% for Q3 2019, an 88% through the first 9 months of 2020 and 87.7% for the first 9 months of 2019, mostly attributable to the Reinsurance business mix changes. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the third quarter of 2020 was 59.3%, down from 59.7% compared to Q3 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the first 9 months of 2020 was 60.2%, up from 59.5% for the first 9 months of 2019, primarily due to the continued change in Reinsurance business mix year-over-year. For the Reinsurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 57.5%, essentially flat from 57.6% in Q3 2019. Year-to-date, it stood at 58.5%, excluding the pandemic loss, up from 57.5% for the first 9 months of 2019. This increase was related to the continued shift toward more pro rata business, which carries a higher loss pick versus excess of loss, but allows us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. The Reinsurance division has $323 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $294 million of year-to-date net investment income. For the Insurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the impacts from the pandemic, was 64.8%, down from 65.9% in Q3 2019. Year-to-date, it stood at 65.2%, down compared to 65.6% for the first 9 months of 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low-90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The Insurance division has $62 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $126 million of year-to-date net investment income. The Q3 group commission ratio of 20.2% was down compared to the prior year Q3 level of 23.3%. This was driven by business mix and Reinsurance, notably more facultative business written and earned, and also higher ceding commission received in the Insurance segment. The group commission ratio of 21.7% year-to-date was down compared to the prior year figure of 23%, largely due to the same reasoning. The group expense ratio remains low at 6.1% for the first 9 months of 2020, in line with our expectations. Q3 investment income increased strongly to $234 million versus $181 million for Q3 2019. For investments, pre-tax investment income was $420 million year-to-date as compared to $501 million for the first 9 months of 2019. The fixed income portfolio generated $408 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $383 million for the same period last year. As expected, net investment income increased substantially as we recorded $89 million quarter-to-date of largely fair market value adjustments of our limited partnership investments in this line. The limited partnership result was due to the impact of improvement in the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. The pre-tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was 3.1%, diminishing from 3.4% one year ago. We continue to hold a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with conservative duration at approximately 3.5 years. The current overall fixed income reinvestment yields are averaging approximately 2%. Other income and expense included $38 million of foreign exchange gains during the first 9 months of 2020 compared to a loss of $44 million for 2019. Regarding income taxes, our effective tax rate on operating income was minus 0.1% through Q3. There is a year-to-date tax benefit of $31 million related to the CARES Act that we reported in the first quarter. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on year-to-date operating income would be 8.9%. Along with growth and profitability, positive cash flow was a highlight this quarter as we generated record operating cash flows of approximately $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $633 million in Q3 2019, reflecting the strength of the growth in premiums in 2020 compared to 2019. Everest has a strong balance sheet, which was endorsed by the market with our very attractively received debt raise during October. Everest solidified its very strong capital position in the aforementioned opportunistic $1 billion senior notes offering in early October with a low coupon of 3.5% and 30-year tenure under very favorable market conditions. This represents very efficient long-term capital for Everest. The debt leverage ratio pro forma for Q3 stands at 15.1%. Shareholders' equity for the group was $9.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. The increase in shareholders' equity in the first 9 months of 2020 is largely due to the $451 million of net income; the mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets, which increased by $349 million from December 31, 2019 plus $387 million of paid dividends and share buybacks. Net book value per share stood at $239.98, up 7% from yearend 2019 or plus 9.3% when adjusted for dividends. Again, I'm very excited about the future of Everest and the opportunity to further help drive its performance off a strong base. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it back to Jon. Jon Levenson : Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. And we would ask if everyone can please limit their questions to 2, 1 question plus 1 follow-up. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. Good morning. My first question, just looking for a little bit more color on the margin profile within, I guess, Insurance and Reinsurance. So you guys are getting a good amount of rate in both of those businesses, showing some good growth as well. So I'm just trying to understand just the level of margin improvement. I know we saw some in the quarter when we backed out cat and the impact of the pandemic. But I'm just trying to think about the impact of earned rate exceeding trend and how we should think about the margin, the potential for expansion in both Reinsurance and Insurance for the balance of this year and into 2021. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan Andrade. Yeah and as you note, we saw good margin improvement in the quarter. And just to add a little bit of context for that, we are seeing that rate is outpacing our loss trend in most classes of business, particularly in the insurance sector, also in reinsurance. But we are not changing our accident year loss picks at this point in time. We believe, again, based on our prudent reserving philosophy that we need to let some of the season over time before we actually start taking it to the bottom line. However though, keep in mind that we also have other levers that we can pull in order to improve margin and improve profitability in our book of business. And it's things like portfolio management, always looking at your portfolio in detail, being able to tweak that. We could look at deal structures. We could look at limit deployment. We could look at industry class selection, terms and conditions, et cetera. So from that perspective, we're doing all of that in our goal to continue to improve underwriting profitability for both the Insurance and the Reinsurance segments. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up, I guess, just tied to that, was there any benefit from COVID in the accident year loss ratio? Just I'm thinking if there was any kind of frequency benefit within workers' comp or some short-tail lines that you took in the quarter? Or did you not take any of that within your results? Juan Andrade : No, we did not take any frequency benefit into account in our results. We are seeing frequency benefits in certain lines of business, commercial auto, general liability, workers' compensation, et cetera. But keep in mind, there's also exposure reductions that are taking place at the same time, because of economic situation. And so, similar to my reply to the earlier question, we're looking at this and we're taking a wait-and-see approach before we change any of our loss picks or bake in any frequency benefits at this point in time. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Hi, can you hear me? Juan Andrade : We can hear you, Yaron. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Good morning. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Good morning. Yaron Kinar : So, first question is with regards to the COVID losses. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what lines of business those reserves were put up in? Juan Andrade : Yeah, sure thing, Yaron. The lines of business were contingency, business interruption and a little bit of workers' compensation as well. And I would point, again, back to my remarks and remind you that, again, the vast majority of that provision was really in Reinsurance, which is about $110 million of the $125 million. And overall, 85% of our provision at this point year-to-date is on an IBNR basis. So I think that gives you a sense for, again, the prudent approach that we're taking on this. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And have you booked, I guess, in contingency and BI, have you booked those at full limit losses today or is there potential for additional losses to come? Juan Andrade : Yeah. The way I think about it, and I'd point you back to my remarks, Yaron, we have a pretty detailed and rigorous process by which we're estimating our reserves that is based on credible and fact-based information. So given that, what we're doing is essentially looking at the fact that this is an ongoing event. It's continuing. I mean you're certainly seeing the situation in Europe these days with some of the additional lockdowns and the spikes, et cetera. So from that perspective, it's an ongoing event. And so, what we do is we do a bottom-up, treaty by treaty, account by account, profit-center by profit-center type review and we true it up with the latest information that we have available at the time. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then my follow-up question is with regards to the reserve beyond COVID. You're still relatively new in the role, less than one year in, there's new CFO now as well. We haven't really seen much movement in reserves this year. As we head into the end of the year, how confident is the management team in the current reserves? Juan Andrade : Yeah, sure thing. So, Yaron, what I would say is, we have an ongoing and dynamic process to review our reserves. And our philosophy hasn't changed. It's really what we have talked about in the past in the sense that we recognize bad news quickly. And we require good news to be proven over a longer period of time. And hence, that was a little bit also of my answer to Elyse earlier about accident year loss picks. We need to see some of that season over time. But we're always continuing to review and analyze the portfolio. We have completed some reserve studies in smaller segments earlier in the year, and there was no material change in either direction. We will be completing longer-tail segments in the fourth quarter. And if we see any need to take action, we will take action at that point in time. But again, that's basically the reserving stance in our philosophy. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Brian Meredith with UBS Securities. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions here. The first one, just on the Reinsurance space, I noticed a drop in casualty XOL and casualty pro rata premiums. I thought that was actually a pretty good market now. What's going on there? Just contracts lost, certain unusual items going on? Or is your conscious reason to decrease that? Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian. I'll ask John Doucette to please comment on that. John Doucette : Yeah, good morning, Brian. Look, part of that is just timing of accounts and a couple of one-off accounts. But we agree that it's a good market, and we're seeing both on the treaty and the facultative side proportional casualty and excess of loss casualty opportunities both in the U.S. and international. And we had a very good July 1, and continue to see that. And frankly, expect that to be an area of growth for us in 2021. Brian Meredith : Great. And then pivoting over to the Insurance, kind of similar type question. I mean only 5% growth in premium this quarter. I know some of that's probably the pressures from workers' comp. But maybe some color around why are we seeing better growth there? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Mike Karmilowicz, if you can answer that question, please? Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks, Brian, for the question. A couple of things. Juan stated before that our focus is really in the business with a better margin long-term, as you just mentioned with workers' comp and our diversification. You're seeing that business mix play through the underlying loss ratio. And with that, we are focused with the front foot of capitalizing those markets where we are prepared to drive. So when you think about like excess casualty, you think about D&O and even our core U.S. retail and wholesale property where we're up 28%, we're driving those groups really hard. Now there is a drag a little bit that you're seeing with regards to the pandemic, but we are very well positioned. And given the opportunity in the marketplace that's in front of us, we think we're going to have significant opportunity in the foreseeable future as the economy comes online. Juan Andrade : Yeah. And what I would add to that, Brian, as well, is that we're executing pretty well and we have the platform, both on the E&S side and the retail side. You saw the plus 19% rate that we had in the quarter, which is continuing to build over prior quarters. And when you take away some of the drag from the exposure reductions that you're seeing in the economy, this business will grow double digits. And that's just a matter of the economic recovery playing itself through. Brian Meredith : Great, very helpful. Thank you, Juan. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Good morning. Thinking about the capital raise, I guess from hearing the comments on previous earnings calls, it didn't seem like capital was really needed. I heard the comments, Juan, about being opportunistic. So just curious, did something kind of change quarter-over-quarter? Or is it just simply low debt costs and some growth? And do - will some of this capital be used for buybacks, if the buybacks, you think, will come online now that COVID losses seem to be kind of improving, and we're through most of cat season? Juan Andrade : Yeah, thanks, Mike. So first of all, nothing has changed. We have been in an excess capital position as a company, as we've talked about in the past. And for us, it was exactly what I said, it was really opportunistic timing, given where credit markets were. I mean, look, the fact that we printed a 3.5% coupon on 30-year debt is pretty good. I think it's probably one of the lowest, if not some - the lowest P&C long-term debt coupon that's been printed out there. So the timing, it was really the key for the markets where yields were at the time. That was really the key that drove all of this. Now as far as what we'll do with that capital, again, we were starting in an excess capital position, we're now in an even stronger capital position, we have flexibility. As I indicated in my remarks, we see some very, very good opportunities right now organically in both the Insurance and Reinsurance space, given the market conditions. So that's part of it. But we're also thinking, as I said in my remarks, about playing this in support of our overall strategy to grow book value, right. So there's different things that we can do over time with this capital. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Understood. And that would include share buybacks potentially reopening, Juan? Juan Andrade : It could in the future, right. I mean if you look at our capital management philosophy, our first priority has always been to deploy capital for organic business growth in the market. We see attractive opportunities there. Beyond that excess capital can also be used for other things, share repurchases, pay dividends, et cetera, et cetera. So there's multiple things that we can do there. And that's really my comment about supporting growth in book value over time. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Great. And last question was a follow-up to Yaron's question about kind of reserve studies. Do you - is there any - do you think that the new management team coming onboard, there might be a change to kind of the reserving philosophy as you guys take kind of a new sets of eyes kind of look at the book, I think - versus one that historically you've thrown up just a little bit of reserve releases. Some of your peers tend to kind of just book a little bit more conservatively. Just curious if you think if there could be any changes there. Thanks. Juan Andrade : Yeah. Thanks Mike. Look, keep in mind, I think, as Yaron said, I've been the CEO for less than a year at this point in time, right, it's been about 10 months. Mark Kociancic is now joining us. But as I stated earlier, in the response to his question, the fundamental philosophy of recognizing bad news quickly and requiring good news to be proven over a longer period of time really has not changed from that perspective. So I go back to the fact that I'm a fact-based guy. We will look at the information that comes out of our reserve studies and then we will act accordingly. Michael Zaremski : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. First question to Mark, if I can. You mentioned I think that insurance ceding commissions were up and that was helping the expense ratio in that segment. I guess it was a little surprising. My impression is that ceding commissions are generally coming down as one of the aspects of the hard market. I was hoping you could add some color to what's going on there? Mark Kociancic : Yeah, Brian. Meyer Shields : Meyer. Mark Kociancic : Meyer, sorry about that. Yes, the ceding commissions what we're seeing in the Insurance space is an elevated level of ceded premium really due to the business mix of what we have. And so we're ceding a bit more business out in certain lines, which is leading to higher ceding commissions coming in there, but that's more of a business mix situation. Juan Andrade : Yeah, so it's not so much a change in the percentage for the actual ceding commission, but rather the business mix that's flowing through. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's very helpful. The second question, I guess, earlier this week, we had one of the Bermuda reinsurers talk about being more conservative in their interpretation of potential catastrophes than vendor models. And I was hoping if you could talk about how Everest sees that. Juan Andrade : Yeah, thanks, Meyer. This is Juan. Look, I think climate change is a real thing, right. It would be crazy to deny that climate change exists. You know I'm also acutely aware that our industry plays a critical role, frankly, in the economic and social recovery after extreme weather events. And you look at what's been happening, particularly in the Gulf Coast. And frankly, my heart goes out to these people having spent a lot of time in my career working and living down there. The frequency of activity that's hit them in the past quarter is just not good. From the perspective of how we think about it, I think modeling is a big part of it and we certainly have a really world-class modeling capability that looks at everything from sea temperatures to atmospheric saturation to changes in economic valuations, and we look at all of that. However, what I would say is, though, no single computer model is going to be able to predict consistently the long-term impact of climate change. So this is when you have to really come back to the skill set that your underwriters bring and the underwriting judgment that we have. And so from our perspective, that's part of how you have seen some of our PMLs reduce over time, right, the fact that we're looking to grow a diversified book of business to be able to manage that type of volatility even better. And the other thing that I would say is you look at our hedging, right. The fact that we do pretty significant risk transfer to our third-party capital tools like Kilimanjaro, Mt. Logan, et cetera, and that's part of the suite of how we think about all of this. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of context on how we think about it, Meyer. Meyer Shields : It does. Thanks so much. Juan Andrade : Thank you. Operator : Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan, your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Sorry, I was on mute. Sorry about that. Can you hear me, Juan? Juan Andrade : Yeah, Ryan, I can hear you. Good morning. Ryan Tunis : Sorry about that. Yeah, good morning. So yeah, you said you've been here 10 months. So you're pretty familiar with Everest now, some management changes. I guess just taking a step back, a broad question. As you think about 2021, what are the main parts of Everest that you think need to get better? And what are you thinking, like, some of the main improvements might be? Juan Andrade : Yeah, it's a good question. Look, I start with the fact that I think we have a great company and a great culture. And frankly, based on the numbers that you see us continue to report, we're attacking this environment, right. The pricing is there, the execution is there. So I feel pretty good about all of that. We certainly have strengthened the management team with two executives who have global capabilities, who have a lot of strategic strength, and I feel very, very good about that. Look, I think for us, the opportunity is how do you continue to execute in the middle of all of this, right. The context of a pandemic, the context of an economic recession, and the context of a very strong underwriting market. So for me, those are good problems to have, which is how do you continue to take a great franchise and move it forward in that environment and do it successfully. Ryan Tunis : That's helpful. And then my follow-up, I guess, just for John Doucette. The $300 million of cats seems like a lot less than maybe what Everest might have had in past years. I don't know if that's how you're thinking about it or not. But I'm just curious if - what's your observation on cat experience this third quarter versus maybe what you would have had in a similar type of cat year in 2018 or 2019? How does that reflect some of the changes you made in the book? John Doucette : Yeah, thanks, Ryan. Good morning. And - so a couple of things. So as we've talked about on prior earnings calls, you break it into a couple of parts, you break it into wildfire. So we had talked about how we didn't think the industry was charging enough what we thought was required for the elevated risk for the wildfires. And so we pushed rates, terms, conditions and irrespective of getting a lot of improvements. We also decided, made a conscious decision to cut our wild - our gross wildfire exposure. And then on the - on some of the property and the wind-exposed areas, yes, we've been seeing a lot of rate, but we also talked about a view of an elevated risk, a combination of the climate change that Juan talked about before, but also seeing social inflation, things like Assignment of Benefits, and how that impacts things. And so, that along with exposure growth, and just frankly, our increased cost of capital, because our ability to deploy capital profitably into many other lines of business, and we expect to be doing that going into 1-1. As we see improving rates terms and conditions, our cost to deploy property ag has continued to go up, cat capacity. So that certainly was helpful in terms of our market share and absolute dollars of loss. But, frankly, that wasn't an accident, this was all intentional. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : Josh Shanker with Bank of America, your line is open. Joshua Shanker : Yeah, good morning, everybody. Juan Andrade : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Shanker : I wanted to talk a little bit in relation to Meyer's question about ceding commissions, but on the Reinsurance side. Obviously, it's a very good quarter in terms of the commission expense ratio, the best since 3Q 2017. I've been looking at the mix of business. It seems like quota share casualty went down, and it doesn't seem like there was a lot of ceding commissions from the events. Maybe you can walk through that number a little bit and give us some thoughts on how it might compare with where it might be in 2021. Juan Andrade : Yeah, so John Doucette, maybe you can provide some color on that? John Doucette : Yeah. Thank you. Good question. So I mean part of it is mix of business, but part of it also, I think, there was also a commutation we had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that had to do with prior year that kind of had an offset between what was on the commission side and the loss reserve. So it was kind of a push financially, but it did move some of the numbers around. And I think that's part of what you're seeing. So - and then in terms of what we would expect going forward? We would encourage you to look at the year-to-date numbers for what the commission ratio as a better indicator than any one quarter. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And then, if we're thinking about business mix going forward, orientation for 2021 between XOL versus pro rata, between property versus casualty, do you have any preview on how you think you might orient the book coming next year? John Doucette : Yeah, it's a great question. We spend a lot of time thinking about that, strategizing about it with our underwriters all over the world. So look, I mean the bottom line is we're pretty bullish on many opportunities across many lines of business going into 1-1. And there's a variety of reasons for that. We're seeing the flight to quality and a flight back to the traditional model, which we think will greatly benefit us across many lines. Our global clients are continuing to want to buy more and buy more from people like Everest. So that's a significant opportunity. And then, whether it's property or casualty or specialty, marine and aviation, political risk, trade, credit or surety, I mean we have underwriting expertise in all of these lines of business all over the world. And so, we are ready, we get the team. We have the capital as one. And Mark talked about. We have the franchise, the distribution. And we're really leaning forward. And then, in terms of where it will be, we see opportunities in all of those. We expect the casualty market, partially because the reinsurance panels, the security requirements on reinsurance panels for our long-tail business, casualty professional, that's hard for a lot of people to get access to that business. So we have the distribution and the relationships and, again, the underwriting expertise. So we expect to see a strong 2021 when it comes to the long-tail. But, of course, we're looking at the most dislocated property retro market we've seen in 15, 20 years. And so, again, we'll look to deploy capacity and capital. And then, we spend a lot of time, and we've talked about this before, kind of dynamic capital allocation, not just between short-tail, long-tail, but then within each of the respective areas; what's the best territory, what's the best product, structure that we want to deploy. And so, it's hard to know how that will all settle out. But rest assured, we are bullish about the opportunity presented to us and our ability to execute it going into 1-1. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very much for the answers John Doucette : You are welcome. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back over to the Everest team for final remarks. Juan Andrade : Thank you. And thank you for your time today. I think as you've heard from us, Everest is well positioned for this market. We have the financial strength. We have a preferred market presence. We have a diversified global platform. We're very nimble. So we can go either way and take advantage of the opportunities. We have a deep distribution set of relationships. We have great people. And we have a great culture. So we do feel pretty good about the market environment and the situation that Everest is positioned on to capture. Thank you for your time today and we look forward to updating you at the next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Jon Levenson : Good morning and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd 2020 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today\u2019s call are : Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today\u2019s call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Juan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2020 had its share of global challenges that COVID-19 leads any discussion of the year. The pandemic affected all our communities, our way of life, and resulted in an unimaginable death toll. It affected all aspects of the world\u2019s economies, including the insurance and re-insurance industry. Despite unprecedented challenges and through the resilience and dedication of our team, Everest delivered solid 2020 results with excellent growth and improved underlying profitability. Key steps we took last year include adding to our deep and talented management team, strengthening our balance sheet, enhancing our enterprise risk management and operational discipline, and further diversifying our business. Most importantly, we have been a valued partner to our distributors and customers during a very perilous time. With a strong foundation in place, we remain confident in continued operational and financial success across our business. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the Insurance segment while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a global and leading P&C reinsurer. As we think about our positioning in the market, amongst our clients, partners and investors, we are guided by the following principles, by which Everest will seize opportunities and increase the value of our company. First, we will deliver superior growth in book value per share over the cycle. Second, we are an underwriting company. One of our core competencies is the identification, underwriting, pricing and management of risk. Diversification by line of business and geography is critical. We have clearly defined and quantified risk appetite, and we maintain strong enterprise risk management and performance monitoring. Third, investment returns are a critical value driver and investment management is also a core competency. We are further optimizing our invested assets via portfolio management strategy that is complementary to our underwriting risk. With a sizable invested asset base and significant cash flow, we seek to add value and diversify the sources of income to the company. Fourth, we manage our capital to fuel long-term profitable growth while continuing to expand our third-party capital capabilities. And fifth, we will maintain our industry-leading financial strength. We complement our core strengths with a low-cost expense space in a flat entrepreneurial and responsible organization. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchise, financial strength, deep distribution relationships, and leading customer solutions enable our continued performance in today\u2019s market. We have robust momentum coming into 2021, and we are well positioned to continue diversifying our business for sustained profitable growth. I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance results starting with the fourth quarter followed by our full year 2020 and how these results position us well for 2021. Starting with group results. In the fourth quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 13% and net written premiums by 16% with strong growth across both segments. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved terms and conditions and rate levels, expanded shares on attractive renewals and high retention rates on our existing book. Our underlying combined ratio was 86.3%, a four point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 with both segments showing significant improvement in loss and expense ratios. Net investment income was very strong at $222 million compared to $146 million in the prior year quarter. For 2020, Everest grew gross written premiums 15% and net written premiums 17% year-over-year. We delivered $514 million in net income and $300 million in operating income, despite the COVID-19 loss provision, the prior year reserve strengthening and an active cat year. Our dividend adjusted book value per share grew over 11%. We are focused on delivering superior growth in book value per share over the market cycle. The underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 87.5% year-over-year with our Insurance segment, improving 2.3 points to 94.2%. Net investment income was in line with prior year despite the market volatility. These results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest in our ability to thrive in any market. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions, including managing attachment points, limits, terms and conditions, targeted non-renewals and many other actions. This is the hard work of building and sustaining a profitable book. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything that we do. As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we strengthened prior accident year reserves in our Reinsurance segment by $400 million. The reserve strengthening does not change our view of current accident year loss picks as we had already selected more conservative loss picks in response to general loss trends. We are confident in the prior year reserving actions we took in the quarter and the quality of the enforced portfolio. These decisive actions will serve as well. In the fourth quarter, we also added $76 million primarily for third-party lines to our COVID-19 loss provision. Despite a high frequency of storms in the fourth quarter, our manageable catastrophe losses of $70 million resulted from disciplined underwriting and the purposeful reduction of volatility over the last two years in our reinsurance portfolio. Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson are on this call and can provide more detail on these actions during Q&A. For our reinsurance division, the fourth quarter continued our strong growth. Gross written premiums grew 12% in the quarter and 15% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio X COVID was 83.9%, an improvement from 87.4% in the prior fourth quarter. January 1 is our largest renewal date and this one was one of the strongest in many years. The rate environment improved across most territories in lines of business with loss impacted business seeing material increases. Capacity is abundant, but reinsurers remained disciplined on pricing and terms and conditions. There is a flight to quality wherever strong balance sheet in highly rated financial strength set us apart. Customer and broker demand for Everest capacity is strong, as highlighted by our increased shares and preferential signings on treaties, counterparties actively want to do more business with Everest. Our responsiveness, ability to deploy significant capital, and reputation as problem solvers in the market, were critical to a successful renewal season. We saw outstanding results in Latin America, in the U.S. and Canada, as well as meaningful growth in Continental Europe. We had notable wins on large deals and increased our share with core customers and in territories and classes; we found the most attractive including facultative business. We continued to expand and diversify the portfolio as we execute to achieve a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. Specific to our January 1 property book, total limit outstanding increased with an increase in rate online and significant improvements in the combined ratio, ROE, risk adjusted return and increased dollars of expected margin. We have a stronger and more profitable portfolio. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our insurance division continued its solid execution, as evidenced by our results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020. Gross written premiums grew 15% or 18% excluding terminated programs, with gross written premium of $872 million in the quarter and over $3.2 billion for 2020. Both fourth quarter and full year 2020 revenues are milestones for the insurance division. This growth is driven by discipline cycle management, strong rate in target classes and improving activity in certain lines of business, such as transactional liability, that was partially offset by reductions in economically impacted areas such as energy, sports, leisure, and entertainment. Everest Insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 93.8% for the fourth quarter, a 4.3 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 and 94.2% for the full year 2020, a 2.3 point improvement over 2019. These results are driven by portfolio and expense management and are consistent with expanding insurance margins. We achieved record renewal rate increases of 21% in the fourth quarter, excluding workers\u2019 compensation and up 14% including workers\u2019 compensation, where we are seeing rates flat. Rate is outpacing our expected loss trend and renewal retention across the entire portfolio is strong. The rate we achieved as a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments are necessary and we expect they will continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, these increases are led by property, up 21%; excess casualty, up 50%; D&O, up 35% and commercial auto, up 17%. We are also seeing widespread increases in other lines of business, which has been slower to turn most notably general liability, now up 9%. we are managing the insurance portfolio to build a diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher long-term margins. Our position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. We have a vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance business with experienced teams, providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. building on the achievements of 2020, we will continue diversifying our business for profitable growth and sustain momentum throughout 2021. The company is on solid ground with excellent financial strength ratings, top talent, and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified mix of business and superior risk adjusted returns. The relentless execution of our strategies results in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident that Everest future and on our ability to deliver the commitments to our customers, shareholders and the marketplace. 2020 showed us all just how resilient we truly are. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan discussed in our pre-release outline, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4 improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent capital position. I\u2019ll touch on these over the next few minutes. The positive quarterly net income result was achieved despite a prior year reserve strengthening charge of $400 million, a COVID provision of $76 million and catastrophe losses of $70 million. This clearly demonstrates the diversification and earnings power of Everest. Everest reported net income of $64 million for the quarter and $514 million for the year, resulting in a return on equity of 5.8% for 2020. we had a $44 million operating loss for Q4 given the charges and generated an operating income of $300 million for the year. Our net income in the quarter reflects strong investment income performance, and improved attritional loss and combined ratios offset by cat, COVID and reserve charges. The catastrophe losses of $70 million are pretax and net of reinsurance with $60 million from reinsurance and $10 million from insurance, driven by hurricanes Delta, Zeta and the Australian Queensland hailstorm. The estimate implied market share of industry losses is just over 60 basis points for Everest. This is an excellent result, reflecting the underwriting and risk management initiatives of the past two years. There was also no development from prior cats in the Q4 charge. Year-to-date, the results include catastrophe losses of $425 million, compared to $576 million during 2019. all amounts are pretax and net of reinstatement premiums. In the fourth quarter, we added $76 million to our COVID loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our consistent reserving philosophy. This additional provision is predominantly IBNR for third-party lines. This amount includes $56 million in the Reinsurance segment and $20 million in the Insurance segment, and in addition to the $435 million of pandemic losses estimated in the first nine months of 2020. our fourth quarter estimates were not impacted by the recent UK Supreme court ruling. As we had taken a prudent approach to loss assessment leading up to that ruling. for the full year 2020, the total pandemic loss provision is $511 million, of which more than 80% is classified as IBNR. Everest had an underwriting loss in Q4 of $219 million due to the prior year reserve adjustment charge as compared to an underwriting loss of $29 million for Q4 2019. As Juan mentioned, we booked a $400 million prior year reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter, exclusively for the reinsurance division, primarily within long-tail casualty segments, such as GL, auto liability and professional lines for accident years 2015 through 2018. the reserve charge also includes actions on non-cat property lines, primarily for the 2017 through 2019 accident years and driven by a few large losses to aggregate programs. Our reserve studies indicate that the insurance division overall has strong and adequate reserve levels. at a granular level, we address some redundancies and deficiencies with no overall financial impact. The lines we strengthened included professional liability in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. this was offset by releases and other lines. Turning to Everest\u2019s market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $10.5 billion, up $1.3 billion or 15% compared to 2019. This reflects strong and diversified growth in both segments with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to 2019. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and improving. Excluding the catastrophe losses and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the attritional combined ratio was 87.5% for 2020, compared to 88.4% for 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for 2020 was 60.1%, down from 60.2% for 2019 with insurance improving from 66% to 64.8%. for reinsurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate and prior year reserve charge was 85.2%, down from 85.5% in 2019. for insurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 94.2%, compared to 96.5% in 2019. our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our insurance business, continues to run at an attritional combined ratio in the low-90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 21.6% year-to-date was down from 23% in 2019, largely due to business mix, a one-time significant contingent commission in the Reinsurance segment during 2019 and higher seeding commission in the Insurance segment. the group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% for 2020 versus 6% for 2019, as we benefited from premium growth and continued focus on expense management. Q4 investment income had a strong performance of $222 million, compared to $146 million for Q4 2019. for the full year, pre-tax investment income was $642 million versus $647 million for 2019. The fixed income portfolio generated $542 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $520 million for the same period last year. limited partnerships recorded $91 million of income quarter-to-date, largely due to fair market value adjustments. Limited partnership result was due to the continued improvement of the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. Invested assets grew 23% to $25.4 billion versus $20.7 billion last year-end. This strong invested asset growth was due to $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and the proceeds of our debt issue. The pre-tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was just under 3%, down from 3.4% one year ago. Approximately, 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high-credit quality bond portfolio with duration of 3.6 years. The remaining portfolio is allocated to equities and other invested assets, which are largely private equity investments with the residual amount in short-term investments and cash. Our effective tax rate on operating income for 2020 was 7.7% and 12.1% on net income. for 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about six points of loss ratio. Everest generated record operating cash flows of $2.9 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2019, reflecting the strengths of our growing premiums in 2020 year-over-year, and a more modest level of claims paid. Everest enjoys very strong financial strength with ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders\u2019 equity was $9.7 billion at year-end 2020, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. net book value per share stood at $243.25, up 11.4% versus year-end 2019 adjusted for dividends ever. Everest\u2019s strong balance sheet was further strengthened by the 30 year $1 billion senior notes offering completed in early October 2020. This is long-term capital for Everest and enhances the efficiency of our capital structure with our debt leverage, now standing at 16.4%. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to John. Jon Levenson : Thanks, Mark. operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up, and then rejoin the queue if you have anything else to ask. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question on, I want to touch on the reinsurance reserve charge. So one, I think in your opening remarks, you said that you guys had already selected more conservative loss picks. So, can you just \u2013 it would be helpful if you could provide more color there on them, will recent accident years just given right that there was strengthening of some of these long-tail lines going up to accident year 2018. So, can you just provide a little bit more color on what loss trend you\u2019re booking to in some of these lines, but in your reinsurance book and how we could think about confidence in the more recent accident year? Juan Andrade : Yes. thank you, Elyse. We go through a pretty detailed review of each of our segments. And frankly, one of the things that this new management team has done really in the past year is really, look at our carried reserves at a level of granularity that is pretty detailed. So, we basically look at the accident years, underwriting years, we\u2019re using the latest information to better understand trends, predict ultimate loss ratios. And frankly, try to figure out in a much detailed way, the direction of travel for the underwriting portfolios. So, I start there by giving you a sense of the detail of granularity that we go through and basically coming up with a strengthening that we did in the quarter. Now, that being said, as we set the accident years, really beginning at the end of 2019, and as we\u2019ve set the 2020 accident year, as we\u2019ve set the 2021 accident year, we were already looking at some of the loss trends that are impacting the industry. And so we bake those in when we made those loss picks, that\u2019s also one of the reasons why you don\u2019t see us taking up current accident year loss picks as a result of the reserve charge. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. But can you give us a sense, I guess I know that there\u2019s a many different business lines, but what kind of loss trends you\u2019re booking to within reinsurance? Juan Andrade : I don\u2019t know if we specifically disclosed the loss trends that that we booked too. But what I can tell you though is that we are booking \u2013 our current accident year loss ratio is very prudently and we have been again, starting at the end of 2020 and going into 2021. We have not seen a significant impact on severity in the most recent accident years. And we\u2019re very confident in, where we are at this point in time, both with the prior reserve actions that we took as well as the current year reserve loss picks that we have in place. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the insurance, on the reserves there as well. So, I think Mark, you mentioned, there was no overall financial impact from the review. but I believe you mentioned strengthening on professional lines for 2015 to 2018 and they\u2019re being releases and other lines. Can you give us the sense of the magnitude of the professional lines strengthening and then what were some of the other lines I\u2019m assuming maybe, worker\u2019s comp where you thought it was over leases? Mark Kociancic : Yes. the magnitude is relatively muted. You\u2019re looking at overall $3.2 billion of net reserves in the insurance segment for the group. And so the types of adjustments we\u2019re talking about are in the teens, it\u2019s quite small and the offsets are coming from other lines. worker\u2019s comp would be an example of one, but again, very modest movements relative to the overall reserve level of the segment. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Elyse. Operator : Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mike Phillips : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first on insurance still, looking at your core loss ratio and extra COVID losses, a really good improvement there, three points or so this quarter increasing in the last couple of quarters, I guess, how should we think about the margins there and I guess in the near term this year, as you focus on growth there, and we\u2019ve got industry concerns on COVID and loss trends, and everything else in the casualty ones. Juan Andrade : Yes. Sure. thanks. Mike, this is Juan Andrade. look, I think we are building meaningful margin momentum, and you can see that by our numbers for the fourth quarter and full year underwriting results, that improvement both in insurance and reinsurance is really driven by portfolio management, decisive underwriting actions, and intentional shifts in our portfolio mix. If we exclude workers\u2019 compensation, we\u2019re also seeing the rates are outpacing our expected loss costs, and as that rate has been earned on a growing premium base, that\u2019s also going to have a positive impact on expected margin going forward. but also in \u2013 and I would point this out, because this a very important point in addition to rate, we\u2019re also taking a broad array of underwriting actions, including more granular segmentation in the enforced book, management of attachment point, limits, terms and conditions, we\u2019re doing targeted non-renewals and many other actions. So, we\u2019re doing a number of things that you\u2019re starting to see show up in the underlying profitability of both insurance and reinsurance that are by design, and that are very proactive. It\u2019s not just all about rate, but it\u2019s also about all the other tools that we have in our kit about improving underlying margins. But all of that being said and I think this goes to your question, Mike, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that some lines do require more rate than others. It also depends on the starting point that depends on the loss cost trends, and we also have to recognize that we\u2019re in an environment, where the impact of COVID and the time that it will take for some of these claims to emerge. There\u2019s some uncertainty, right. We also have to think about the underlying social inflation cost. So overall, I feel very good about the margin momentum that we\u2019re creating in this business. It\u2019s not just about rate, but it\u2019s also about all the underlying levers that we\u2019re pulling forth. And I feel very good and very comfortable with both books of business going into 2021. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you, Juan. I appreciate that. I guess second question specifically on your comp book, you guys have a pretty sizable concentration in one state. and I\u2019m curious to hear what you are seeing in California in comps, given coming back from a shutdown and there\u2019s been some concerns on loss trends kind of rising there in the state. So, anything you can share with what you\u2019re seeing in that book? Juan Andrade : Sure, Mike. let me start, and then I\u2019ll ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in as well. I would say overall on the comp book, a couple of key things to keep in mind is, we have reduced the percentage of comp in our book of business over the last year, 18 months. It\u2019s now roughly down to about 16% of our mix, down from about 24%. And again, this has been done in a purposeful way, right. As you have seen less attractive pricing in the comp book, we have diversified into a business. And so you see our growth in lines like casualty, property, D&O, et cetera. The other thing that we have done in our comp book is we have also moved more towards loss, sensitive business, loss rated business on the comp side, and we\u2019ve done less basically guaranteed comp business at that point in time. So, we\u2019re actively managing the trend, we\u2019re actively managing what we\u2019re seeing in the environment, and obviously, trying to continue to drive a lot of profit in that comp book. But let me ask Mike Karm to jump in specifically on your question about California. Mike Karmilowicz : Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Mike. Yes. look, it\u2019s a continuation of what we said and shared in prior quarters about starting to see it bounce on the bottom, and we are seeing some pockets of some momentum upward. but in general, it\u2019s still a slightly in the negative side, that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the actions we have and just managing through the cycle. But we\u2019re hopefully cautious optimistic of what we foresee possibly towards the 2021 towards the second half of the year. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate that. Operator : Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning, everybody. First question, it goes back to the reserves strengthening, can you maybe, talk about law specs for 2019, 2020, 2021 accident years relative to where they currently are for the 2015 to 2018 accident years in GL, commercial auto and professional lines? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Yaron. I\u2019ll start with that. And then I\u2019ll ask Jim Williamson, who\u2019s our new Chief Operating Officer to add some color on this as well. So, I mentioned before to Elyse\u2019s question, particularly when we set the accident year loss picks for 2020 and 2021, we were more conservative than the picks that had been in place for the 2015 through 2019 accident years. And that was really a reflection of what we saw in the environment, some of the industry trends that we were seeing, et cetera. So, we took a more prudent approach in being able to set those. So, I would tell you that as I sit here today, looking at 2020, 2021, they\u2019re stronger than the picks that we had in place for 2015 to 2018, but I would ask Jim Williamson to add some color on that as well. Jim Williamson : Yes. Sure, Yaron. just in terms of a little bit more detail, I mean, I think one thing to keep in mind is, we\u2019re performing this analysis at a very detailed and granular level. And so there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in terms of picks that have come up over that period, where we\u2019re now at a higher level, and then other areas, where we\u2019ve taken so much rate, so many underwriting actions and the picks have come down. I think the key thing to keep in mind though, is that as Juan had indicated, we took a very conservative approach to the setting of the loss picks for the 2020 accident year, the 2021 accident year. And those picks are consistent with the level of ultimate loss ratio that\u2019s coming out of the reserve studies. And that gives us confidence that our starting point is the right one. We\u2019re taking rate in excess of our loss trend, right. So, those things give you a confidence that moving forward, we\u2019re positioned in the right way in the portfolio. Yaron Kinar : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then my second question actually goes to top-line growth. On your opening comments, did I get the \u2013 or I got the feeling from the opening comments that maybe, you\u2019re deemphasizing growth in reinsurance over insurance in the foreseeable future. is that correct? Juan Andrade : No, no. not at all, Yaron. what I was saying in my opening remarks is that we have a very good market right now in both insurance and reinsurance, and our intent is very much to continue growing as long as the opportunities are there for us to be able to do this profitably. We have a leading franchise in P&C, reinsurance. we\u2019re the seventh largest in the world. We are aiming to continue to grow that presence, continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I would also point you to my comments around our January 1 renewals and the fact that we had one of the strongest renewals we have seen in a number of years. And so look, as long as the market opportunity is there, as long as we can underwrite profitably, we\u2019re taking advantage of that. We are very well positioned, whether it\u2019s from a capital standpoint, a distribution standpoint, a talent standpoint, to be able to continue moving forward in this market with a lot of momentum. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. I appreciate the comments. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Yaron. Operator : Josh Shanker with bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Good morning, everybody. My first question, I know you can\u2019t speak to others books, but we see something in your book that looks similar to what we\u2019ve seen in others. Most of the improvement during this year has come on the expense ratio side of the combined ratio, despite very, very strong rate increases already coming through in earned rates. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about why we\u2019re seeing such large expense ratio improvements, whether it\u2019s sustainable and just giving your many, many years of work in the industry. What\u2019s going on here? This is not just an Everest phenomenon. Juan Andrade : Yes. sure. Thanks, Josh. So, I would say a couple of things. We certainly have seen an improvement in the expense ratio and that\u2019s really coming from two areas. One is on the commission side. And I think there\u2019s different factors there. I think if you look at insurance first, a part of that is that we\u2019re writing more direct business through our brokers and less DUA business overall. And so I think that\u2019s part of what you\u2019re seeing there. We also; in our insurance business, because of mix; get the benefit of improved cede commissions. I think our team has done a very good job in setting up their external reinsurance program. So, you see some of that coming through on the commissions. On the reinsurance side, I think it\u2019s also pointed to mix; at the same time, on the commission line. but more importantly, to me, it\u2019s really the operating expense ratio. One of the hallmarks of our company has been that we are lean. We\u2019re disciplined on how we manage expenses. We invest where we need to invest in technology and people, and infrastructure, but we\u2019re also very disciplined about how we do that. And that\u2019s something that you saw us continue to accomplish in 2020 and up to 2021. That actually drives that expense ratio to where you see it today. We also experienced loss ratio improvement and you see that particularly, in the insurance business for 2020. And that is really related to all of those actions that I mentioned in my opening remarks, what I term is really the hard work of running a profitable book of business, right. This is managing attachment points and limits, and running off programs and books of business that you\u2019re not comfortable with and always seeking out the best economic opportunities to continue to improve the profitability of that business. So, to me, those were all the actions that one has to take to continue to improve underwriting profitability and sustain a profitable book going forward. Josh Shanker : And my second question, maybe, I\u2019ll try and get back in line then, the 6% expected normalized cat load for the coming year. It\u2019s obviously, materially lower than where Everest has been in the past. So that\u2019s where it\u2019s been trending, given the property cat renewals, which weren\u2019t as good as some were hoping certainly better than they\u2019ve been. Do we expect that long-term Everest volatility is going to stay low or we\u2019re just at a place right now in pricing, where it just doesn\u2019t make sense to take on a lot of cat risk? Juan Andrade : Yes. So, let me start with that. And then I\u2019ll ask John Doucette to jump in and add additional color to all of this. Josh, as you heard in my opening remarks, particularly at January 1st, we did increase the amount of limit that we deployed on the cat side. And we did that and feel very comfortable with it, because of the pricing, the terms and conditions that we\u2019re getting. look, at the end of the day, volatility in of itself, is not a bad thing, as long as you\u2019re getting paid for it. And from our perspective, we were getting paid for it in January 1; we were getting paid for it throughout 2020. Now that being said, our goal is to build a diversified book of business is not just to ride one pony if you will. And so if the opportunities are there on cat to be able to do it profitably, to get a good risk adjusted return, improve our ROEs, et cetera, we\u2019re going to do it. And you saw us do that in the renewal seasons of last year and really going into January 1st. So, the appetite is there, but it\u2019s there at a price, and it\u2019s there at a point that makes sense to us economically. So with that, let me turn it over to John Doucette and have him add some color as well. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan and good morning, Josh. Yes. look, we had a very good one-one with significant rate increase. we saw a double-digit growth across many, many lines of business. And in terms of property, we did see rate increases in the U.S. 5% to 10%, in retro 10% to 15%. And really, it was a question of how we allocated the book and where we decided to deploy the capacity. and so number one, where do we decide to deploy the capacity. We also saw very good opportunities in the primary property space. So, we deployed more capacity into both cat and to primary property quota share, which we liked the risk return on that opportunity. So, that\u2019s number one. number two, as noted, we have increased the AUM and Logan, and continue to look for ways to increase that and look to have that continue to be a very strategic part of our volatility management, capital management, and that will help decrease the volatility that you\u2019re seeing. And then number three, as Juan said, a lot of this is about diversification, diversification within the reinsurance, diversification by growing the insurance operation. So, it\u2019s different lines, territories, products, and that will result in just a lower, dollars may be flat, but \u2013 or even up a little bit, but as a percentage of overall gross premium, the percentage of our cat load could be lower. Josh Shanker : Okay. Well, thank you for all the answers. I appreciate it. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning. First is a follow-up to Josh\u2019s question. So, I think a lot of us look at the historical cat load and listen to your guidance and obviously, you have a lot more info than us on the cat load of being six points. So, to the answer to the last question are \u2013 is Mt. Logan taking a portion of the historical cat load, right. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s going to other investors that aren\u2019t equity investors. And is that maybe, the piece that we, as investors, don\u2019t fully appreciate, because you\u2019re ceding to kind of a new set of investors versus pre-Mt. Logan that was all going to Everest. Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Juan and again, let me start, and then I\u2019ll ask John Doucette to jump in as well. What I would say that on that 6% cat load that Mark was referring to, it\u2019s really a question of how we manage our exposure into reinsurance book and really, what we have been doing, frankly, over the last 18 months or so, to make sure that we\u2019re in a better place, more profitable place, more sustainable place from a catastrophe standpoint. Again, I go back to what I said earlier. We like cat, but it has to be priced right, has to be managed correctly. You\u2019ve seen a lot of things that we have done that have been frankly reflected in some of the catastrophe loss numbers that we\u2019ve put out in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. we have moved up to higher attachment points. We\u2019re writing less aggravated programs. we\u2019re frankly writing a more profitable book and more sustainable book. And so that\u2019s part of what you see there. The other part of that is our capital shield, our hedging strategy for the company. Logan certainly plays a role there. Our Kilimanjaro bonds certainly play a role there, and there\u2019s other things that we\u2019re doing at the same time. You will see that we grew AUM in our Logan book and our Logan vehicle to the beginning of this year. And that certainly, helps us well in essentially protecting our net position within the company. But let me ask John Doucette to jump in and add some additional color. John Doucette : Yes. thanks, Juan. And so Mt. Logan, we\u2019ve been \u2013 Mt. Logan\u2019s been in effect since 2013. And it\u2019s \u2013 it has grown and then came down a little bit in AUM and now has starting back up. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a definitionally, it used to go to Everest and now, it goes to Logan. It\u2019s part of a holistic suite of both what we\u2019re doing on the growth side, capital management side and the hedging side. And it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s part of that, but it\u2019s clearly a core part of this, of how we\u2019re thinking of capital management, volatility management going forward. But I mean, we also saw as Juan said earlier, while we did increase limits on the gross portfolio in our property book across property cat, retro and pro rata. we did increase that, because of the opportunity set, but we saw an increase in overall premium and a larger increase in expected dollar margin and percentage margin and an increase in the ROE. So, a part of it is how we\u2019re thinking of what we want to keep on our balance sheet and other parts of the balance sheet. But I do think it\u2019s more, I think then your \u2013 how you\u2019re focusing on it. It\u2019s more a function of the diversification. as a function of premium, it really has more to do with the diversification, the growth in the insurance operation as a percentage, the growth in reinsurance in different lines of business. We saw a lot of opportunities in casualty, continue to see opportunities in mortgage, professional liability, significant opportunities in fact, and all of that is on the \u2013 is growing the denominator of the 6% cat load that you\u2019re talking about. And I think that is driving it more than specifically, in Logan or outside of Logan. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, those answers. And my last question is just thinking about the reserving additions that were added this past quarter, the $400 million, should we be thinking stepping back, are you adopting a new reserving methodology at all in a portion of the portfolio. I guess, sometimes we get questions at some of your peers, they kind of seek \u2013 they seek to, I think strategically kind of book, or maybe just overbook and be releasers, I\u2019m just kind of curious is there \u2013 is there anything we should be thinking about that\u2019s kind of changing on a go-forward basis versus how you historically picked? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Juan. Look, I think from my perspective, the company has a very disciplined and multi-faceted approach to reserving and risk management, and that doesn\u2019t change. But I bring you back to my earlier comments. There\u2019s always opportunities for improvement on how you look at the data. So, from our perspective, the new senior management team that we have in place is very granular and very detailed in how we look at IBNR groups, and how we look at accident years by portfolio, by segment, et cetera, et cetera. And we\u2019re making fact-based decisions based on the trending and the information that our reserving studies give us in what our actuarial department is able to provide to us. And so that is basically if there\u2019s a change, it\u2019s that, it\u2019s the fact of that we\u2019re being a lot more granular in how we look at the portfolios? How we make decisions based on the information that it\u2019s there? And how we react to that basically? Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess another follow-up on the charge and the reinsurance. Just trying to get a little bit more texture, is this mainly a few large programs? There\u2019s a little bit more broad-based and then also just maybe, you could give us some feel for how you\u2019re reserved for those accident years, 2015, 2018, relative to the loss ratio in the indications from the seasons. how your loss picks compared to the loss ratios being reported to you in those years? Juan Andrade : Yes. So Ryan, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start, and then I\u2019ll ask both Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson to add a little bit of color on this one. On the reinsurance strengthening that we took, it was really a factor of a few things. Number one, we had a few seasons with a poor experience in those accident years, and on those seasons, we have subsequently reduced our lines or essentially completely non-renewed the effected accounts. So that\u2019s part of that. There\u2019s also the fact that we had some pretty large losses coming through and some of those years, whether it was wildfires, MGM, et cetera. And that\u2019s part of that. And then the other part of that is really just general social inflation or the trend that we saw out in the marker that was generating some higher severity losses than what we anticipated too. So that\u2019s basically what we saw in our reserving studies, that essentially led to us taking the strengthening actions that we did. But let me now turn it over to Mark and then Jim, for a little bit of additional color on your question. Mark Kociancic : Just a bit more on that, Ryan. I think in addition to what Juan was saying, when we took a look at these individual lines in accident years, we were looking also at the magnitude of uncertainty. So in other words, where are we within the ranges? And I think the strengthening that we put up in these individual years in lines, we feel pretty good about. So, we feel like there\u2019s a good level of prudence that\u2019s been set up for these and it solves the problem for us. Jim Williamson : Yes. And so that\u2019s sort of close it out with just a little bit of color around the piece of your question that sort of looks to translate, seen underlying loss ratio to what we\u2019re experiencing. I mean, look, the reserving process is based on our own loss activity. And I think there are clearly areas where you can draw a more direct connection if you\u2019re talking about, for example, a quota share book. So, in the cases we\u2019re participating in a proportional fashion with our seasons and they\u2019re seeing social inflation, average claim sizes have increased on the casualty side or in the case of water damage claims that are elevating property losses that\u2019s going to be a more direct translation, where I think that starts to break down those when you start talking about 3D structures that are not a direct quota share participation. you can\u2019t always draw those direct lines. And so I\u2019d be a little bit careful about that, but if you think about the things in the general trends that have affected primary insurers in the 2015 to 2018 on the casualty sort of 2016 and 2019 on property, it\u2019s sort of the same drivers of loss that we are seeing in our book are the ones you\u2019re hearing from other companies. So, I think it\u2019s consistent in that fashion. Ryan Tunis : Got it. That was helpful and I guess talking about \u2013 like hearing you guys talking about how the loss fix in 2020 and also 2021 are more conservative. So obviously, you\u2019ve taken a view on 2021. I\u2019m just curious, thinking about the 58%-ish ex-COVID accident year loss ratio to reinsurance, should we think that given the higher 2021 loss pick, how easy or difficult do you think it\u2019ll be to improve on that next year, also taking into consideration the rate backdrop? Thanks. Juan Andrade : Yes. Ryan, this is Juan. Thank you. Look, I go back to some of my earlier comments, where for us, it\u2019s not just simply about rate, but it\u2019s also about all the other levers that we have within the underwriting portfolio and within the underwriting toolkit that we\u2019re executing upon, right. So, if you think about how John and his team are positioning the team from an attachment standpoint, from a structuring into treaties, how they\u2019re playing on pro ratas to be able to take advantage of the improvement in primary rates, et cetera, et cetera, all of these are things that are going into the improvement of our underlying margin and frankly, why I said at the beginning of all of this that we are building meaningful margin momentum in our underlying book of business. And I feel pretty good about that. So, the reality is we\u2019re working at this every day, whether it\u2019s in reinsurance and insurance, with the goal of continuing to improve our margins, improve our profitability, improve our loss ratios, et cetera, et cetera. So, you\u2019re going to continue seeing taking actions across the board, again, not just necessarily all rate related, but there\u2019s a lot of things we can do in the portfolio that also influenced that and we\u2019re doing them today. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Two questions. The first one, Juan, just curious, if we look at the return, you\u2019re probably generating a new business right now. And then just curious what your thoughts are on that, is that better than actually repurchasing your shares at this point, given that you\u2019re trading at a discount to book value? Juan Andrade : Yes. So look, I think a couple of things, and then I\u2019ll ask Mark Kociancic to jump in as well. From a capital management philosophy standpoint, our approach really hasn\u2019t changed. Number one, we invest in our company and in the organic growth that we see there. We happened to be at a place in time, where we have terrific opportunities in the insurance side, under reinsurance side and you see from our numbers, we\u2019re taking advantage of them. fact is we\u2019re leaning forward. The fact that we grew 15% in a pandemic year with an economic recession, exposure reductions, I think is a very good outcome. And I think that gives you a sense of how we\u2019re investing in our business to continue to grow and take advantage of those opportunities. At the same time, we also then look at other things that we can do to return capital to our shareholders. And I\u2019ll let Mark talk a little bit about that. Mark Kociancic : So Brian, I think both parts are on the table. Obviously, the emphasis on franchise expansion in a hard market is paramount, the sizing come along quite some time. On the capital management side, though your points are well taken and that\u2019s clearly on our radar screen, I think share buybacks, the dividend policy, that\u2019s still all in play and very much in our line of sight. But we do have, I think, a unique opportunity to capture a lot of benefits from this hard market. Brian Meredith : And I guess you don\u2019t have the flexibility to do both at the same time, grow and buyback? Mark Kociancic : No, we do. Yes. Brian Meredith : Okay. Mark Kociancic : Yes. we have full capability on both sides. So, whether it\u2019s attacking the market and taking advantage of opportunities and doing the capital management aspects that you\u2019ve seen in the past. Jim Williamson : Yes, Brian. And I would jump in there as well. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, we have the capital flexibility to attack this market and we\u2019re doing it. As I mentioned earlier, based on the growth rates that you\u2019re seeing, we also did the $1 billion debt raise back in October of last year. And that has not been deployed for growth yet, that has been invested in our portfolio, but we have dry powder. So, we have the ability to continue to do what we need to do in this market and take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. Brian Meredith : Real helpful. And then my second question, Juan. I\u2019m just curious, could you give us some perspective on where do you think we are with respect to COVID loss recognition and what are the potential future exposures kind of related to COVID? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thank you for that. Look, I feel very good and very confident, where we are with our COVID numbers. We were very consistent in our reserving throughout 2020. Our processes were very good, very thorough. As Mark mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019re at $511 million for the year of 2020, over 80% of that is IBNR. We look at the claims activity, that\u2019s been coming in. We have not been surprised. Everything has been tracking along sort of what we expected. So, I feel very confident about where we are with those COVID numbers. Now, all of that being said, the pandemic is still ongoing, right. That that has not eased, it continues. And things that we look at are there going to be other legal, regulatory legislative type things that happen that we haven\u2019t seen yet, right. So, those are the things that are still out there potentially. The other thing that\u2019s out there is the fact that as a reinsurer, we do get late information from our seasons. but all of that being said, I feel very confident about where we are with that $511 million that we took in 2020. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Derek Han with KBW. your line is open. Meyer Shields : Hi, this is Meyer \u2013 is with me. Juan Andrade : Yes. Hi Meyer. Meyer Shields : Great. I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t catch the name. So, two quick questions. One, the cat load is consistent in terms of expectations on a year-over-year business \u2013 year-over-year basis. And I was hoping you could break that down between business exchanges that had been driving down the catalyst ratio in prior years and maybe, just a more pessimistic expectation of losses, because of climate change or other factors underlying trends. Juan Andrade : Yes, that\u2019s good. So, let me start with that. And then I\u2019ll ask John Doucette to come back into it. Again, I think part of what you\u2019re seeing in that 6% cat load that Mark alluded to, it\u2019s essentially the end result of a lot of the management actions to proactive underwriting actions that the team has taken really over the last 12 months to 18 months to better improve and better manage the volatility of our portfolio. So, you\u2019re definitely seeing that essentially come through at the same time. Now, regarding the point on climate change, we are very mindful of that, right. So, one of the things that our modeling does particularly under reinsurance division is really look at the impact of rising sea temperatures that you can clearly see from 1995 onto current. And based on that, we have adapted our modeling. We have updated our points of view on risk, on pricing to better be able to manage that. So, all of that is essentially baked into that, but let me turn it over to John Doucette and let him add a little bit of color on that as well. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. And yes, just continue on. So, two things we spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of how we manage the risk in our property portfolio. It\u2019s all the aspects of climate risk. We spent a lot of time looking at wildfire and frankly derisking the wildfire exposure in our portfolio, spent a lot of time looking at the warm sea surface temperature, looking at droughts and the propensity for drought. So, a lot of how we deploy capacity, what should the right attachments, products, terms, conditions, and frankly, rate be looking at that. So, number one is climate change. And number two is, we\u2019ve also been looking a lot at the different social inflation and risks that we\u2019ve seen in the books. Things like assignment of benefits to LAE, the increase in LAE that we\u2019ve seen in different areas, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And so that\u2019s all factored into how we think about building the best portfolio, learning from the lessons that the industry has seen and really positioning our book on a go-forward basis. And it also, it has some loss trends for the reasons I just mentioned climate and some of the social issues, but it also \u2013 we also were seeing the uplift that we\u2019re getting from improved rates, terms, conditions, occurrence clauses, hours clauses, et cetera, et cetera. So, all of that is we have several countercurrent that result in the 6% you\u2019re looking at here. Meyer Shields : Okay. That was very thorough. Thanks. And then the second, really quickly, can you give us some picture of expectations of ceding commissions, both what you\u2019re going to expect to pay in reinsurance and collect in insurance on a year-over-year basis? Juan Andrade : Sure. So, John Doucette, why don\u2019t you start with that? And then we\u2019ll go to Mike Karm for the insurance piece of it. John Doucette : Yes. Thanks, Juan. So, it\u2019ll vary by line by territory, et cetera, by loss experience of the clients. So, one of \u2013 there\u2019s been significant underlying rate improvement, terms and condition improvement on casualty and professional liability. And so our view is that the casualty reinsurance market was rationale. for the most part, ceding commissions were about flat. But we did see an economic uplift at one just based on our exposure to the underlying terms and conditions. And then that would be very last dependent. If somebody had bad, poor loss experience, they could see a cut in the ceding commissions. And on property overall, we did see an improvement in the overall reinsurance terms and both in terms of like occurrence, limits as well as ceding commissions. And I think that really was just a function of the overall capacity dearth on a proportional reinsurance. So, we were able to deploy and wanted to deploy more into that space. Mike Karmilowicz : Yes. I think it really comes down from the insurance perspective, really on the value of the reinsurance relationships that we are successfully maintaining all the ceding conditions commissions that renewed over the last several months. I would say one comment is, our books varied and we had certain portfolios, like I mentioned, we had the beneficiary of that for some of the things, Juan mentioned earlier about ceding commissions that we gained by some of the portfolio mix and certain lines like specialty casualty and other specialty lines, like transactional and credit and political risk. So, we didn\u2019t have really top talent in these areas, which I think have generated better terms and conditions for us in some of our reinsurance. But I think as we continue the journey, we see opportunity and we certainly think there\u2019s also opportunities for us to manage that more effectively. Meyer Shields : Thank you very much. Operator : We have time for one more question, Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Phil Stefano : Yes, thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Brian\u2019s question about the COVID charges. Can you just provide us with a reminder of how to think about, is there a date that you have booked this through? Is it just the calendar year 2020 losses, or to what extent was 2020 and the potential ongoing nature of the pandemic contemplated in the 511 reserves? Juan Andrade : Yes. sure, thanks, Phil. let me ask Jim Williamson to address that question for you. Jim Williamson : Yes. Phil, to provide a little bit of color, I think it\u2019s important to understand the process we go through to arrive at these estimates, it\u2019s incredibly granular. So, we are basically reviewing each and every reinsurance contract we have in each of our markets around the world. We do that multiple times each quarter. And the goal of those underwriter estimates is to get a total view of estimated losses for those contracts. And so it\u2019s not really isolated to any particular time period. It\u2019s focused on the extent of the contract and what we think those losses are going to be. So, I mean I think that\u2019s the core of the answer to the question. I think it\u2019s important to note though, that obviously our understanding of what that total is going to be is informed by the duration of the pandemic, et cetera, as well as the reporting lag that Juan pointed out. But our goal is always to try to estimate the totality of loss. Phil Stefano : Okay. And as we think about the growth is coming into the business, and maybe, this is more focused on insurance and reinsurance, but the potential for economies of scale, as we think about nominal expenses moving forward, it feels like the insurance business has some investments in teams and the building out of the functions and things like that. Does it feel like that should slow down and we return \u2013 or we come to a point, where expense growth on a dollar basis, is much more inflation plus or minus, or their investments still to be made in helping us think about the economies of scale you can pull through. Juan Andrade : Yes, Phil. I think that\u2019s a great question. Look, the insurance division is now a $3.2 billion business, right. So that\u2019s a good size insurance company. We are still making investments in technology and people, data, and analytics, product expansion, a number of things. And that\u2019s not going to stop, right. Because we think we have a terrific opportunity in front of us, particularly in this market to continue to be able to grow that. Now, that being said, we also expect that we will continue to manage our expenses in a very disciplined way in the way we have been now. So, focusing on things like digital automation, those types of things to make us more productive, much more efficient, those are things that are very much top of mind, and they\u2019re also being implemented as we go forward. So, there will be investment that will continue in business. We will be reaching economies of scale as you point out. I think we\u2019re pretty close to that, and the focus is on how do we become more productive, more effective, more efficient as we grow that business. Operator : And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for final remarks. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you. So, I think as you can see from our results, we have strong growth. We have strong underlying improvement and we have great momentum going into 2021. The company is very well positioned for this market. We have the financial strength, a preferred market presence, a diversified global platform, we are nimble, we have a deep distribution relationship we have great people and we have a great culture. We\u2019re very well positioned. So, thank you for your time with us this quarter and for your support of our company. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Jon Levenson : Good morning. And welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Everest Executives leading today\u2019s call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today\u2019s call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest is off to a strong start in 2021, with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We achieved these results, despite the meaningful impact to the industry of the U.S. winter storms in the first quarter. Our thoughts are with those affected by the storms, as well as the Australian floods and I am very proud of the work our claims team is doing on the ground to help people restore their lives. Our first quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our success in implementing our strategy to build a broadly diversified company with a relentless focus on operational performance and disciplined underwriting. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the Insurance segment, while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a leading global P&C reinsurer. Our diversified Reinsurance and Insurance franchises, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable us to thrive in today\u2019s market. I will now discuss our Group, Reinsurance and Insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the Group results, we grew gross written premiums by 14% and net written premiums by 16% with robust growth across both segments. Our growth stems from, one, the combination of new business opportunities, two, improved terms and conditions, three, increased rate levels, four, expanded shares on attractive renewals, and five, high overall renewal retention. The as-reported combined ratio was 98.1%, including the previously announced U.S. winter storms and the Australian flooding catastrophe losses. We generated $45 million in underwriting profit, compared to $29 million in the first quarter last year. While the pandemic is not over and as we have done in prior quarters, we completed a rigorous analysis of our COVID exposure in the first quarter, resulting in no change to our COVID loss provision. Our COVID loss provision remains at $511 million, of which approximately 80% is IBNR. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3%, a 2.5 point improvement over the first quarter of 2020 with both segments continuing to show significant year-over-year improvement in loss and expense ratios. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions. This includes managing attachment points and limits, improving on terms and conditions and targeting non-renewals of business, which does not meet our hurdle rates, as well as many other actions. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. Net investment income was excellent at $260 million, compared to $148 million in the prior year first quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $342 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. For our Reinsurance Division, the first quarter continued our strong growth, with gross written premiums up 16%. We were pleased with our successful execution of our January 1 renewal plan. The targeted and disciplined growth was driven by higher rate, increased shares on profitable deals, along with new opportunities in property, casualty, specialty lines and facultative business. The attritional combined ratio was 85.5% for the quarter, a 2.3 point improvement year-over-year. This came from improvement in both the loss and expense ratio. We saw better economics in most treaties and parts of business around the world. We were disciplined and reduce shares or non-renewed underperforming treaties or those where we did not get our target rate, terms, conditions, wordings, or exclusions. We also deployed additional capacity into lines with more attractive risk adjusted returns. This dynamic capital allocation resulted in an improved attritional combined ratio. Overall, we continue to write a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. With regard to the April 1 renewals, we achieved 10% to 15% rate increases on Japanese wind treaties and 5% rate increases in earthquake treaties. Rates in other geographies continue to rise in both property and casualty lines. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our Insurance Division continued its solid execution in the market, resulting in strong attritional underwriting performance and premium growth. Gross written premium grew 10%. If we exclude workers\u2019 compensation where we see less attractive pricing, gross written premium grew 20%. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, ongoing strong rate increases in our target classes of business and high retention rates on existing business. We are also seeing a slow but steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in our target classes, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty, casualty, professional liability and property short tail. We are happy with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. Everest Insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 92.2% for the first quarter, a 2.7 point improvement over Q1 2020. These results continue to be driven by proactive underwriting actions and a continued focus on expense management. These actions are resulting in the continued expansion of our Insurance margins. The attritional loss ratio of 64.3%, improved 1.4 points year-over-year and the total expense ratio improved 1.3 points year-over-year. Renewal rate increases continue to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 16% in the quarter excluding workers\u2019 compensation and up 10% including workers\u2019 compensation. The increased rate we achieved and the expected increase in margin is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments remain necessary. We expect this favorable pricing to continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, rate increases were led by excess casualty up 33%, D&O up 24%, property up 13% and commercial auto up 13%. We are also seeing widespread rate increases in other lines of business. We are managing the Insurance business to build a diversified portfolio, steering our mixed or product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continue to manage average limits deployed to control volatility. We are happy with the progress we have made and we expect that the strategic direction should possibly impact our results going forward. Conversely, we have been thoughtfully managing workers\u2019 compensation through the cycle. This portfolio now represents 14% of our first quarter premiums, down from 21% the year ago. We have pared back for writings in the monoline guaranteed cost base and shift in our portfolio to more loss sensitive, loss ratable business. Workers\u2019 compensation is an area of expertise at Everest and we are monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate the disciplined cycle management we have implemented in the company. Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continue to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Everest had a strong start to 2021, with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to customers. We have sustained momentum. This company has excellent financial strength, top talent, and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe that the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategies will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest\u2019s future and in our ability to deliver and our commitments to customers and shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment results. I will touch on these points over the next few minutes. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest reported a net income of $342 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. We also reported operating income of $260 million for Q1 and operating earnings per share of $6.49. Starting with underwriting income, Everest had positive contributions from both Reinsurance and Insurance with $45.2 million of underwriting income. This reflects the improved underlying attritional loss and expense ratios, offset by the impact of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses of $260 million of pretax and net of Reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $213 million in the Reinsurance segment and $47 million in the Insurance segment. Vast majority of $250 million is coming from the U.S. winter storms with the balance from the floods in New South Wales, Australia. Also worth noting is that we have not added to our COVID-19 loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with approximately 80% of our pandemic loss estimate remaining as IBNR. First quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and continue to improve, excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID 19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio was 60.7% in Q1, compared to 61.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3% for the first quarter of 2021, compared to 89.8% for the first quarter last year, representing a 2.5 percentage point improvement. For Insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved from 65.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 64.3% this quarter. And the attritional combined ratio for Insurance improved to 92.2%, compared to 94.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Our U.S. Insurance business, which makes up the majority of our overall Insurance business, continues to run very well, with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. For Reinsurance, the first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.5%, down from 59.8% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio on the same basis was 85.5%, down from 87.8%. The Group commission ratio of 20.5% for the first quarter of 2021, was down a 150 basis points from 22% reported last year in Q1, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix plus higher ceding commissions received in the Insurance segment. The Group expense ratio remains low at 5.9% for the first quarter of 2021 versus 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management, cost economies of scale as our premium base continues to grow. First quarter investment income had an excellent result of $260 million, as compared to a $148 million for the first quarter 2020. Alternative investments recorded a quarterly record $120 million of income in the first quarter, largely due to increases in the net asset values from our portfolio of diversified private equity investments, reflecting the strong economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. Invested assets grew approximately 2% to $25.9 billion during the quarter, up from $25.5 billion at year end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.5 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective tax rate on operating income for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9% and 8.4% on net income. This was favorable versus our planned effective tax rate of approximately 12%, largely due to the geographic distribution of the catastrophe losses occurring within the United States. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest generated strong operating cash flows of $904 million, compared to $506 million for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders\u2019 equity was $9.7 billion at the end of the first quarter and broadly flat versus the $9.7 billion at year end 2020. Our debt leverage ratio stands at 16.5% and book value per share stood at $241.57 at quarter end. I close in noting that Everest repurchased approximately $24 million of common shares during the first quarter. And with that, I will now turn it back to Jon. Jon Levenson : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions. Operator : Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question here comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, if we went back to last year, you guys within your Insurance book we are getting 24% of price that was excluding comps, 12% with workers comp and if we were to assume a 5% loss trend that would have resulted in about 4 points of accident year underlying loss ratio improvement this quarter and when we look at the Insurance book in back of COVID you produced just under 1.5 points. So is it a -- is a good rule of thumb that you will apply less than a half of the improvement brought at the bottomline and the other half you would use to build some reserves conservatism? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Thanks, Elyse. And this is Juan and good morning also. I think there\u2019s a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one is, we had strong results across the Board. As I said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s a 2.5 point improvement in the combined ratio year-over-year. When you look specifically at the Insurance Division, that\u2019s a 2.7 improvement that you are seeing there as well. But frankly is led by the loss ratio with 1.4 improvements in the attritional loss ratio. Now the mechanics of that improvement, I think, it\u2019s along the lines of what we discussed in prior quarters. So, certainly, we are seeing very good rate. We saw as I mentioned 16% rate increases in the Insurance book in the first quarter and that continues to do quite well. As a matter of fact to put it in perspective that 16% is 2 times the rate that we achieved in all of 2019. So rate is part of that. But the bigger part of all of this is really the myriad of actions that we are taking on the underwriting side. As I mentioned previously, to continue to position our book of business both on the Insurance side and the Reinsurance side to have sustained profitability over the long term. And it\u2019s important to keep in mind, one thing, right, we are deliberately shifting the portfolios toward segments that have better overall economics. In addition to all the underwriting actions that we are taking and that I have mentioned in the past and in my script to continue to improve sustained profitability. Now when it comes to loss picks, I think, it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that we continue to hold the line on loss picks. We have clear indications that underlying profitability is continuing to improve, some of that you saw in this quarter\u2019s results and some of that will need to be proven over time as the accident years continue to mature. So I think that\u2019s probably the best guidance that I can give you on that. And with that, let me ask also one of my colleagues Jim Williamson to jump into this question as well. Jim Williamson : Yeah. Good morning, Elyse. The only thing I would add and I think it\u2019s important both in Insurance and Reinsurance, and I suspect it\u2019s on the minds of everyone on the call today is, just this question of the loss trend and we talked about rate achievement exceeding the loss trend. But we have also talked over the last few years about the fact that the trend line has been accelerating in terms of whether it\u2019s social inflation, inflation in building cost in terms of repair after natural disasters and things of that nature. And so that does two things, one, it will certainly consume a little bit more of the rate increases and we want to be prudent about that, that\u2019s I would say a smaller effect. The larger effect though is the degree that, that places uncertainty around what the ultimate trend line will turn out to be, which is why we are going to take a very conservative position around making sure that we have proven out our trend selections over time, which would ultimately allow us to be looking on these accident years more favorably, but it\u2019s going to take time for that to fully mature. Elyse Greenspan : That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question on the other part of your margin is on the expense ratio. If I am looking at your consolidated expense ratio was around 26.4 I think in the quarter? And so in line with the levels that you guys saw in the second half of last year, but well below where you were pre-COVID. I am just trying to get a sense of what kind of -- and obviously there is the commission and brokerage ratio and also the other underwriting expenses, but just trying to get a sense of where the expense ratio should level out once we are kind of through with COVID and what kind of a run rate level there? Juan Andrade : Sure. Thanks, Elyse. I think it\u2019s important. I think as you were describing just now to decompose the parts of the expense ratio. I think if we look at the operating expense ratio that 5.9. I think that 5.96, et cetera, it\u2019s going to be pretty consistent for us. One of the things that you know about Everest and our company, it\u2019s our disciplined expense management, whether it\u2019s COVID or no COVID. The reality is we are pretty focused on being efficient. So I would expect that the operating expense ratio would be relatively consistent with those numbers that you have been seeing. The commission ratio is going to fluctuate based on the type of business that we are writing in any given quarter, right? And so, for instance, if you are writing on the primary Insurance business, lines that are growing faster but you are getting better seeds because of our Reinsurance structure that obviously will have an impact. On the Reinsurance side, obviously, the business mix that we write at the 1.1 renewals will also have an impact on that. But let me ask Mark Kociancic to weigh on that as well. Mark Kociancic : Yeah. I would echo that, Elyse. I think that expense run rate is going to be hovering around that 6 points. You might see some quarterly volatility. But in general, that\u2019s roughly the area I would expect it to go. There could be awaiting differential depending on the growth rate of Insurance, which comes with a higher general expense operating rate versus the Reinsurance Division. And then the other piece that I would just highlight is we are having a fairly strong net earned premium growth as we develop both franchises even more. So, these are things we are all keeping an eye on. So we wouldn\u2019t get caught up in quarterly volatility, but that run rate of 6 is a pretty good bogey. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Elyse. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Phil Stefano : Yeah. Thanks and good morning. We have been spending a lot of time with the first quarter earnings call, talking about the concept of rate adequacy. And I was hoping you could give us your thoughts on just the proportion of business that feels rate adequate or the extent to which we are rate -- we are reaching rate adequacy and pricing momentum may start to decelerate, and of course, the offset to that could be exposure growth as the global economy starts to recover in the back half of the year and overall what this could mean for potential topline growth? I mean it\u2019s more of an Insurance question than Reinsurance question, but appreciate whatever color you have. Juan Andrade : Great. Phil, thank you for that. Let me start with the topline growth question and then we will come back to the margin expansion point that you had. As I mentioned in my commentary and the script, one of the things that we are starting to see is a slow and steady return of exposure growth. It is starting to get near pre-pandemic levels. And I think that\u2019s something that, as well as the economic recovery is consistent, you are going to continue to see probably for the back half of the year. So I think that obviously bodes well for the Insurance industry as we are creatures of an economy and as there is more to ensure if more opportunity for growth. So I think again in the back half of the year, if exposure growth continues, you are going to see improvement in that. With regard to rate adequacy, et cetera, we have been seeing rate exceeding our expectations for loss cost trend now for a number of quarters, and obviously, it\u2019s going to vary by line of business. But you are starting to see where the majority of your lines of business are rate adequate at this point in time. Now that being said, it\u2019s important also keep in mind the starting, particularly for some of the longer tail lines, such as general liability, excess and maybe some of the D&O lines, where they may be needed more rates as an industry over time and we are starting to catch up and we are starting to get there. Now what you see in our numbers, frankly, is that, we have that steady improvement of underlying profitability continue to improve. As I have just mentioned to Elyse a few minutes ago, we are holding the line on our loss picks. We expect that over time we will be bringing that to the bottomline. But all of that bodes very well for expected margin growth over time. But let me also ask Jim Williamson to weigh in on this question. Jim Williamson : Yeah. Phil, the only thing I would add. I think, Juan covered it really well, is just the idea that when you -- we are very disciplined underwriters. And so when you see us moving our topline the way that we have in the last several quarters, I think that\u2019s a very clear indication to you that we feel great about the trades we are making, both in Insurance and Reinsurance. I mean, we would not be putting up that type of growth if we didn\u2019t feel very good about adequacy levels and that\u2019s probably the best indication that we can give you. Phil Stefano : Okay. No. I appreciate that. Right. So my follow-up is going to be dialing in on the workers\u2019 comp line. So we have now got four consecutive quarters of material declines. How should we think about the impact of remixing the book of business versus exposure versus price? And what has caused this line to come down and how should we think about this line in particularly as we move forward? Is it economically sensitive or is price just not have it at a rate adequate point where you feel comfortable turning the valve on and growing that business? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Great. Thanks, Phil. Let me start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in on this call. Look, the first thing I would say is, we like workers\u2019 compensation and we are experts at it at Everest. But we are also disciplined underwriters. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we see better pricing opportunities in other lines of business right now, property, D&O, specialty casualty. Those kinds of things. As I also mentioned, we are still writing comp. We are just changing the type of comp that we are writing going forward. Where we see less attractive pricing right now is in the monoline workers\u2019 compensation space. So as a result of that, we have really shifted more toward loss rateable, loss sensitive business at that point. But as I also mentioned in my remarks, we are very much looking for the opportunities as the economy begins to heal and as things begin to improve. We will see an improvement in exposures also in the workers\u2019 compensation line for us and when we see the opportunity and the pricing improving, firms improving, exposures beginning to grow, you will see us start to deploy more capital into workers\u2019 compensation as well. But, look, this is how we are managing this company proactively, presumptively to focus on lines with better rate adequacy, with better opportunities for growth and with better margin. But, again, we like comp, we are just taking a pause on it right now from the perspective of monoline until we see conditions begin to improve. But with that, let me ask Mike Karm to jump in. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I think only to follow-up, I think, that was well said is, we have been obviously managing overall exposure down as exposure growth is also shrunk as well. But the reality is we are starting to see that bottom out and to the point that was made by, Juan, as we start to see that opportunity, particularly pick up. I think we will cease that opportunity. We have been basically focused in the composition of the portfolio, really around low and moderate type hazard risk And so we feel very good about where we are and we are starting to see signs particularly outside of California where rate is starting to go up and nudge up and in California, we are seeing it starting to bottom out. But we are optimistic that, that toward the end of the year should start to change in California and that when the opportunity presents itself, you will see us certainly continue to gain some market share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Mike Phillips : Good morning and thanks for the time guys. Kind of a follow-up to an earlier question, I think, one of the first questions on Insurance margins and just kind of want get a little more clarity on it. Juan, you mentioned, the year-over-year increase -- the year-over-year improvement in interest on loss ratio to 64.3% and you talked about how the loss trends are making things a little more cautious on your part. I guess is that way for the first time in over a year we saw an increase in the loss pick from -- sequentially from the prior quarter. It\u2019s been coming down over quarter over quarter over quarter and this quarter it went up from 4Q. Is that simply yet because of your concerns on loss trends or is there anything else going on that would make your increases from 4Q? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. I would start with saying, look, the appropriate comparison is more of a year-over-year comparison than the sequential comparison and that\u2019s going to be driven more by mix of business than anything else. So I think that\u2019s an important point. The second point that I would make is, look, we feel pretty good about the business that we are writing today, about the rate adequacy on that business and about the margin that we are building. My comments about holding the line on loss picks are really pretty straightforward. It\u2019s the fact and I have been pretty consistent in this messaging over the last number of quarters. In this business you got to wait for things to season out over time and so in the meantime, it\u2019s not just about rate, it\u2019s about all those actions that we are taking on the underwriting side, portfolio management, limit management, attachment points, et cetera, to continue to improve the profitability in the quality of your book and that is what you are seeing. Those are the numbers that are being reflected not only in this quarter but in the last several quarters as well. And so going forward, we do believe we are building expected margin in those lines. And as we start getting more certainty on the fact that rate has indeed exceeded our trend expectations that margin will start coming through the bottom line basically. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thanks, Juan. Switching it then to capital, I guess, as last quarter, you hadn\u2019t deployed the $1 billion of debt and you mentioned here today that you have put some new deployment in the current -- new capital in the Reinsurance, I might have missed if you said anything on Reinsurance. But can you just tell us where you are with that $1 billion that you did back in October and where that stands today and how do you see that kind of being deployed this year, maybe more in gross or coming back a bit to anything else that you might do with that? Thanks. Mark Kociancic : Yeah. It\u2019s -- Mike, it\u2019s Mark speaking. So first of all, the -- we still have ample room to deploy the capital. It\u2019s not fully deployed. But there is no constraints in terms of our growth expectations this year our ambitions on both the underwriting side and on the investment side. So I\u2019d say, we are just looking for the best opportunities in the execution of our plan and capital is not a constraint either in the execution of the business or on the capital management side in terms of buybacks or dividends. Juan Andrade : Yeah. Mike and what I would build on Mark\u2019s answer is, remember what we said back in October when we did the debt raise, it was purely opportunistic, right? We have plenty of capital to be able to deploy. And so, as Mark said, and I will affirm that, we are seeing great opportunities in this market. You are seeing the continued momentum on the topline in both Reinsurance and Insurance, and we feel pretty good about the capital backing all of that. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you, Juan. I appreciate it. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Yaron Kinar : Good morning. My first question, I hope that you will be willing or able to answer it. I am going to give it a shot. I am looking at the slowdown in rate improvement 500 basis points quarter-over-quarter in Insurance. I am looking across some of your competitors, it sounds like there is a pretty wide range there of the rate of slowdown. And I am just trying to understand what would drive one company\u2019s slowdown to be greater than anothers? Is it a business mix, are you accounting for rate in a different way? Any help there that you can offer in looking at those -- this wide variance of trends would be helpful? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Yaron, happy to give you a perspective and then I will invite Jim Williamson to jump in as well. Look, starting with Everest, and as I mentioned to Elyse earlier in the call, 16% is very good. It continued significant momentum on the rate side of things. Business mix certainly will influence that, the type of business that you write in a particular quarter. For instance, in this case, if it\u2019s more heavily weighted toward a property a short line type exposure, that carries a certain rate, that\u2019s certainly going to impact the mix. Now, if I elevate the answer to your question and basically then talk more about the industry and look across companies, I think, again, business mix plays a part of that. I think execution place part of that, right? I think one of the most important things about our primary Insurance business and I talk about it often, I am very proud of them is how well they execute in the market. So I would say business mix is part of that, execution is part of that, portfolio management and how you look at risk is certainly part of that, and ultimately, risk selection which is a component of that. I think those are all the things that essentially go into play. But look, speaking from our perspective about Everest, we expect continued momentum and strong renewal rate growth throughout 2021. Jim Williamson : Yeah. Not a lot to add, Yaron. Other than to say, when you start looking across companies, just to give you a sense of how we think about it within our own portfolio. I mean, obviously, we are well aware of the topline number for our Insurance Division, for example. But we really do look at it a much more granular level because of all the reasons that Juan sighted. And at the end of the day, we have got underwriters they have -- they are approaching the market in a very disciplined fashion. But they are selecting one deal at a time. They are focused on making sure they underwrite the deal appropriately that they attach the right terms and conditions to drive the total margin outcome and so it\u2019s really only a debt level that the numbers are truly meaningful. So I would just be -- I\u2019d just be careful about reading too much into the fact that there is variation across firms. Yaron Kinar : Yeah. That\u2019s fair. I appreciate the thoughts there. And then if I -- for my second question, if I could shift to a Reinsurance segment, helpful color around April renewals, just curious, as we are starting to look at 6.1 renewals and the turmoil in Florida. How do you see the potential for growth there, I mean, we are hearing that there is a lot of need for rate on the one hand, much more involved in citizens and cat bonds on the other hand. So what opportunity exists there as far as you can tell today? Juan Andrade : No. That\u2019s great. And I will invite John Doucette to jump into this question, please. John Doucette : Yeah. Good morning, Yaron. Thank you for the call. So we are -- as you said, we had a good April 1, renewals. We are looking at not only June 1, but July 1, where we kind of finish out the treaty year. So our expectation is, we will be deploying about the same amount of capacity. And we will be focused on pushing rates, terms, conditions, because there are a lot of moving parts, social inflation, the climate change, the assignment of benefits issue. So our view is our book will probably be similar to last year and we will look to improve the economics. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from BofA. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I will stick with Reinsurance. So the -- and then sort of a question getting up the loss ratio underlying didn\u2019t improve all that much year-over-year, but of course, the expense ratio did. And I look at the business mix a lot of non-catastrophe, XOL business written, I think there\u2019s a lot of business mix. Of course on Reinsurance, there is very different acquisition cost, different types of businesses. Can you talk a little bit educate us on cat versus non-cat property versus casualty on how the acquisition cost differ between XOL and pro rata, that kind of explains what\u2019s going on I guess in the combined ratio which improved very well during the quarter? Juan Andrade : Great. Thanks, Josh. And I will ask John Doucette to please answer this. John Doucette : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Josh. So, yes, you are right, it is a business mix issue, a combination of -- and we do have different commissions and expenses, whether it\u2019s an excess of loss or pro rata. But it\u2019s more nuance from that. Really it -- there are deals that have very low commission structures, certain lines of business that the commissions even though they are on a pro rata basis. The commissions given it\u2019s a function of the loss ratio is a lot lower and closer to an excess of loss business. So it really has to do with the mix and it also has to do with, we did see some improvement in ceding commissions on proportional deals, particularly on the property side where we need -- where the ceding commission is a function, is effectively rate change and so some of the proportional deals that needed some improved economics from a Reinsurance point of view. We did see some downward pressure on the ceding commissions that then flowed into the numbers you are seeing today. Josh Shanker : So if I want to extrapolate the first quarter result into the full year, you write the most amount of premium Reinsurance in the first quarter. Are the changes we are seeing year-over-year in the first quarter indicative of how the loss ratio and expense ratio might play out as we move across 2021? John Doucette : So I think the best estimate of where the loss and expense ratio would be this quarter, yes. Josh Shanker : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Meyer Shields : I know you touched on this, but when I look at the non-acquisition expenses in Reinsurance. So we saw a pretty big jump on a year-over-year basis and I was wondering is that tied to mix also or are there other factors driving that? Juan Andrade : Meyer, just to make sure I understand your question correctly, are you looking at the non-acquisition expenses so are you focused on the 2.9? Meyer Shields : Yeah. The ratio was flat, but the dollars were up a lot. Juan Andrade : Yeah. So I think there\u2019s a couple of things play here. Number one, I think, as Mark mentioned, we certainly are seeing a benefit from earned premium growth coming through as a result of the business that we have been writing, and frankly, the success that we had last year in growing the franchise. If you recall, we grew that franchise by about 15%. So you are seeing the benefit of that coming through. Specifically to the dollars being up in the quarter on the Reinsurance segment, I think, a lot of that is frankly noise, as Mark said earlier. There\u2019s always going to be a bit of volatility in the expense ratio from quarter-to-quarter, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. But as both Mark and I said earlier, when you think about the operating expense ratio, trajectory, you know that 2.9, 3 is probably a good number for Reinsurance. Mark, I don\u2019t know, if you would like to add anything? Mark Kociancic : Yeah. I will just build off that a little bit because I think Juan captured it. I think for this quarter you are seeing a slight elevation just in terms of the volatility. I know there was very strong earned premium growth in Reinsurance, so perhaps it could have been less than 2.9. But there is nothing fundamental in there, you will still see this -- we should be coming in less than 3 for the year. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then a big picture question, I can\u2019t remotely disagree with the rationality of rate increases slowing down as more business achieves adequacy. But the history of this industry is that second derivative continues and eventually becomes disruptive, this is non-Everest question, but as a reinsurer you talk to a lot of companies and Everest has been focused on relationships. Is there any reason to be more optimistic about the post-hard market phase of the cycle whenever that emerges? Juan Andrade : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. I think you are getting into psychology now, Meyer, not the Insurance, Reinsurance economics. But, look, I think from my perspective, there is a number of things that might be slightly different, right? If you look at the underlying conditions that drove the need for rate, right? So a number of years of soft pricing, inadequate pricing, inadequate rates, et cetera, that finally began to turn as you had the impact of the catastrophes in 2017,2018,2019, as you had the impact of social inflation coming through. Now you have the impact of the COVID pandemic and the correlated impact on both the asset and the liability sides of the business. So all of these things are at play, right? And I think, what you found is that, people have achieved some level of discipline and you are hearing it from us certainly, you have certainly heard it from our peers, particularly on the Reinsurance side that they have all approached to 1-1 renewals with a level of discipline. Frankly from some of our competitors that maybe we haven\u2019t seen that level of discipline in the past. So I am an optimist and I think that some of that will continue as we go forward. There\u2019s also been capital that\u2019s coming in into the market, into the industry. But that capital has only been impacting on the margins and nibbling on the edges, so it has not been a significant amount of capital. So look, I think you still have some of the underlying factors to drove the need for rate. Rates are getting more adequate, as I mentioned earlier. But again, there\u2019s still environmental issues that we all need to keep an eye on, particularly the more disciplined companies like Everest I think will be very focused on that going forward. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Meyer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I guess the first question I am just curious in the Insurance segment, the acquisition expense ratio, you talked about better kind of ceding commissions benefiting the acquisition expense ratio. Is that a kind of a function of kind of changes in your Reinsurance buying philosophy and should we continue to see that lower kind of acquisition cost benefit ratio going forward? Juan Andrade : Yeah. So let me start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in. I think a big driver of that, Brian, was really the business that we wrote in the quarter and how that business then fits into the Reinsurance structure that we have in place. So I think that\u2019s part of that. I think the other part of that is that our reinsurers for the primary business are seeing and have seen the quality of the portfolio and the quality of the book that we have put together and so because of that, we are able to get slightly higher seed commissions on that business. But let me turn it over to Mike and he can add some additional color and context. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. So I think definitely business mix to Juan\u2019s point, it\u2019s certainly a factor in that as you saw like excess cash in some areas we have had significant growth that we are getting a little bit of the benefit of that. Also there\u2019s a little bit of us shifting to some of the more open market from programs, that growth in that business mix again will play into that. And then finally, what I\u2019d say, you probably see us as we continue to gain scale, be less dependent, we tend to be very conservative and basically buying Reinsurance, and so I think you will see that net to gross number change as well as we continue to kind of evolve. But in general, I think, that the business mix is mainly a bit much driver for the quarter. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And the second question I have I know it\u2019s really early in the process here, but just wanted to ask a quick question about taxes here and the discussion about corporate income tax rates going up and particularly the GILTI tax. Does the GILTI tax have a big asset for you guys and how should we kind of think about that in the event that we do get some big changes in the GILTI tax? Mark Kociancic : It\u2019s premature to say how that\u2019s going to play out for us. Right now I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what we see on the table from the administration or at least public dialog is not good for the in general. But I don\u2019t think it will have a material impact on us in terms of the way we are organized. So I would expect it to be marginal if something like that is implemented in the fall. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to management for closing comments. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you. Everest is well-positioned for this market and for the opportunities we have seen and improving economy. Despite the material, social and economic impact of the COVID pandemic, we continue to grow unimpeded, recruiting top talent and delivering value to our stakeholders. We have leading financial strength, a preferred market presence and a diversified global platform. We are nimble. We have deep distribution relationships, great people and a great culture. I am very excited by the opportunity ahead of us and I believe we are well-positioned to excel. Thank you for your time with us this quarter and for your continued support in the company. We will talk to you after the second quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Jon Levenson : Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest delivered an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and excellent underwriting and investment performance. We set multiple records for our company on both the top and bottom lines. These results serve as the foundation for our exceptional net income result of over $1 billion through the first half of 2021 and there are another important step towards achieving our three year strategic plan objectives and the delivery of superior results to our shareholders. Everest achieved an annualized total shareholder return of 22.5% through the first half of 2021 while exceeding our three year strategic plan target of 13%. We capitalized on market opportunities to expand our franchises in both reinsurance and insurance driven by relentless execution and the strength of our value proposition to our clients and brokers. Disciplined underwriting drove strong profitability in both reinsurance and insurance in our investment return was a quarterly record for the company. The standout performance this quarter demonstrate the progress we have made in executing our strategy and the quality of Everest diversified earnings. As I discussed at our Investor Day in June, our strategy has three building blocks. First is building our underwriting franchises. We are growing our Specialty P&C Insurance platform while expanding its margins. We are, solidifying our leadership position in global P&C reinsurance while we are growing and diversifying this business. Our investment portfolio is a core tool to generate solid returns and we're optimizing the portfolio while sharpening our strategy. Second, we continuously pursue operational excellence this starts with underwriting discipline, supported by system of management oversight and checks and balances beyond underwriting, we are transforming the operating model of the company to achieve greater scalability over time. We are also optimizing capital within our underwriting and investment portfolios. Capital is valued and respected. We are using the most efficient sources of underwriting capital from the capital markets including the ILS investors. In our industry those who execute best win. We're leveraging our flat agile organization to deliver best in class service and risk solutions to our brokers and customers. They routinely side our responsiveness and capabilities as a key reason why they choose to do more business with Everest. Finally, ESG principles are core of the Everest. This includes focusing on the culture of our company. Culture is one of our key differentiators and it is one of the reasons we can attract and keep top talent. Our culture fuels our success by helping our team be the best it can possibly be. We're investing in the talent of the organization as well as the diversity of our team. At Everest, we have three drivers of earnings. The first driver is about building a high-quality specialty commercial P&C insure the run underwriting excellence and a compelling value proposition. We are embedding data and analytics across the organization, enabling more effective pricing and decision-making, this means we make better underwriting decisions at improved loss ratios. We are improving our claims outcomes while delivering excellent service to our clients. And we're focusing our distribution efforts to be more sales and results oriented. Our second driver of earnings is average leading global P&C reinsurance platform. We enjoyed a leading market position of a fully scaled platform and we are focused on continuing to grow and optimize our reinsurance business. We are executing an underwriting transformation by improving operational oversight, governance and controls. Our Reinsurance Division is entrepreneurial and nimble, we will maintain it within a framework of pricing, reserving and process discipline. We're further diversifying into higher margin opportunities. And finally, we're expanding our risk financing by further partnering with capital markets and ILS investors. The third core driver of earnings is the investment portfolio. We have a high quality portfolio and we're focused on the efficient use of capital. The successful execution of our strategies in all three drivers of earnings is clearly evident in our results. I will now discuss our Group Reinsurance and Insurance First Quarter 2021 results. Starting with the Group results, we grew gross written premiums by 35% and net written premiums by 39%. Our growth was broad and diversified, stemming from one increased exposures and new business opportunities as the US economy recovers. Two, continued double-digit rate increases three expanded shares on attractive renewals and four, strong renewal retention. The combined ratio was 89.3% and eight point improvement year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.6% almost a full point, better than prior year with both segments expanding margins. We generated $274 million an underwriting profit compared to $51 million in the second quarter last year. Underwriting profitability remains at the core in everything we do. Net investment income was simply outstanding at $407 million compared to $38 million in the prior year second quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $680 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of over 28%. Gross written premiums and reinsurance were up 40% over the second quarter of 2020, we are pleased with the ongoing execution of our 2021 plan. This growth was broad-based in the areas we discussed during our Investor Day as attractive. We achieved this growth while also coming off or reducing shares are less attractive business. We drove continued targeted growth in property CAT which we achieved while lowering our PMLs in peak zones, thus reducing expected volatility and improving risk adjusted economics. Much of our growth came from our core trading partners that are looking to grow with Everest because of our strong ratings and balance sheet, significant capacity and the ability to right across all lines. The attritional combined ratio ex-COVID 19 pandemic impacts was 86.1 for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, resulting from our continued focus on loss and expense management. We see risk adjusted returns expanding in almost all treaties and classes of business globally. We're also benefiting from investments in data and analytics. As you can see in our results, our focused actions, improve the quality and profitability of the book. We are writing a more balanced portfolio with improved economics at an appropriate level of risk. We have achieved improved portfolio economics across all of our 2021 property renewal dates. We improved in every dimension, we increased topline, increased margin and achieve higher ROEs. In casualty and professional lines primary rate increases continue to outpace expected loss trends. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Our insurance division continued its strong performance with excellent growth and underwriting results. We continued to expand margins as we execute our strategy. We wrote over $1 billion in gross written premiums for the first time in a quarter. This represents 25 percent growth year-over-year or 30% growth excluding workers' compensation. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, continued double-digit rate increases and strong renewal retention on existing business. We're also starting to see a steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified and target classes of business where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability, property, transactional liability and trade credit and political risk. We are pleased with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. We also delivered strong underwriting results with a 93.5% combined ratio. A 10 point improvement over the same period last year, which was impacted by COVID. The underlying performance was also excellent with a 92.1 attritional combined ratio, a 1.6% improvement over last year and almost 4 points better than the second quarter of 2019. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend of 14% in the quarter excluding workers' compensation and up 11% including workers' compensation. Rate increases were led by excess casualty up 22%, property up 16%, financial lines up 14% and general liability up 9%. We are building a diversified portfolio, steering our mix towards product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continued to manage average limits deployed to mitigate volatility. We are pleased with the progress we have made and the strategic direction and granular portfolio management should continue to possibly impact our results going forward. We continue to thoughtfully manage to workers' compensation line, which now represents 10% of our second quarter premiums, down from 14% year-over-year. While this line remains profitable we have pared back monoline guaranteed cost writings and shifted to more loss sensitive, loss ratable business where we share more risk with our customers with more focus on risk mitigation. Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Everest and we're monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate our disciplined cycle management. Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continues to give us access to a wide opportunities. Michael Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. In summary, Everest had an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and exceptional underwriting and investment performance. We have a vibrant and well diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. We have significant momentum as we continue to execute our strategic plan. The company has excellent financial strength top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth. A more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategy will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident that Everest future and our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark. Mark Kociancic : Thank you. Juan, and good morning everyone. Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021 with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns, I'll provide more detail on these points over the next few minutes. The second quarter of 2021 Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion, representing 35% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 40% to $2.1 billion and Insurance reported its first ever $1 billion topline quarter representing 25% growth year-over-year. Turning to net income for the second quarter Everest reported net income of $680 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 28%. We also reported net operating income of $587 million equal to operating earnings of $14.63 per share and an annualized operating return on equity of 24.5%. All three of our earnings engines provided meaningful contributions with significant underwriting income from both our reinsurance and insurance franchises capped off by net investment income of $407 million, a record quarterly net investment income result. The underwriting income during the quarter of $274 million reflects Everest disciplined execution of our strategy to grow and expand margins, combined ratio was 89.3% for the quarter compared to 97.5% last year. Catastrophe losses during the quarter, of $45 million or pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums with $35 million in the reinsurance segment and $10 million in the insurance segment representing additional IBNR provisions for winter storm, Uri. The Reinsurance segment cat loss includes a provision for minor events and preliminary IBNR for the European convective storms of late June. Finally, I know we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision which remains at $511 million with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the second quarter excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact. The attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.3% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 60% in the second quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.5% compared with 60.7% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio for the Group was 87.6% for the second quarter compared to 88.5% for the second quarter of 2020 representing a 0.9 point improvement. Year-to-date attritional combined ratio for the Group was 87.4%, compared with 89.1% a year ago, representing a 1.7 point improvement. Our insurance the attritional loss ratio improved to 64.2% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with 65.1% year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.1% as compared to 93.7% for the same period of time. Our US Insurance business, which makes up the majority of our insurance business overall continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high '80s. For reinsurance the second quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.1% compared with 58.2% a year ago. The increase was due to a mix of business shift and more prudent initial loss picks. The attritional combined ratio was 86.1% for the second quarter, down from 86.7% for the second quarter of 2020. The group commission ratio of 21.8% for the second quarter of 2021 was down 100 basis points from 22.8% reported in Q2 2020 largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix. The expense ratio remained low over 5.5% for the quarter as compared with 5.8% reported a year ago and the expense ratio continues to benefit with our continued focus on expense management and the increased scale and efficiency of our operating model. For the second quarter investment income had an exceptional result of $407 million as compared to $38 million for Q2 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $266 million of income during the second quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments and as a reminder, we report our LP income one quarter in arrears. And in 2020 the market and the world we're starting to experience the impact of COVID 19 while so far in 2021 results continue to benefit from economic and financial markets recovery. Invested assets at the end of the second quarter totaled $27.1 billion compared to $21.6 billion at the end of Q2 2020 and 25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.6 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other investment assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective tax rate on operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 9.3% and 10.6% on net income, this was a favorable variance versus our estimated tax rate of approximately 11% based on the geographic distribution of income. For the first six months of 2021 Everest generated a record $1.6 billion of operating cash flow compared to $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020 reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains very strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter 2021 compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. We repurchased $16.8 million of shares in the quarter. Our debt leverage ratio is 13.3% or approximately 15.5%, inclusive of our $310 million short-term loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Book value per share was $260.32 at the end of the second quarter compared with $241.57 at the end of Q1 2021 reflecting dividend adjusted growth of 8.4% and I'll close with one final number. The total shareholder return or TSR target that we detailed in our Investor Day a few weeks ago. Recall that TSR is defined as the annual growth in book value per share, excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity investments, plus dividends per share and for the year to date the TSR number is 22.5% annualized. And with that, I'll now turn it back to John. Jon Levenson : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question, plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please ask your question. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question was on the reinsurance underlying loss ratio. So, you guys mentioned that the increase in the quarter reflects business mix and more prudent and loss picks, I was hoping to just get some more color there. And then how should we think about the loss ratio kind of trending forward from here. Juan Andrade : Yes, thanks. Elyse. This is Juan. So let me start out with that and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some additional color specific to your question on the loss ratio. Now, I would start off by saying that Reinsurance reported I think a very strong 86.1 attritional combined ratio in the quarter and 85.8 year to date and we achieved at the underwriting discipline, strong market conditions and a prudent loss picks selection. You've heard us talk about our strategy and the disciplines, we're implementing that squarely focused on continuing to drive world-class margins. But with that, let me ask Jim to give you some additional color on what drove the loss ratio. Jim Williamson : Yes, sure. And thanks for the question. Elyse, I mean the first thing I would say, and this is very consistent with the way we've described our value proposition and our strength in the market and that's that we're very nimble in this market, we have portfolios and markets around the world across many lines of business and we look to trade in into those various areas to maximize our total economic returns and that was certainly the case in the second quarter. And you see it in terms of some of our line of business growth where areas like pro rata casualty, were up 64% just incredible results we saw a lot of great opportunities to expand participation with some of our core partners and we took advantage of that. Conversely property cat XOL, which is a line of business where you have a big appetite for, it's a very, very attractive line grew at 17%. So, an excellent result. But obviously lower growth and that's aligned with a very low attritional loss ratio and so mix is absolutely going to play a factor there and it's going to bounce around from quarter to quarter depending on where we see opportunities emerging in the market. So those trades very successful outcome for our company. And then, the next piece around loss picks and again a lot of consistency from us on this topic is we set very prudent loss picks and in particular, if you think about the environment we're trading in with inflation, social inflation, the reopening from COVID, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market in, particularly in some of the longer-tail lines like casualty pro rata where we're growing, our view is we really need to see the results of rate change and the results of underwriting actions by our seems to play through and mature in our book. And so you will expect, as we see those results come through we'll certainly be sharing those results, but it will take time given the nature of our business for that to prove itself. Juan Andrade : Elyse, and maybe if I could jump back, and this is Juan and just add a couple of quick things, one, I think we also recognize that by growing casualty pro rata, we're also seeing lower volatility then from the growth in Property cat XOL but also keep in mind, what's going on in the environment. So I think this goes directly to your question on expected margin and we are confident based on all our metrics that we're looking at that, we are building future expected margin not only reinsurance, but also an insurance. We're still seeing rate exceeding expected loss cost. From my prepared remarks, you heard about the improvement in economics that we have seen across the board in our renewals last year and this year, particularly in reinsurance. We're basically increasing our margins while lowering our exposure. And again, I point you to the fact that an 85 combined ratio for the year on an attritional basis for reinsurance is excellent. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then, my second question is on capital at your Investor Day in June you pointed to booking to increase your leverage as you work on your three year financial plan. So as we think about the leverage going up, I just want to get a better sense of timing. As you think about adding to your leverage, and as part of the answer to that question, would you guys consider adding to leverage to support capital return via potential share repurchases or would it just be coinciding with when you thought you needed more capital to support the strong premium growth. Mark Kociancic : Hi Elyse, it's Mark. Just a couple of points on that. So I think the primary focus of the capital structure is really to support the organic growth of the business and so we'd look at it in context of supporting the growth and also from an opportunistic point of view of taking advantage of good market conditions to issue that type of debt. So I do foresee that happening over the course of this three year plan I think it makes a lot of sense. Having said that, we are still committed to active capital management so that includes share buybacks, but that would be, what I would call a secondary consideration. It doesn't mean we can't do it simultaneously but the first part is really all about franchise expansion through organic growth. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your line is open, please ask your question. Michael Phillips : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start with comp Juan, I heard your comments in the opening on how you're making some changes in comp and more loss sensitive accounts. But I guess you know there's been a lot to talk of maybe we're starting to see a change in pricing there. I'm not so sure if that's materializing for you guys. I hope you maybe you can give some color on, specifically on California. If you back out the... the COVID impact of California, it looks like the current, the current accident years are still trending pretty well, pretty good margin there. So when we, guys, just curious what you're seeing there and if that's, if that's the case, should we expect to see a turn in the market, especially for your accounts that others are talking about. Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike. Thanks for the question and I'll give you some additional color and ask Mike to also jump in I start by agreeing with you. I mean, our comp business is still very profitable and I stated that also in our prepared remarks, but we are mindful of how we deploy capital and we do see that pricing has flattened in workers' compensation at this point. Actually, in June we saw it go positive for the first time, so we're looking at that closely and see if that's a hardening of things to come. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we'd like to comp business. But we're also smart about how we deploy capital and we're seeing frankly better return opportunities right now in other lines of business, which I quoted in my remarks, where we're seeing significant rate across the board, but we are starting to see not only the flattening. But again, I would point to the fact that in June, we also started to see positive rate across the board but let me ask Mike Karmilowicz to give you some additional color. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks, Juan. And thanks for the question. Yes. As Juan mentioned, this is a perfect example for cycle management and actually really fully focusing on where we see opportunity and we are starting to see that stabilize across the country, particularly in California. For the first time we think we're starting to see some pockets in green shoots and with exposure both coming on. we are encouraged by where it's going and ultimately, we think that will be prepared to take advantage of that. You also see our slowing down ultimately in our comp, as far as the first quarter over second quarter. We're starting to see some changes there. So we feel that there is going to be some change in the marketplace, particularly in California. Keep in mind too with California, some of the, some of the reports that just came out from some of the organizations around some underlying cost we've noticed too that some of the overall costs that are associated with, with such as reforms on pharmaceutical and other different things California's performed actually better from a loss cost perspective of some of these things. So, we think that by end of the year and on next year. Mike. We'll see some of the starting to benefit us and you'll see us go after the business if that opportunity presents itself. Michael Phillips : Okay, great. Thanks guys, thanks for all the details there. Second question, should we expect to see any uptick on the insurance side on the amount of business you want to. So just net to gross premiums we expect to see that to tick up over the next year. Mike Karmilowicz : Sorry, Mike. You cut out. Can you repeat the question. I'm sorry is this better. Can you hear me okay? Michael Phillips : Yes. Okay, good. Insurance net the gross premiums. We expect to see that to tick up over the next year or so. Mike Karmilowicz : Look, we have -- and you know we started a lot of segments over the years, we've been building this out organically. So we particularly trying to hedge ourselves with some of the Reinsurance in some of these clients we do. I think as you continue to see us gain scale we will definitely see the net tick up with to our growth over time. And as we continue to kind of take the lines in the market to use increase, you'll see that happen. Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike, I would add that we're feeling very confident about the underlying book in the insurance division and particularly in this environment with better pricing, better terms, I think you can expect to see some of that going forward. Michael Phillips : Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open, please ask your question. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. Two questions on reinsurance, and without naming names when you're growing as fast as you're growing, you need to be taking share from somebody else, who are the market participants? Again, without naming names but giving us a sense of what the market looks like who are by choice ceding share to growers like yourself right now would the marketplace looks like that's allowing you to take so much here? Juan Andrade : Yes. Sure, Josh. I appreciate the question. So what I would say is, and we've been very consistent about this, we trade with a fairly select number of core partners and that's what's really driving our growth, whether it's in property casualty in markets in the US or around the world and we are absolutely a preferred market for our clients, we're preferred because we're nimble because we're creative, because we distribute authority to our teams, they make decisions, they move quickly and we're benefiting from all of those things. And in this environment. I think for cedents who are sophisticated about their buying. They are absolutely looking to trade up in terms of the quality of their partners and we benefit from that and so what we're seeing on programs around the world is we are getting increased signings with our core partners because of our broad capabilities, we're also able to trade into deals with core partners that we may not have been on before. And then, obviously, as they introduce new programs into the market, we're able to participate there as well. And so we find this to be a very favorable competitive environment that way. Josh Shanker : And the second question, if you talk to a number of competitors in the marketplace, they tend to say that that the litigation environment is still come up from the pandemic, the frequency of reported loss is lower than it should be, but everyone's reserving for it with a I'd say that will accelerate as things sort of return to normal and some extent. As a reinsurer obviously, you're one step away from that and you're relying on the reporting of your students to help you frame your own losses. How does the gums up litigation environment inform how you are thinking your loss picks at this point and preparing for that future? Juan Andrade : Yes, it looks -- that's a very key point to make and it's an important trend and I think folks who expected some of the downturn and frequency of some of these losses during the period of COVID who thought that that would continue. I think that's a significant mistake. And our view has never been that we should react to that temporary environment and so we've held our loss pick study which is sort of where we started the Q&A today. And so that prudence really puts us in a strong position, as things start to unwind, and you do see a little bit more activity in terms of litigation and things of that nature, we don't have to react the other way either. So that prudence that consistency benefits us when you see these very short-term changes in loss trend, we have to really be picking our losses for the long-term trends that we're experiencing and those trends have not ceased just because of the temporary slowdown due to COVID. Josh Shanker : Have you seen any data that suggests this temporary slowdown as a person? Mark Kociancic : No, look, I mean in terms of the Reinsurance business to the point that you made in your question the lag of reporting in terms of hard data, it's certainly too early to tell, but obviously we're in constant communications with our cedents. And I would say folks are starting to see some of the results of the reopening we're certainly seeing it in areas like auto for example but that's in the realm of anecdote at this point, Josh. Juan Andrade : And, Josh, I would -- this is Juan. I would give you some color on the primary side where you are starting to see frequency come back to more normalized lever particularly around commercial auto general liability et cetera et cetera. So this goes back to the theory that we have since last year, which is the shutdowns and the lockdowns in the COVID pandemic did lead to a temporary change in frequency patterns maybe even severity patterns. But that's not going to be a steady state, I think you will see normalized frequency normalized severity come back. Josh Shanker : Thanks for the answers. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open, please ask your question. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you. Good morning. I'm asking this question not so much on the reserving side but from the underwriting side, the property pro rata book is growing. And what we've seen recently is obviously enormous volatility and loss trends for property lines, can you give us a sense in terms of how rapidly your cedents can can't respond to higher property losses with their pricing and underwriting? Juan Andrade : Yes, thanks for the question Meyer, what I would say is, you really have to break it down into its components and I think there are some areas, particularly in the commercial lines, which is really where our book is focused they can respond pretty quickly. And it's, it's a combination of obviously rate which we're seeing very strongly in the market, it's a combination of terms, conditions, attachment points, limits, our cedents and because we do partner with very high quality primary underwriters, they are absolutely aggressively addressing changing conditions in the underlying property market. And so I think it actually happens reasonably quickly. But again, and I hate to sound like a broken record on this, is why we do maintain prudency in our loss picks, because some of these things take time to unfold. And we want to make sure that they get proven out. The other piece that's important. When we think about our own profitability in property pro rata is obviously loss pick is critical, but we also look at things like ceding commission, and so we've seen improvements in terms there and that allows us to get to a place where the overall economics are very attractive and which is why we're willing to grow the line. Meyer Shields : Okay, that's helpful. And my next question with on ceding commissions. Are you seeing the same success in casualty you are in property with regard to I guess declining ceding commissions. Juan Andrade : Well, it's obviously a very different market and you hear a lot of the market commentary and you heard it from us. Regarding the rate changes that are happening in a lot of the casualty lines here in the US and around the world. And so to the extent that cedents believe they're creating margin they're obviously going to be seeking increased ceding commissions. We've seen a little bit of that activity. It's very modest at this point and I think for cedents who think about their reinsurers as long-term partners which really describes our core partners, the ones that we've grown with over the last couple of years -- I think they're very balanced about that. And so, while there is some upward pressure and you definitely see people seeking improved ceding commissions in the marketplace. It hasn't had a tremendous impact on our casualty business, we still see great opportunities to write new business, and to expand lines in that market and we expect that to continue. Meyer Shields : Perfect, thank you so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please ask your question. Philip Stefano : Yes, thanks and good morning of focused more so on the insurance side of how I was hoping you could help give us an impression of what inning we're in the business mix change benefit to the attritional loss ratio. I mean part of the question is that there has been a reticence to recognize the benefit of rate over trend in terms of conditions and et cetera. And I'm wondering if the attritional improvement slow down at some point once the business mix changes played out. But the recognition of the rate versus trend in other industry trends has not come through yet. Juan Andrade : Yes. Phil, this is Juan, and good morning. Also, let me start out -- please recall in, I think it was last quarter's earnings call where we talked about all the levers that we're using to improve the profitability and the margins in our insurance division, but also within reinsurance. Right. So it's not just really about mix, it's also about the granular detail of managing the portfolio of making tough decisions on what account you stay on, where do you want to grow and being very purposeful about shaping the portfolio and being able to grow it. If I look back at what we have been able to do in the insurance Division over the last 18 months, the numbers are pretty clear we have been able to lower the attritional combined ratio by about 6 points over that period of time. Since, really the end of 2019 and a lot of it has been these very presumptive actions on the lines of business that we choose to operate in, not operate in etc. The example workers' compensation that we talked about earlier to Mike's question I think is a perfect example of that, right. So that gives you a sense that while. Yes, we have been prudent in our loss picks because we view the environment as I said earlier, a temporary environment because of COVID with the frequency changes that we saw in that time, the reality is, there's a lot of work, beyond that and beyond mix that helps us to shape the portfolio going forward. But let me ask Mike Karm to give you a bit of additional yes, sure. Mike Karmilowicz : Thanks, Juan. Yes. So I think the short answer is that we still think we're in early innings. We started a lot of these businesses, we've seen obviously some of that improvement. Come through, and again this is dependent on what's happening in the marketplace. So as you can see, to see opportunity, and we see the opportunity get scale and continue to expand our footprint, I think you'll see some of this continue to play through over time. But again, we feel we're making great progress, but we're still in early innings. Juan Andrade : Phil, thank you. In the last comment I would make to that is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing rate very comfortably ahead of trend particularly in insurance. So when you think about the expected margin that's being built in addition to the actions that I described on the underwriting side, I think that gives you a sense of where this could be going. Mike Karmilowicz : And I think why it's a well for the last thing I'd say is we continue to hold the line on the loss picks for good reason, because we recognize it over time so I think you're seeing us do the prudent thing and do this in a long-term view. Philip Stefano : Thank you. I appreciate it. And so the second question, looking more on the capital management side of the house. And so the commentary, or at least some of the commentary has been around the fact that, look, we can grow organically very quickly, but that doesn't mean we can't repurchase shares concurrently with that growth. We've seen some other Bermuda plays the bit more active in the repurchase momentum just given where valuations are and maybe you can help us think through uses of capital, given where valuations are and maybe to put it more bluntly, why is now not a good time to really step on the gas with repurchases just given where the stock is trading? Mike Karmilowicz : Well, Phil, I mean it's a constant question for us because, look, step one is always supporting the franchise expansion, we're in the best market in almost a generation here. So we are privileging that growth you're seeing very strong top line growth on both segments Reinsurance and Insurance. Having said that capital management. We've been active. We could certainly be more active. I don't see any hesitation on our side to do that. I think you will see that in the future and we can complete both sides of that equation grow strongly without any constraints and manage our capital even more efficiently. Philip Stefano : All right. Well, looking forward to seeing it. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Phil. Operator : There are no further question at this time, I will hand the call over to the management. Juan Andrade : Great, thank you. Everest is a growing and leading global reinsurance and insurance company with a seasoned leadership team, broadly diversified earnings streams and a clear strategy to drive growth and expand margins while reducing volatility.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Levenson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Levenson : Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line growth across both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, continued to improve underlying profitability for our insurance segment, continued diversification of our reinsurance franchise, demonstrated strong expense discipline, delivered excellent investment income results, opportunistically reduced our cost of capital, and returned capital to our shareholders. We continue to execute our plans, regardless of the external environment. Before I get into the results, I want to first acknowledge the human cost of the catastrophes in the quarter. For those people whose lives have been affected around the world, by the wind, fire, floods and earthquakes experienced in the quarter, these are life changing events and this is always top of mind for us at Everest. As insurers and reinsurers, we are here, as these communities work to rebuild, recover, and hopefully emerge even stronger, and for Everest, this is when our ability to execute really matters. Turning to the results for the third quarter, the strength and resilience of our fundamentals continues to prove our strategy is working, and our execution is on pace. As we shared there in the June Investor Day, we measure our success against the three year strategic plan with a simple goal; create value and drive meaningful shareholder returns over time. This starts by ensuring that our reinsurance and insurance businesses supported by our investment portfolio are doing exactly what we said they would do, drive forward momentum to fuel profitable growth. On our core, Everest is a growth company focused on sustained profitability with a well-diversified earnings stream. Beginning with our insurance division, which delivered record high quarterly top line growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in gross written premium and the lowest attritional combined ratio to date, we continue to prove our relevance in the market and our ability to execute. There's significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably and we're capitalizing on it. We're well on our way to growing into the world-class specialty global insurer we've set out to be. Reinsurance delivered double-digit growth and we continue to further diversify our book across lines and geographies around the world, a key part of our discipline strategy to reduce volatility. This discipline was evident in the previously announced third quarter pre-tax net catastrophe losses of 635 million from Hurricane Ida and the July European floods, events totaling over 40 billion in industry insured losses. Everest is not immune to cat losses but the cumulative, deliberate and purposeful actions we have taken to reduce volatility have changed our company's risk profile. We have taken a disciplined approach to diversifying our book and reducing reliance on a single peak cap zone. For example, we have reduced our PMLs for southeast wind to almost half of what they were in 2017 from 11% to 5.9% of equity. We have scaled back our total property cat XOL premium, which comprises 17% of our total reinsurance premium today versus 26% at the end of 2017. Our book is better positioned and less volatile today than it was two years ago. We will continue to thoughtfully manage our risk profile to maximize returns. Turning to investments. Performance here was excellent. We continue to optimize our portfolio, and its earnings power as a key diversifier of our earnings. Prudent capital management is another important part of our strategy. Just after quarter end, we completed an opportunistic $1 billion debt raise at a three and an eight coupon. This is very efficient, long-term capital. In addition, we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the quarter for a total of $200 million year-to-date. If the engines of our strategy are our core underwriting platforms supported by our investment portfolio, our transformation efforts focused on operational excellence and underwriting discipline are the fuel for those engines. During a quarter when the industry sustained meaningful losses from catastrophes, this discipline made a material difference in our financial outcome. It is about commitment to consistent execution and building a company for the long term. Throughout the third quarter, we saw the benefit of this commitment manifest in several ways. We continue to prove we can play offense in a favorable market to pivot and respond to changing market conditions. We're executing on a value proposition that continues to be well received by our customer and broker partners. We have the talent and capabilities to deepen distribution relationships, and diversify our presence in key markets around the world. We have established our purpose-driven culture as a differentiator. We also see it in the top industry talent who have joined Everest, and who view the company as a great environment for development and opportunity. With that, let's dive into more detail around our results this quarter at the group and segment level. Beginning with our group results, growth in the third quarter continued to be strong and diversified across both of our businesses. We grew gross written premiums by 25%, a barometer of our market relevance. The increase in premiums was a product of our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions, driving exposure, growth and new business opportunities, the favorable double-digit rate environment and high renewal retention. The combined ratio of 112 include 635 million of pre-tax net catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida and the European floods during the quarter. The group attritional combined ratio of 87.9 reflects strong underlying profitability in insurance and our continued diversification in reinsurance, coupled with ongoing prudence in loss picks selection. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter resulted in an underwriting loss of 323 million. Net investment income for the quarter was again outstanding, up 25% to 293 million. And the expense ratio also improved this quarter. The meaningful progress this quarter is not a sprint, it's about consistency; day by day, quarter by quarter, being thoughtful and strategic about developing the portfolio, prudently managing expenses and pursuing overall operational excellence; these actions all add up. The cumulative effect is evident in our year to date results, and a few are worth highlighting now. Year-to-date gross written premiums are up 24%. Our business has continued to drive strong growth and momentum. We generated close to $1 billion in net income year-to-date. This is a testament to the earnings power of the company. Net investment income year-to-date has more than doubled from $420 million for the period last year to close to $1 billion today. Our expenses continued to improve and the group attritional combined ratio is also trending better year-to-date. Finally, for the nine months year-to-date, annualized total shareholder return on equity is over 13%. With that, I'd like to turn to the results in our reinsurance business. We had another excellent growth quarter in our reinsurance division with gross written premiums up 19%. We strengthened the franchise through underwriting actions to create a more diversified, resilient, and lower volatility business. The growth was broad and diversified, every geography and targeted line saw continued expansion in the quarter. The combined ratio of 115 includes the impact of third quarter pre-tax net catastrophe losses of 555 million from Hurricane Ida and the European floods. Our focused actions to de-risk our portfolio are reflected in these results. The share of our book exposed to Cat losses has declined. Diversification is key because the severity and frequency of these events are a reality. We see the impact of climate change in our data and we take a proactive and scientific approach to how we model and underwrite for it. Our dedicated team of experts continuously assess the science and integrate its effect on lost costs into our models. This focus will continue to be a key part of our strategy. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 87, including an attritional loss ratio of 60. Our attritional loss pick reflects our deliberate and targeted shaping of our portfolio to maximize results. This includes a higher mix of pro rata structures, and an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. These underwriting actions position Everest to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions achieved by a core seasons in the primary market. Combined with continued prudent loss picks, this result in a relatively higher attritional loss ratio, but with better long-term risk adjusted returns on capital. As you know, the primary market has benefited from multiple quarters of strong rate improvement, a reduction in limits and the strengthening of terms and conditions. Our strategy of focusing growth on core trading partners means we're benefiting from these effects alongside some of the industry's best underwriters, and we expect strong portfolio economics to emerge. Risk adjusted return expectations are improving in every line, in every geography. At the same time, we remain vigilant regarding market trends, including climate change, supply constraints, and social and material inflation. As a result, we continue to hold prudent loss fix. Finally, Mt. Logan continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have brought in John Modin as its new leader. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Now for our insurance division. Performance continued to be strong with exceptional growth and expanding underlying margins. In the third quarter, we wrote over 1 billion in gross written premium for the second quarter in a row and achieved the highest quarterly growth rate to date at 43%. The growth in insurance was fueled by a few factors. Number one, we continue to seize opportunities from increasingly favorable economic conditions. Second, we continue to grow through new business and demonstrate our relevance to customers and brokers. Third, we're benefiting from strong retention rates. This, coupled with continued favorable double-digit rate increases is creating the kind of opportunity Everest was built for and that we're poised to capitalize on. We maintain a strong focus on portfolio management as an important part of our strategy and driver of long-term profitability. We continue to proactively position the company to play offense and react nimbly to market conditions by driving our business mix stores product lines with better rate adequacy, and higher long term margins. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 12% in the quarter, excluding workers compensation and up 8% including workers compensation, which now represents 12% of our overall portfolio with model line comp down to only 7%. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 17% and financial lines up 14%. I've said it before, those who execute best in this business win and the quality of growth and insurance and our focused discipline comes down to simply excellent execution. During the third quarter, we expanded traditional underwriting margins with improvements in loss and expense ratios. This includes a 2 percentage point improvement in our attritional loss ratio of 62.9 and an improvement to 14 in the operating expense ratio. This resulted in the division's lowest attritional combined ratio to date at 90.3 and almost 4 point improvement over the same period last year. The underwriting loss of 17.2 million in the quarter was a result of the impact of pre-tax net catastrophe losses, including 80 million for hurricane Ida. However, the year-to-date underwriting profitability shows the indicative strength of our portfolio and ability to execute. We have a long runway in front of us, and we're investing in the talent, the systems and our worldwide capabilities to make us better, more efficient and more relevant in the market. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Reflecting on the progress we made against our long-term objectives, it is evident we're working with the right formula for success. Everest management team has the level of focus, deep expertise, and entrepreneurial approach to take us on our path forward and bring us even further. I am proud of the work we're doing building on a strong, inclusive culture that is constantly delivering for our clients and for our partners, pushing the envelope in digital innovation and our commitments as good corporate citizens. The opportunities are there, and Everest is well positioned to seize them. Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes but first, a recap of the third quarter results. For the third quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of 3.5 billion, representing 25.3% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 19.2% to 2.5 billion and insurance once again reported gross written premium of $1 billion in the quarter, representing 43.2% year-over-year growth. Year-to-date, the group's gross written premium was 9.6 billion, up 24.4% compared with the 7.7 billion figure from the first nine months of 2020. Turning the net income, net income results for the quarter were impacted by the global cat events seen worldwide, particularly hurricane Ida in the US and European flooding in Germany and Belgium. As a result, for the third quarter Everest reported a net loss of $73 million and a net operating loss of 53 million equal to negative $1.88 and negative $1.34 per share, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, Everest reported net income of 948 million and operating income of 795 million, equal to $23.72 and $19.87 per common share respectively. Everest reported 635 million in net catastrophe losses during the quarter, as detailed in our October 14 earnings press release. The manageable losses from these events are strong evidence of the material de-risking of the portfolio over the past few years that Juan described and as evidenced by our reduced PMLs. Importantly, these results were well within average expectations from events of this magnitude and within our risk appetite. We also note that there is no prior period development in the cat losses this quarter, all are current accident quarter events. Beyond Ida and the European floods, there were a number of smaller events which did not breach the Everest cat event threshold of $10 million per event. Our practice for reserving for these smaller events is to include them in our attritional loss ratio estimates. And as such, these events did not materially impact our Q3 attritional loss ratio selections. I also note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at 511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Third quarter results continued to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. For the group, our underlying attritional profitability remains strong during the third quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attrition total loss ratio for the group was 60.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 59.3% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.6% compared with 60.2% a year ago, reflecting our overall mix of business shifts to longer tail casualty lines. The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.9% for the third quarter compared to 85.8% for the third quarter 2020 and year-to-date, the attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% compared with 88% a year ago, as commission and expense ratio improvements offset the attritional loss ratio movements. For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 62.9% compared with 64.8% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved 3.9 points during Q3 to 90.3% as compared to 94.2% over the same period a year ago, given the favorable attritional loss ratio improvement and the reduced expense ratio. Our US insurance business which makes up the majority of the book continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. Turning to reinsurance, attritional losses in the reinsurance segment were largely driven by changes to the mix of business, notably proportionately more casualty premium plus 4.8% year-over-year. As a result, the third quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 60.2% compared with 57.5% a year ago, and the attritional combined ratio for reinsurance was 87.1% compared with 83% for the third quarter of 2020. The group's commission ratio of 21.2% for the third quarter was up 1 percentage point from 20.2% reported in Q3 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix with more pro rata property and casualty business, which has a higher commission ratio versus excess of loss. The group expense ratio was exceptional at 5.3% for the quarter, and down a full point as compared with 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management, and the benefits of increased scale and efficiency from our operating model. For the third quarter investment income once again produced an exceptional result of 293 million as compared to 234 million for Q3 2020. Alternative investments accounted for 170 million of income during the third quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments driven by the continued economic and financial markets recovery. As a reminder, Everest reports limited partnership income one quarter in arrears, so the current quarter results are based on the valuations as of June 30. Invested assets at the end of the third quarter totaled 27.8 billion compared with 27.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 25.5 billion at year end 2020. Approximately 78% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.3 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective taxes on net income and operating income for the third quarter of 2021 were negative 16.2% and negative 21.4% respectively. The variance from our estimated tax rate of 11% for the year was largely due to the geographic distribution of income impacted this quarter by the catastrophe losses which were primarily underwritten on our US domiciled entities. For the first nine months of 2021, Everest generated 2.8 billion in operating cash flow compared to 2.2 billion for the first nine months of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year, and we also note that operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at approximately 1.2 billion. The Everest balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities, shareholders' equity was just under $10 billion at the end of the third quarter, compared with 9.7 billion at year end 2020. Our attractiveness as a counterparty was endorsed by the markets, as evidenced by the debt raise in early October. Everest issued $1 billion of 31 year senior notes at a very attractive coupon of three and an eighth, lowering our cost of capital over the long term. With this additional capital, Everest pro forma financial leverage at the end of Q3 is just above 20%, in line with our long-term target of 15% to 20% and we will manage our leverage within this range as we continue to optimize our capital structure through the course of the strategic plan. And as with the offering from last year, we will deploy the proceeds into the business, given the organic growth opportunities highlighted in our strategic plan and the current favorable underwriting environment. Everest repurchased 625,000 shares in the quarter for a total of 160 million and year-to-date, the numbers are 791,000 shares and $200 million. Quarter-end book value per share was $253.40, compared with $260.32 at the end of the second quarter, resulting from 100 million in the change in unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio driven by changes in interest rates, plus the quarterly net income result. And I want to close with an update on our progress towards the Everest total return, or TSR target as detailed during our Investor Day. Through the third quarter of 2021, the TSR stands at 13.2% annualized, on track to meet the three year TSR target of at least 13%. The fundamentals of our long-term value creation plan remained strong, based on the diversified set of earning streams, reinsurance, insurance and investments along with an efficient capital structure. We affirm our strategic plan assumptions and TSR target over the three year timeframe as detailed in our June investor day. And with that, I'll now turn it back to John. Jon Levenson : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow up and then rejoin the queue, if you have any remaining questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on capital. So we saw your capital return on the buybacks pick up in the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of how we should think about repurchase is from here and is that dependent upon how market conditions evolve over the course of the next year? And then tying into that answer, can you just give us constant commentary about potential M&A would fit into any capital return decisions that you guys are making? Mark Kociancic : Thanks, Elyse. It's Mark speaking. So we did have a pretty meaningful share buyback this quarter. That's pretty much par for the course, given where we are with our strategic plan and very strong growth assumptions that you see there. Not much has changed, we are simply privileging organic growth, as we develop our franchise with our capital. We see very good conditions in the market in both reinsurance and insurance but the capital management side is something we can do alongside that expansion and so you'll continue to see share buybacks consistent with what we've done in the past moving forward, as time moves on. Regarding the M&A? Juan Andrade : So let me address that, Elyse and this Juan Andrade. Look, as I've said publicly before, M&A is certainly part of our toolkit. Now we prefer to build our businesses organically and we see great opportunities in the market right now to be able to do that as evidenced by the growth rates that we have posted, not only this quarter, but really on a year-to date-basis. But it is something that we look at and if we find the right opportunity to advance our agenda and advance our business, we will certainly take a look at that, but our strategy remains primarily focused on growing our business organically. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then my friend question, on an unwritten and earned basis in insurance, what's the GAAP versus loss trend right now? And how much more the book needs a season before you would take down your loss effect? Juan Andrade : Yeah, Elyse, this is Juan again. So look, I would say that, we continue to see very strong double-digit rate momentum, as we quoted in my remarks, plus 12 for the quarter. And essentially, every line of business right now, with the exception of workers comp, is ahead of trend and it has been for a number of quarters at this point in time, so we expect that to continue. The way we look at our reserving and again, I think I've been pretty consistent about this, since I started as a CEO here almost two years ago, is we're very disciplined. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are also cognizant of the external environment, whether it's social inflation, climate change, CPI type inflation and everything that's out there right now, so we do prefer to let things season over time before we take action and bring that down. However, you also saw in the insurance numbers this quarter, the improvement that we made in the loss ratio, and again, this is consecutive, to prior quarters as well. And I would point the fact to, again, statements I've made in the past, it's not only about rate, it's about all the management actions, day to day in the portfolio, how we look at individual books of business, how we shape that portfolio, how we manage that, how we focus our attention our execution on lines of business that we believe have a higher potential for long-term margins. So, all of that is built into that and essentially, that is what you see reflected in the improvement than the loss ratio on an underlying basis for the insurance division. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the color. Juan Andrade : Sure, Elyse. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Mike Zaremski : Great. Good morning. Maybe, on the reinsurance segment first, please. Thanks for the commentary about the change in business mix. So I guess I'm just wanted to be clear if should we be factoring in this kind of changing business mix in our - it's kind of a new baseline in our go forward, in terms of kind of the higher attritional ratio on some of the business you're putting on? It sounds like that that's the read through from the commentary on the call so far. Juan Andrade : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And again, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter, loss ratio this quarter, is really the result of deliberate actions that we're taking, right and those are deliberate actions to accomplish really three things. Number one, is to fully benefit from the strong market that we're seeing. We're seeing rates and long tail lines to be up, terms and conditions to have been improved, limits to have been shortened and so as a result of that, we're growing in our pro rata structures in casualty alongside some of the best underwriters in the primary market. You see it in the supplement. Our casualty pro rata business was up 63% for the quarter, so that's indicative of how we're playing offense and taking advantage of these market conditions there. The second thing for us that we're trying to accomplish is really, this is part of our deliberate strategy to reduce volatility, and diversify our book opportunistically, in the lines of business that we believe can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. That's the other part that you're seeing there right now. It's us purposefully moving our book of business in a direction that we believe will give us long-term risk adjusted returns on capital that are quite attractive. And the third part of it, and this is related to the answer that I just gave to Elyse, again, as I've said, from the beginning, we are a disciplined underwriting company and we do maintain prudent loss picks in light of the external environment. So what you are seeing is that, particularly the long tail lines will carry essentially higher loss picks than the short tail lines and as we move that business over, this is the end result that you will see, but with an outcome that we expect to return that much better margins in the future while reducing the volatility of the company. The bottom line is we feel very good about the portfolio that we're creating right now and the embedded margin that we're creating. And we also feel very good about this being able to achieve the targets that we laid out on Investor Day and that Mark just affirmed. Jim Williamson : Yeah, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. The only thing I would add to what Juan had said and really only to add some additional color is, we obviously are very close to our core cedants who are driving the really strong growth that we've had in areas like casualty pro rata. And when you unpack their results in terms of what they're seeing, from a rate change perspective, their ability to reduce limit profiles, to improve terms and conditions, these are not subtle changes, these will have a dramatic impact, obviously, on the quality of the book that we have today and we're very excited about that. And our expectation is that those conditions will persist. And so we want to continue to partner with those core cedants as they move through this market. But the last thing I would add, obviously, is we remain very flexible, and where we see good risk-adjusted returns, we're absolutely willing to shift our mix quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year and we will retain that flexibility as we move forward. Mike Zaremski : That's very helpful. Just one follow-up, so with this business, it sounds like it's going to result in the near term and obviously, I don't want to just focus on the near term, but in a slightly higher attritional loss ratio, is it more capital efficient to and that you can write more business versus the rest of the business? Or it really should we just be thinking this is just better long-term business and eventually, it'll probably come through over time in a better combined ratio, in matter of years. Jim Williamson : Yeah, sure. Mike, this is Jim again. So look, it is something we keep a very close eye on. We have a very disciplined capital allocation process within the company and for every line, we're continuously referencing back to how various lines of business consume capital and return on those lines. But this is not about trying to maximize top line. It's not a strategy related to that, it's really about pursuing best risk-adjusted returns. And in the market environment that we're moving in, we see a lot of excellent opportunity in the casualty lines and so it's about the pursuit of good bottom line performance, about good consistent results, about achieving our long-term strategic ambitions and about managing the volatility of the group. Those are really the decision factors that are driving the growth that we're seeing in casualty. Juan Andrade : Yeah, Mike, and I would just add to that. Look, this is part of when we talk about execution. This is a proof point and this is exactly what we're talking about that we identify an opportunity, we identified a core group of cedants that are driving this forward in a very positive way. And we see the economic benefit that can result for the company by partnering up with them. This is how we're driving our business forward. Mike Zaremski : Understood, good color. And one last follow up, given a lot of changes in business mix and some new management team members, I think, historically, there's been more - it looks like true ups on reserves at the end of the year in 4Q. Is that something we should be thinking about? Is there some type of kind of seasonality we should be thinking about, at the back half of the year, the back quarter of the year? Jim Williamson : Yeah, Mike, this is Jim, again. Thanks for the question. One of the things that we've talked about in the past is the work we're doing to continuously improve our approach to reserving and one of the changes that we've made coming into this year is we've rebalanced our reserve study calendar to move away from having so much activity in the fourth quarter. And so year-to-date, we've completed about half of the number of reserve studies that we plan on completing for the year. As we do every quarter, we're reviewing the results of those studies and we'll continue to do that. So it's absolutely something we're changing over time and I think you'll see us continue to make progress in the next year to create a more balanced level of activity across quarters. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Let me start first question on the ILS market, anything you've seen there from fund managers in terms of just changing appetite to continue supply, given what's been a pretty tough last couple years, and certainly this quarter? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Let me start and then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to add his point of view as well. Look, I think definitely, what we're hearing from investors, particularly post Ida and post the floods in Europe, is basically a bit of a concern about the catastrophe activity that's out there in the industry. You have also seen the fact that some of that money has moved more towards the cat bond market and towards very much higher up in structures and there are still appetite there. As a matter of fact, we saw a lot of capacity and attractive pricing, again, at the higher levels and at the higher attachment points, etc. But I think in general terms, I would say you probably are seeing a little bit of concern right now in the ILS market with some of these investors but I would ask Mark to also add his perspective on this. Mark Kociancic : Yeah, it's clear we've had underwhelming performance to say the least over the last few years in terms of cat activity, and the impact of climate change, I think is something that is still trying to be understood by the market in general. And then you've had examples of trapped collateral. And so I'd say that's somewhat slowed the inflow based on this recent history that we've seen, but, look, today's losses, I think, make morals pricing. And so I see this as kind of a cycle that will work its way out as information becomes clearer, terms become better and the volatility starts to reduce as a result of that better information entering the models. Juan Andrade : Mike, and I would finish up by saying, this also creates an opportunity for rated carriers like us. The reality is, there's going to be a lot more demand for companies with the financial strength and the ratings like government to continue to write business going forward. So while there has been maybe more of a muted concern that we're hearing, on the other hand, it also presents an opportunity for us on the front end. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate that. My second and final question. Juan, you mentioned, you're still seeing pretty good pricing in insurance ahead of loss trend, can you say you're assuming in on casualty loss trends in your advising? Juan Andrade : Well, it's typically not something that that we have disclosed publicly but what I can tell you, Mike, is that we review this on a quarterly basis, I think, as Jim was basically talking about, this is really part of the analysis that we do every day or every quarter. And, we drew this up for everything that we're seeing from the perspective of social inflation, that we see from the perspective of what we're seeing in wage inflation out there, etc., etc. and so we try to stay very much on top of that. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hi, guys. Good morning. First question, just thinking about your guidance for 7% cat load. The average cat load over the past five years has been 15%. Just curious, why do you still think that that's a prudent best estimate? Mark Kociancic : Well, so Ryan, it's Mark answering here. So, obviously, our cat budget and our cat planning exercise within the operating plan is modeled out based on expected losses. Clearly, there's been substantial volatility over several of the years, not all of them. Last year was a bit more modest, actually below plan. The 7% is how it works out mechanically between reinsurance and insurance. Having said that, we have taken our cat portfolio and reduced its risk profile over the years since - essentially since Harvey, Irma Maria back in 2017. And so that de-risking that we've taken has been quite conscious. And alternatively, the group and I think you saw this highlighted during the Investor Day, is really expanding in other non-cat lines of business. So I would expect Everest going forward, whether it's reinsurance or insurance to continue to de-emphasize cat as a significant driver of premium and profit but it's still a meaningful and attractive risk, despite the volatility. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then sort of reinsurance, it sounded like, you didn't have to change your loss picks because of the cash that didn't meet the $10 million threshold. Should we think about that as a more likely outcome in the fourth quarter, just given the pace of the activity we've seen here today, is there risk of that could be some loss picks change in 4Q in recent and other activity? Mark Kociancic : I just want to make sure I understand your question. Are you wondering if our Q3 events that were smaller in size are going to bleed into Q4 or are you questioning what's happening in Q4? Ryan Tunis : No, I mean, my understanding was that that you guys have like a loss pick budget for those attritional type losses and I was wondering if - maybe you haven't exceeded that yet but maybe you were close to that or might not? Mark Kociancic : Yeah, yeah. Okay. So look in Q3, there were several other cat events globally. They were relatively small for us. I highlighted in my opening remarks that our cap threshold is $10 million and so there were a few that fell underneath that and those were easily absorbed into our Q3 attritional loss ratios, so I don't expect any development from there going into Q4. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just wondering, I was curious about is it, from a reinsurance perspective and property cat treaty, when you have a storm like Ida, I'm just looking for some perspective here, how many treaty claims do you have? Is it that most of that loss is in five claims or are we talking about 70 or 80 treaties? Directionally trying to understand when you get losses like this, how concentrated is that in individual seats? Jim Williamson : Yeah, Ryan, this is this is Jim Williamson. I mean, look, what I would say, if you're talking about an event like Ida, you're definitely going to see losses across a large number of cedants, I think that's to be expected. And then, a bit of an obvious statement, but really big cedants who have larger exposures will drive a meaningful portion of the total loss. But this was a pretty broad event, and particularly as it related to a major impact followed by a smaller flooding event. It's going to, I think, carry a fair number of cedants into loss activity. Juan Andrade : The one thing that I would add to that Ryan is, think about the geographic - this is one I am driving, by the way, think about the geographic scope of the storm, making impact in Louisiana, extending through the mid-Atlantic and going up into the northeast, all the way along the way. So you're going to have different actors, right. So you're going to have some regional cedants, particularly in the Gulf states and then you have some of the national carriers who are impacted both in the southeast as well as the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast as well. So I would say it's a mixture of that basically. Ryan Tunis : Thanks, Juan. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Two small questions and one bigger picture. A small question is, did the attritional loss ratios in either reinsurance or insurance include any adjustments to the first half of the year? Jim Williamson : Yeah, Meyer. This is Jim Williamson. No, there were really no material adjustments related to activity that happened earlier in the year, it was really reflective of the third quarter activity. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. And I know we're all sort of focused on cat, so I want us to question in a slightly different way. With S&P sort of rumbling that they're going to possibly increase capital requirements for cat because the industry might be under estimating it and given the apparently high possibility of call it above average losses for the year, how important is it to have a risk strategy to write any property cat at all? Juan Andrade : Yeah, so let me address that Meyer, I think that's a fundamental question. Look, we are in the property cap business but we're also mindful that the external market conditions have changed over time, and they have changed for a number of reasons, right. You clearly have the impact of climate change, as we've discussed, it has manifested. We certainly see the impact of the ILS market that basically I think has muted the size of the rate increases that you see post events like Ida into that market. And so while we see it as an attractive line of business, we also see better returns in other lines of business going forward. And it's part and parcel of the reason why we have been on this de-risking journey that we have continued to talk about, to essentially change the profile of our company. So, all of that is in our minds. We are students of the environment. We are students of the science. We're also very disciplined in how we look at our portfolio and how we allocate capital between lines of business. And this brings us full circle back to the question that Elyse and Mike Zaremski asked earlier in the call, right. It's one of the reasons why you see us basically growing in the in the casualty lines of business at this point in time. So it's definitely part of the equation, it's definitely part of the strategy as we conceive our plan and we drive the company forward. Meyer Shields : Okay. Understood. Thank you very much. Mark Kociancic : Sure, my thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Thanks. A couple quick ones here. First one, I'm just curious, can you talk a little bit about how the current inflationary pressures that we're seeing economically impacted your business and influence your loss picks? And then on top of that, maybe add a little bit in your view toward inflationary rate right now, are you seeing any increase as courts reopened at all? Juan Andrade : Yeah, sure. Let me address that Brian and I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it. Look, I think it's important to recognize what inflation means to the industry versus what we see in the CPI index and the headline news that's out there. I think it's undeniable that we are in a period of inflationary pressure from a purely CPI perspective. You see it in our goods, you see the upsurge in demand, the restriction in supply that's going on up there and you definitely see a part of that. And it's manifested in used car values, and chips, and all of these things that are out there basically. From our perspective, we monitor from the asset and the liability side. On the liability side of our balance sheet, we're specifically focused on wage inflation and also on healthcare inflation, the cost of medical care, basically. Those are critical things that that we watch very carefully. Now, your question on how that translates into how we think about loss fix, etc., is excellent, because that is part of the analysis that we do on a quarterly basis, when we're looking at our loss fix and, frankly, when we're doing our bridging for future year plans and when we're doing our reserve studies, etc. And we try to build in those inflationary pressures into our numbers. And it's one of the reasons why we keep pushing for pricing and why we believe that this pricing environment will continue for at least another year, if not longer, for the longer tail classes of businesses. The other thing that's important to recognize is that also on the liability side, there are some mitigants in the book, right. So if you think about exposure rated lines, like general liability, workers compensation, etc., those will rise also with the impact of inflation and so there's some hedges that are built into that. But the primary hedge for us is how we look at our loss picks and how we do the analysis on a quarterly basis. When we look at the asset side of the balance sheet, that's also how we position our portfolio to make sure that we are as fireproof as possible and while we maintain the liquidity there. But let me ask Mark to add some commentary on the asset side, and then I'll invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more on the liability side. Mark Kociancic : Yeah, so Brian, it's Mark. Look, on the asset side, this is something we think about because it's unclear how permanent or transitory the inflationary pressure that we're seeing is going to be going forward. And so we've got our portfolio, the asset portfolio positioned such that we think it can react reasonably well, versus a high inflation environment. And so there's a high degree of liquidity as well, that augments the kind of cash demands that you would have in a high inflation scenario. We benefit from shorter term asset duration and a relatively short duration on the liability portfolio plus a significant amount of assets exposed to equities or floating rate debt, which should be somewhat immunized in a high inflation environment. The other piece that I'll add, maybe before Jim steps in, is we have stressed the liability portfolio for different inflation scenarios and to see how it would perform and our ability to absorb it. And so that's something we do, in addition to the reserving side of the assumptions, etc., is to see how it can perform in different types of environments. Jim Williamson : Yeah, Brian, this is Jim Williamson and I'll just address the second part of your question related to any bounce back that we may be seeing in our data related to the reopening of courts and frankly, the reopening and growth in the economy. And I think there is a degree of bounce back occurring, we certainly see it in areas like liability frequencies, we see it in medical utilization. It's not a tremendous effect. But it's also, I think, feeds into the rationale for being very consistent in how we set loss picks and not over responding to some of the good news that has come through in our data and you wait for that to mature, so that some of these transitory items like a bounce back in activity have time to play themselves out, and that's very consistent with our approach around loss election. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. Thanks. And then my second question, when you've talked about growing your insurance business internationally, I'm just curious, do you have the platform right now to actually really see some good growth there or are there some areas that you need to expand? either organically or in organically? Jim Williamson : Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. So, we are very focused right now on the next step of our journey, on the primary side of our business. I think we've done a very nice job growing it in the US specifically over time, and we see significant overseas opportunity, right. The reality is that the market is quite big and it's also a diversifying opportunity. One of the things that you learn over time is that emerging markets and developed markets move to different rhythms. And so when developed economies are down, emerging economies are up, and it's a good diversifying hedge from that perspective, in addition to the insurance market opportunity that's out there. Right now, we have a company out of Ireland, that allows us to do business in the continent of Europe, we have our Lloyd's syndicate and so we're able to utilize that as a platform for expansion in Europe and in the UK. When you start thinking about expansion into Latin America and Asia, you are thinking more of a greenfield type opportunity at that point in time and our plans are very much in motion right now to be able - to grow that business organically but it also goes back to the question that I was asked earlier in the call as to how does M&A potentially fit into all of this and our strategy is organic, as I said, but we're also mindful of any opportunities that may help to accelerate our progress as we move forward. Brian Meredith : Makes sense? Thank you. Jim Williamson : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America Securities. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Thank you very much for taking my question late in the call. Growth obviously is very large in the insurance segments, particularly professional lines and specialty. But every line of business grew including workers comp, which you cited has being slightly below trend, I guess, in terms of performance. And given what we're seeing pricing, certainly it isn't up yet in workers' comp. Can you talk a little about the growth in workers' comp, which wasn't tremendous, but it was still growth in a pricing environment that may not be particularly favorable? Mike Karmilowicz : Sure, Josh, thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz. Yeah, the growth in comp, there's a big part of that in the exposure change that's coming from just the payrolls and obviously people going back to work. And then the other piece, keep in mind is, a big part of our business that's been growing has been the loss readable and - loss sense and loss readable business on the risk management side. We continue to do the same thing we talked about as being very disciplined around our motto line, guaranteed cost comp. So again, most of that growth is just coming from specifically the overall exposure change. Juan Andrade : Yeah, and I think Josh, what I would add to that, again, keep in mind what we've said in the past, not only have we de-prioritized the growth of worker's compensation for what we've said and what you've pointed out in your question, but within workers compensation, our focus has really been more on the loss ratable risk management type business where we can actually get better pricing than the mono line. And that's one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks, I emphasized the fact that while comp overall is now down to only 12% of the portfolio, mono line is down to only 7% of the portfolio, right. So it's important to understand that nuance with income at the same time. Josh Shanker : Thank you. And this is maybe a bit cheeky. But you raised the debt and you had Ida and you bought back stock. I know, you said that your preference is to grow organically. But can you talk about when you bought the stock in the quarter? I mean, maybe I'm trying to get a little sense of appetite more so. Was it after Ida, was it before Ida, was it after the capital raise? I guess I'm looking for a little color there. Mark Kociancic : Yeah, both, before and after, so at the beginning of the quarter and also in September. If I could just add Josh - sorry, it's Mark speaking. If I could just add a couple of points. We made it pretty clear during the investor day that we felt we could get a more efficient capital structure and part of that is increasing the debt leverage of the company into a 15% to 20% range. And when you look at the kind of print that we got the three and an eighth coupon that's very low, long-term capital costs, so for us, the combination of issuing the debt and using it to fund future growth expansion is really a function of providing a lower cost of capital for that organic growth in line with, I think, what is a more conventional capital structure with something closer to 20% debt leverage. I think the share buybacks that's really, look, a function of our confidence in our business. I wouldn't read too much else into it, the volatility that we had from the cats is something that we expect in this business, it was very much in a risk appetite. It never dissuaded us from any kind of capital management actions and so, we move forward here with a lot of confidence. And that was one of the points I was trying to make towards the end of my monologue regarding the affirmation of our plan, assumptions, the target and the path that we're on. We feel like there's an excellent opportunity in front of us, we're built for it, we're executing, and there's a lot of momentum. Josh Shanker : Well, I appreciate all the clarity. Thank you very much. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion today. I'll wrap up today's call by reiterating our confidence in our ability to continue fueling profitable growth, seizing the opportunities before us and advancing our strategy. The goals that we've outlined are ambitious, but we've already made material inroads on our path forward. We're making investments in our talent, our culture, in our capabilities, because we believe those are the ones that will help us drive superior shareholder returns. I'm bullish about the future of Everest. Thank you for your time with us today and for your continued support of our company. I look forward to seeing you all again to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end results. Thank you Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call off to Jon Levenson with Everest. Jon Levenson : Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2021 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Thank you Jon. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. 2021 was a pivotal year of profitable growth and continued momentum for Everest. We finished the year with a strong quarter and achieved record growth in both our franchises, drove expanding margins and solid underwriting profitability and generated exceptional investment income. This led to a $1.4 billion in net income for the year and a milestone 14.7% total shareholder return against the 13% target. These results reflect the strong earnings power of our diversified businesses to create value for our shareholders, even in years of elevated natural catastrophes. With a more profitable book of business coming out of a well-executed January 1 reinsurance renewal season, and expanding global value proposition, a strong balance sheet and exceptional talent, we entered 2022 well positioned to deliver on our strategic objectives. Before I provide details about our results, I want to acknowledge the contributions of my global colleagues this year. 2021 was challenging for our industry. Despite the continued global pandemic and significant climate driven catastrophes, we advanced our strategic priorities with disciplined execution and delivered first class products and solutions to our customers. In 2021, we accelerated many of our strategic priorities, building on a discipline foundation that drives greater profitability and less volatility in our business. We make key investments in the people, technology, and infrastructure that are optimizing all three of our core earnings drivers, reinsurance, insurance, and investments for superior performance. First, our underwriting franchises. We continue to build on our market leading position in global P&C reinsurance. As a preferred provider with diverse product offerings and relevant client driven solutions, our insurance franchise is scaling and diversifying, increasing margins, and driving relevance in more markets through a focus underwriting and distribution strategy and an expanding footprint. And the market is responding with increased demand for our products, evidenced by strong growth in both franchises, and consecutive quarterly top line records in insurance this year. Focused execution in 2021 led to a solid underwriting outcome that is particularly meaningful in the context of a $130 billion catastrophe year. Our continued diversification, volatility reduction, and disciplined underwriting are yielding profitable returns. A recent example is our success executing a clearly defined and measured strategy into January 1 renewal average this year to a focus plan. This resulted in our current portfolio being stronger, more diversified, and more profitable. Our commitment to operational excellence and an entrepreneurial model that keeps us agile and responsive to our clients ready to pivot with rapidly changing market conditions is a big part of how we accomplish this. To this end, we made material inroads in 2021 on our path to becoming a digitally enabled organization through superior data, analytics and technology that are bringing more depth and dimension to how we manage segment and model risk with greater speed and precision. With regard to investments, performance was excellent in 2021 driven by a prudent approach to optimizing a well-balanced, high credit quality investment portfolio that supports our franchises and helps to drive meaningful returns. Reflecting on Everest accomplishments in the past year, I am proud of the diverse, inclusive and purpose driven culture that supports everything we do. Our continued emphasis of ESG as a core pillar of our long term strategy was most recently reflected by our decision to become a signatory to the UN principles for sustainable insurance. Finally, talent drives our performance. Everest is proud to be an employer of choice in our industry and throughout the year we attracted and events exceptional talents across the global organization who will help us to drive this next chapter of profitable growth and bring our offering to more customers around the globe. Let\u2019s turn to our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2021. Beginning with our group results. In the quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 25%. Growth was broad and diversified across both segments. In the fourth quarter, we generated $228 million in underwriting profit with a combined ratio of 91.1 and an attritional combined ratio of 87.4 reflecting continued margin expansion in our insurance division. Turning to the full year 2021, average grew gross written premiums 25% setting a new record for our company of over $13 billion. Net written premiums grew 26% year-over-year The group combined ratio was 97.8% including 1.1 billion in catastrophe losses which is less than 1% of the industry\u2019s estimated $130 billion loss in 2021, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and reduced volatility. The group attritional combined ratio was 87.6 for the year. These results demonstrate the progress against our strategic priorities to continue to optimize the portfolio to drive margin. Prudently manage expenses and enhance operational efficiencies. Let\u2019s turn to our reinsurance results. Our reinsurance division had a strong fourth quarter and finished the year solidly with gross written premium exceeding 9 billion a 25% increase over 2020. Gross written premium growth in the fourth quarter was excellent up 26%. This growth was broad based and supported by underlying rate increases and the economic growth, increased opportunities with our core trading partners, targeted growth on profitable property and casualty programs. The division generated a 176 million of underwriting profit in the fourth quarter with a combined ratio of 91.5. The attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 86.4 reflecting the continued performance of our portfolio, the successful execution of our strategy to participate in growth and margin improvement in the casualty market and on-going expense discipline. We ended 2021 with a 98.1 combined ratio and an attritional combined ratio of 86.3. These results reflect our progress in reshaping our risk profile to achieve superior returns. We continue to actively diversify our reinsurance portfolio with an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. We are disciplined and focused about getting appropriately for risk. We made meaningful progress advancing these priorities to the January 1, 2022 renewal period that started with a cleared and focussed strategy with three key objectives. One, continue reducing volatility in our overall book by decreasing cat exposure and growing less volatile non-catastrophe loss. Two, optimize our property portfolio to maximized returns. And three focussed capacity with top underwriters. The breadth of average preferred market position built over decades and strong trading relationships combined with our size and capital gave us a distinct advantage. Our team was precise above where we deployed capital and focused on improving the economics in our property book. We maintain discipline where pricing did not meet our returned vessels. Rate increases were favorable across most property and casualty lines, with financial lines and loss effective property lines seeing the highest uptake. For example, loss effective programs in Europe particularly in Germany. Many catastrophe programs were restructured to ensure participation on higher layers. Despite how late the property renewals came together, there was ample capacity available for most seasons outside of retro and loss impacted aggregate covers. While the casualty market was competitive with upward pressure on ceding commissions, continued underlying rate improvements helped drive better overall economics, notably in casualty quota share. We successfully achieved targeted growth in our Retail Continental European portfolio across P&C lines, as well as our U.K. excessive loss portfolio. Within property, we reduced our exposure to property retro, lower margin property, pro rata business and working catastrophe layers, while at the same time growing targeted clients at excellent terms. Overall, we meaningfully reduce catastrophe loss potential in our book and achieve gross premium [ph] reductions in key peak zones. We have a more profitable and higher margin book. I'm proud of the team's discipline during a dynamic renewable season. Now a few comments about Mt. Logan. Mt. Logan plays an important role in our long term growth aspirations, and is uniquely positioned given its excellent alignment with the average property portfolio. We have a strong pipeline of prospective investors. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Logan and we continue investing in the platform with new products customized to meet investor\u2019s objectives. During the year, we also strengthened our leadership bench and key promotions and hires, in North America, Latin America and elsewhere internationally. And in Mt. Logan. These talents, positions and promotions were part of a successful effort to optimize and streamline our structure, which is already benefiting the organization. In summary, our reinsurance business is better positioned today to support strong underwriting income results, capitalize on market opportunities, and further expand our market leadership. Now let's turn to the insurance division. Insurance had an excellent fourth quarter, delivering both top line growth and bottom line profitability, supported by continued strong underlying performance and progress in the long term targets outlined in our strategic plan. Insurance growth in the fourth quarter was 21%. We achieved over 1 billion in gross written premium for the third consecutive quarter. This resulted in a record 4 billion in gross written premiums for the year, or up 24% over 2020. The growth in the fourth quarter was influenced by a few factors. First, we continue to benefit from increasing exposures as the economy rebounds. Second, strong renewal retention, favorable market conditions and double digit rate increases across all of our target classes, excluding workers compensation, where rates are slightly down. Third, sales execution, we deepened and diversified our distribution network. And we sharpened our execution with a quantitative and metrics based approach to sales. As a result, we improve our hit ratios by 24% and 32% year-over-year in our retail and wholesale channels respectively. Four, strong new business growth in both retail and wholesale channels, primarily in casualty, professional, and transactional liability, along with accidents and health, partially offsetting the growth was targeted portfolio repositioning in our U.S. property and catastrophe exposed business where we continue to reduce overall volatility and improve margins. This includes on-going portfolio management related to modeling [ph] workers compensation, which is now only about 7% of global gross written premiums. We delivered another strong underwriting result with a quarterly combined ratio of 92.8 and an underwriting profit of 52 million. Our underlying performance was also outstanding. The 90.4 attritional combined ratio is a 3.4 point improvement, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and an almost eight point improvement since 2019. Our loss ratio, commission ratio and operating expense ratios all improved, including a 3.8 point loss ratio improvement for the fourth quarter. We are committed to sustaining this positive momentum and we are sharpening our focus in two key areas to achieve it. First, is proactive cycle management. We are building a diversified business. As I mentioned, we continue to see growth in a number of our specialty lines, and we will grow more profitable crop classes of business over time. Our diversified product offering and relevance in both the E&S and Retail channels allow us to seize new opportunities in the evolving market. Second is increased efficiency and scale. For instance we are increasing efficiency by enhancing our claims process to improve productivity, speed and accuracy, resulting in better claims outcomes and higher customer satisfaction. An important part of this our continued investment in advanced tools, such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, which creates greater operational efficiencies, and delivers better insights, enabling fact based decisions and best-in-class customer experiences. As to scale, we also expanded our footprint in Latin America, Asia, and Europe, where we see opportunity to profitably grow across the 800 billion plus global commercial P&C industry. We have a thoughtful expansion plan outside of North America that brings together existing capabilities, expertise and knowledge to a broader and more global customer base in places where we can grow profitably. Building our company for the future is a marathon, it\u2019s not a sprint. I'm very encouraged by the ambition, the tenacity, and the hard work this team consistently demonstrates. I'm proud of our results, but we remain hyper focused on daily execution as we position our company for the future. An agile global company focused on providing exceptional service and risk solutions to our clients, a company that is respected for its influence and impact in the marketplace. That follows a strong risk management framework that delivers consistent and leading returns with a world class global team united by the passion to win. Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more details. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan during the quarter and the full year 2021 as we remain well on track to achieve our investor day strategic plan objectives, notably the full year 13% or greater total shareholder return, or TSR. I'll spend some time providing additional context on the underlying assumptions. But first, let's review the fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of 3.4 billion, representing 25% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 26% to 2.4 billion and insurance once again reported gross written premium of 1 billion in the quarter, representing 21% year-over-year growth. For the full year 2021, Everest achieved 13 billion in total gross written premium, 9 billion for reinsurance and 4 billion for insurance. Turning to net income, for the fourth quarter of 2021 Everest delivered strong net income of 431 million equal to $10.94 per diluted share, and an annualized return on equity of 17.7%. On an operating income basis, the numbers are 359 million for the quarter, and $9.12 per diluted share, with an annualized operating return on equity of 14.8%. For the full year 2021 net income was 1.38 billion equal to $34.62 per diluted share, and a full year return on equity of 14.6%. Operating income for the year was 1.15 billion, or $28.97 per diluted share equal to an operating ROE of 12.2%. Book value per share ended the year at $258.21, an increase of 8.7% for the year adjusted for dividends. The TSR for the year stands at 14.7%, which as one noted exceeds our 2023 full year target and reflects the robust and well diversified earnings power of Everest. Let me focus on several key financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We incurred $125 million of pretax cat losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter, with the primary event being the Canadian crop loss and the amount of $80 million. We've profitably underwritten the Canadian crop market for a number of years and view this as an attractive long term business. The crop loss event is one of the largest property casualty losses in Canadian history at nearly $6 billion with the underlying drought conditions unseen for 60 years. The other significant pretax cap loss, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter was from the quad state tornados, which took place in December, $45 million in total, $30 million in our reinsurance segment and $15 million in insurance. We also know that there was not any unfavorable prior period, or prior year development in the cat losses this quarter. For 2022 Everest expects a cat load of less than 6% in line with our 6% to 7% investor day guidance, and driven by a combination of reduced volatility from our cap portfolio, and expanding into other lines with higher risk adjusted margin. Consistent with prior quarters, we remain confident in Everest's overall reserve position. Starting with one's [ph] arrival at Everest, we've continued to strengthen and improve our reserve processes in a number of ways; in the establishment of prudent initial loss picks, a balanced and timely scheduled during the year to review our reserves, and taking decisive action when needed. All of this is driven by improved processes and analysis tools to allow our actuaries to focus on interpreting the numbers and making the most informed decisions. Our COVID-19 incurred loss provision remains consistent at 511 million total incurred. This number is unchanged since here in 2020. The majority of this reserve remains is IBNR. And we remain confident in our overall COVID reserve position. We reconfirm our strategic plan assumption for combined ratio, with the range of 91% to 93% for the group for the full year 2022. Our overall 2021 combined ratio stood at 97.8% driven by cat losses, ending the year at 10.9 points. The disciplined cap book underwriting achieved at January 1 is meaningful and will reduce volatility on an expected basis, thus further insulating Everest from outsized cat losses. Our attritional combined ratio stood at 87.6% broadly stable versus 2020. Everest continues to have a very competitive expense ratio; 5.7% for the quarter, and 5.6% for the year, below our working assumption of approximately 6% for the group, as shared in our strategic plan. Specific to this quarter, other underwriting expenses and reinsurance reflect some non-recurring charges and I expect the reinsurance expense ratio to remain under 3% for 2022. Investment income for the quarter was 205 million, ending an exceptional year with 1.16 billion in pretax net investment income. The Everest investment portfolio continues to be refined within the tolerances detailed in our June investor day, with a focus on asset liability duration matching, strong credit quality and liquidity and improving capital efficiency, all while enhancing yield for our core portfolio, which are assets backing reserves. For our total return portfolio, which is private equity focus, we see good opportunities for continued investment. And within our core portfolio, we have nearly 20% of our fixed income investments and floating rate investments, which affords Everest good insulation from a rising interest rate environment. We also continue to run duration at 3.2 years, somewhat shorter than our liability duration of approximately four years. Specific to our limited partnership investments, the excellent contribution during 2021 is from a well-diversified portfolio. And we see continued room to add to this asset class under our strategic plan targets. Finally, to conclude on investments we reaffirm our 2022 expected return on invested assets in the range of 2.75% to 3.25%. For the full year 2021, Everest generated an exceptional 3.8 billion in operating cash flow driven by strong premium growth. This cash flow in our $1 billion debt offering fueled our investment portfolio, which ended the year at 29.7 billion of assets under management. The Everest balance sheet ended 2021 in an excellent position, shareholders\u2019 equity was 10.1 billion at year-end 2021 and we continue to optimize our capital structure with the $1 billion Senior Notes offering completed in early October. At a three and an eighth coupon, this 31-year offering further lowers our overall cost of capital, while expanding our underwriting firepower. Our financial leverage at year-end was 20.2% and we see that ratio within our 15% to 20% strategic plan assumption range by the end of 2023. As part of our capital management strategy, we also repurchase $25 million in Everest common shares during the quarter, bringing the full year total to 225 million. For the full year, our net income tax rate was 10.8% and we see 11% to 12% as a good estimate for net income tax rate in 2022. 2021 validated the progress Everest has made towards our 2023 strategic plan objectives. Our underwriting businesses are vibrant and profitable. Our investment portfolio was well optimized for the current market environment, and our balance sheet and franchise provide us with the optionality to grow into classes and territories where we see the highest returns. Everest is well positioned to seize market opportunities and navigate the current macroeconomic environment. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon. Jon Levenson : Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow up and then re-join the queue if you have any remaining questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very much. Good quarter and great outlook and I\u2019m thinking 25 million in shares repurchases in 4Q and I'm trying to figure out what the ROI on incremental capital use is for insurance, versus reinsurance versus ploughing [ph] into your stock at this price. Mark Kociancic : Josh its Mark. Good morning and thanks for the compliments on the results. So we're --let me split this into a few buckets. So when we allocate capital, we're certainly privileging organic growth, and different opportunities competing against each other, whether it's the capital management aspect, or expanding the franchises in reinsurance, or insurance. And so our TSR objective of at least 13% is really the cornerstone on a risk adjusted basis when we look at these different opportunities. And so we have ample capital to deploy in both businesses and also for capital management actions, like share buybacks, were unconstrained in that aspect. And so I think in 2022, you'll see this philosophy continued. Joshua Shanker : Are all options almost equal at these prices? Or like, is there a difference in where you'd prefer to put capital if you can only make one choice? Mark Kociancic : Well, we definitely privilege the organic growth, because I think that expands the franchise, and we're going to create more long term value for shareholders. So I would definitely put that one. Within that you've got three buckets, insurance, reinsurance and investments which are equally competing for capital and for opportunities. I think the share buybacks are certainly on the table at the same time, and we're looking at it opportunistically during the year. Joshua Shanker : And in that regard, and reinsurance renewals and trending, what's happening with ceding commissions? How is it impacting the returns in that business? And do you have an outlook for where that's going to impact numbers in the future? Jim Williamson : Sure. Hey, Josh, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, just to give you a little bit of perspective, particularly around what we saw at one, one. We've been pursuing in a very deliberate fashion a strategy of growing with our core scenes particularly in casualty lines, and particularly on a pro rata basis. And we've had a great deal of success through one, one with that strategy and feel really good about the results that we're seeing. Look there's no question that there is a significant change taking place in the underlying insurance markets. Margins are expanding very quickly, we see rate well ahead of loss trend. Limits are being reduced. Coverage grants are being narrowed. And so all of those things add up to creating margin for our scenes, and then for us as we participate in those programs. And as you can imagine, there's going to be some trade around that with respect to ceding commissions. And so we have seen over the last couple of years, and we certainly saw a little bit at one one, some upward pressure on ceding commissions in the casualty market, we think they were they remain reasonable. For the most part, there were definitely programs that were beyond reasonable, and we don't participate in those programs, but mostly reasonable. And I think the bottom line is the margin that's being created, plus a little extra seeds still results in improving economics for us. On the property side, it was much more flat. As you can imagine, as people are seeking capacity and seeking to fill out their programs, we do see some improving economics in our book there. And the ceding commissions are not moving the same way they are in casualty. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very much for the precise answers. Jim Williamson : Thanks, Josh. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. Kind of related question on reinsurance from the last month on ceding commissions. I guess on that, and Jim you just mentioned a bit of the profitability on the cedings. I guess I want to take that too, as the cedings kind of hold on to more risk and increase their own retentions, what does that mean for your outlook for how much of that was influencing growth this quarter? And what does that mean for your outlook for reinsurance growth and the year ahead? Jim Williamson : Yes, sure, Mike, this is Jim again. To provide a little bit of perspective in terms of the fourth quarter growth rate for casualty, both on a pro rata and XOL basis, we achieved record levels of written premium, at what we view is very attractive margins. Those lines were essentially our fastest growing lines in the quarter. So I think that's an important fact. And look, at the end of the day, there are definitely cedings who think about how much of their own business they want to see to their reinsurers, particularly in the pro rata lines. And we did see around the margin, some movement away from pro rata structures, people shifting into XOL. However, one area that we focus very closely on is ceding selection. And what we're looking for when we choose to partner with a ceding with one of our core ceding in particular, are folks that consistently manage their reinsurance placements. And so we're trying to avoid cedings who are shifting quarter-to-quarter in terms of their participation. And we saw a lot of consistency among our cedings. I think the other piece that we've benefit from, given the strength of our franchise and our local trading relationships is in even in areas where maybe the total value of the session came down, there were areas where we were able to increase, share and sustain our revenue stream from our core clients. So all-in-all, I think a very successful fourth quarter and a very successful one, one from that perspective. Michael Phillips : Okay, Jim thank you. It may be a little higher level question, maybe an industry question, I guess, as well. We've seen recently a lot of activity in the Florida market where some pretty big players are pulling out of the market. And one, I'm curious what you think that might mean for the industry, what we think that we think it means for maybe the next year or two for the industry, and maybe even specifically, any implications for your business in MLB [ph]. Thanks. Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike. So this is Juan Andrade, and I'll start. Look, I think certainly what, what you saw take place in the industry in one one, and really, in the latter part of the fourth quarter was, frankly a lot of companies catching up on what we've been doing really over the last couple of years, which is looking at volatility and their book of business and making trade-offs and decisions on that. And again, this is something that we're ahead of the curve, as you've seen in our numbers, as you've seen in our calls and the dialogue that we've had. Look, the reality is that pricing in property cat has improved some, but it hasn't improved meaningfully enough to be able to justify and pay for the catastrophe exposure that we'll see that is really being driven by climate change. And so that has proven underwriters to be I think, a lot more prudent particularly in an environment like Florida and southeast wind in general. So I think the issue there becomes more of a public policy issue going forward, about capacity, the ability to ensure there's public policy questions with regard to zoning, with regard to construction, to essentially how we deal with a problem that we all have as a society that is related to the warming of the seas, rising sea levels, etcetera. But I would invite, I would invite Jim also to add maybe some commentary on that. Jim Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim. I'll just add a little bit more detail. I think one of the things that we clearly saw during the one one renewal was some meaningful dislocation in the retro market. And our expectation is that will play through into the Florida renewals in a very meaningful way. And so I do think there's going to be challenges as those renewals come up over the summer. And I think we're reasonably bullish that that could result in some significant rate increases, changes to programs, etcetera. That could present opportunity for us in a very selective way. Overtime, we've right sized our Florida or southeast wind portfolio. We are taking a level of risk that we're very comfortable with. And coming out of one, one, we do have dry powder that we can deploy selectively when we see great opportunities. And so if the sorts of trends that we're discussing here and the implication of your question come to pass, and there's a lot of dislocation in the Florida market, we might use it as an opportunity to selectively and in a very targeted fashion, pursue some incremental opportunity at great returns. Michael Phillips : Thank you guys for the detail, appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter. Jim Williamson : Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question you guys provided a 6% cat load guidance for 2022, which is at the low end of the target you laid out at Investor day. So I'm assuming that this implies that there's some mix shift going on, as you've discussed, to towards casualty in a way from some property cat related businesses really, probably within your reinsurance business. So how do we think about this mix shift impacting the underlying margin, and particularly the underlying loss ratio in reinsurance? Because I know you reaffirmed your overall guidance for 2022. But if the cat load is lower, does that mean, the underlying margin itself or the underlying combined ratio is a little bit higher due just to the mix shift going on? Juan Andrade : Yes, Elyse, this is Juan in. Thank you for the question. So let me break it up in a couple of points. And then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to jump in as well. With regard to the guidance that Mark gave on the cat loss ratio, he said less than 6%. And that's basically related to a lot of the de-risking actions that I spoke to, in my prepared remarks earlier in this call. The reality is we have meaningfully reduced catastrophe loss potential in our book. We've achieved PML reductions in key peaks zones, and we've improved their overall portfolio economics. Catastrophe limits to COVID has been reduced, with a favorable reduction in expected average annual loss. So that is the key driver of the cat loss ratio coming down from our perspective. The other part of that is the fact that we are diversifying the book into non-cat lines of business. But as far as we're concerned, the margin that we expect to generate from the reinsurance division, if anything will improve in 2022, because of the actions that we have taken, but I'll invite Mark to up to add some additional color. Mark Kociancic : Yeah, good morning, Elyse. Not too much more to add to Juan's comments, because I think he was quite complete. But we're definitely seeing somewhat of a mix shift between the growth of cat and the growth of other non-cat lines. We\u2019re firmly in the 91 to 93. I think we have pretty good confidence on that going forward. So I don't expect that to impact the underlying profitability on the reinsurance side very much. And on a risk adjusted basis, I think this makes the most sense, given where we are with market opportunities. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my follow up question on S&P is in the process of collecting comments on it's a revised capital model that it's looking to put out there. We're just hoping to get some comments on how this could impact Everest. I know since you guys are have the U.S. based, I think that that would impact you less than some of the Bermuda peers. But if you could just give us a sense of how you're thinking through the impact of the capital model on Everest? Thank you. Mark Kociancic : Yes, it\u2019s Mark again, Elyse. So we're watching this as it as it develops. There's only been kind of high level proposals that have been shared with the industry and we've obviously been very engaged in terms of direct discussion and industry, the discussions on it. I really don't see that much of an impact based on what we know today. S&P is definitely extending their timetable for industry feedback and will provide, I think, more detailed proposals thereafter. I think the biggest thing, and you've highlighted it in your question is really the debt issuance capabilities of Bermuda regulated companies. And it's an important factor to distinguish that Everest has a U.S. Holdco. That issues -- has issued our debt in the past, and we expect it to continue to be the main issuing legal entity for Everest going forward. That is within a regulatory domicile of the U.S. as opposed to Bermuda, so it should be unaffected. And therefore, we would avoid some of the concerns that have been elevated with that aspect. The other parts, that they've come out with last development factor charges that are somewhat higher with corresponding diversification benefits. We'll see how that impacts the industry, as long as they're based on sound economics, I think we'll be fine. The cat loss adjustments that they're making, into a broader timescale, 200 one in 200 to one in 500 years I think makes a lot of sense. And we're very careful on tail risk nonetheless. So I think we'll be fine there. The last piece is really more on the investment side. We've got some comments to make there. But we've got a broadly diversified portfolio that's high credit quality, so not too concerned, but S&P is very well respected, and they have a big impact on the industry. So you're going to see, I'm sure many companies comment on these proposals as time goes on. But for us, I think it's, we don't expect it to be very impactful. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Mark Kociancic : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. A couple of points for you here. First, Mark, I'm just curious, as an outsider, what's the best way for us to evaluate your excess capital position? I mean, look at your operating leverage is moving up. And that makes sense given the reductions in your P&L and kind of move it more towards insurance. How should we think about it that maybe should we continue to think about that operating leverage moving on? Mark Kociancic : Well, we're in an access capital position; you know that we have the two debt raises. And I think we gave you pretty good guidance on the investor day in terms of our growth ambitions. And so for able to execute the strategic plan, I think we're going to be in good shape in terms of funding it. But we do have flexibility to grow more rapidly, as you saw last year, particularly in reinsurance where you saw approximately a 25% growth rate print, and we gave per annum guidance of 8 to 12. So there are times where we can really see what the market gives us. And then similarly on insurance, I think we're getting very strong growth there. Last year well over 20% and I think we've got a very good trajectory this year. I think that level of growth is probably the primary factor on how the excess capital develops in conjunction with the overall profitability of the group. So now we're in a, I think, a very good situation with excess capital, so no constraints on growing the group. And then we look at how the profitability evolves as we take into account future capital management actions, whether we're talking about buybacks or funding, more organic growth. I did mention last year, I\u2019d say it might have even been Q4 in 2020. But I did see a lot of potential to improve the efficiency of the capital allocation in the group and you're getting to this point on operating leverage, there's probably some more that we can achieve and still be very capital efficient. And that's really kind of an all three buckets investments and the two divisions as well. So there is a bit more efficiency on that aspect that I would expect us to achieve in 2022. Thereafter, you're really talking about optimizing, but I like our position as it stands right now. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. Thanks for the answer. And the second question just on the 13% TSR that you guys have laid out what does that contemplate with respect to the interest rate environment. We obviously have interest rates have moved up subsequent to when you laid that out and that's an important part obviously of your TSR here. Its\u2019 -- unrealized gains and losses on your on your book value. So how do we think about that? Mark Kociancic : When we set up the plan last year, we took the base forecast for forward curves on interest rates. And that served as the underlying assumption primarily in the investment portfolio. And so I reaffirmed, for example, the investment returns. It's a factor that we have to manage in the execution of a plan. So whether it's underwriting or investments, and we're fine, with whatever direction that goes. Obviously if rates are rising, it's I think we got some more tailwind behind us. But it's one of the reasons when we went through the definition of the TSR that we excluded, the volatility that comes from unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio. And so that is where we expect not to be, we're creating real economic value, despite some of the macroeconomic volatility that can come from rates. And so that's why we set the TSR up the way, the way it is. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks, good morning. A question for Juan. So you gave us the targets at investor day and since then, interest rates have gone in our favor. You've lowered your cat load you're exceeding the TSR goals, even in a tough 2021 cat year. Are we on a normalized basis looks an excessive 13%. So could you just give us some context on why you're having to revisit this targets? Juan Andrade : Yes Ryan, thank you. Thanks for the question. Thank you for recognizing the accomplishments too, by the way. Look, what we said at Investor Day back in June, is that 13%, essentially was the floor and what we actually said it's greater than 13%. Now obviously we can't predict the future. But what we are very much focused on are the drivers and aligning those drivers to be able to drive that 13% or better from that standpoint. We had a good start in 2021. We've been able to do that. And we're very focused with the actions that we've been talking about on this call on the underwriting of the cap portfolio, some of the actions that we continue to take on the insurance side to improve the profitability of the book to seek profitable growth. And all of that is aimed for leading returns. Right? That's, that's really the focus on here. And so again, I go back to what we said, if we'd like to achieve at least the 13% TSR over that period of time, and we're off to a good start. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. And then, I guess, just on the loss ratio, and reinsurance. Obviously there's the reserve charge a year ago. And yes, I guess it seems somewhat prudent to be to reserve the level of conservatism in 2021. Is there some aspect of 2022 that is potentially maybe less of a margin of conservatism that you might need to give us a little bit more confidence, and you want to show improvement ability to this year? Juan Andrade : Yes. So let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add more color. So look, I think we have been prudent in setting our loss fix. I think we have been prudent in how we analyze the reserves, the process that we put in place, we got a lot more insight, and more granularity into the data into the numbers to allow us to react. So I feel pretty good about that. When you look at the external environment, there's obviously things that as an industry, we all keep an eye on, right? You definitely keep an eye on social inflation. In the 2020, 2021 period, we definitely saw a drop in frequency and a slowdown in the courts. I'm not sure we have seen the courts completely open back up to full efficiency at this point in time. So you do keep an eye on some of the social inflation factors that are there, particularly as you're writing loss, long tail line. So that's an important component of that. The other component that you keep an eye on is real inflation, right? Material inflation, supply chain disruptions, all of these types of things, and the impact that that could have on trend. So from our perspective, what we have done is we certainly have adapted our loss trend selects for 2021, 2022 to make sure that we are continuing to select prudent loss picks given all those macroeconomic factors that are there. But in addition to that, we have continued to do a number of actions on the portfolio to ensure that the business that we're putting on the books meets our margin standards and it's very profitable, right. So you have heard from me, you have heard from Jim earlier in the discussion, some of the approach that we took throughout 2021 that we took to the one one renewal season that Mike Karmilowicz and his team has done also on the insurance side so that on-going portfolio management, that is just good underwriting is a key hallmark of all of this to ensure that we can meet the targets that we've set out. But with that, let me ask Jim to talk specifically about the loss ratio and reinsurance. Jim Williamson : Yes, sure. Sure, Ryan, this is Jim. I'll just, I'll just add a little bit more detail to give you a sense of the discussion we're having each quarter as we look at our loss picks. As you can imagine, we set those picks on the basis of assumptions around rate change, as well as assumptions around loss costs. And as Juan indicated amply in his comments, it's really that loss cost uncertainty, given the risk environment, we're in that that gives us pause around how quickly to react to good news on the other side of the equation on the rate side, and the underwriting actions that our cedings are taking. And what we have seen consistently quarter-over-quarter is, the rate component of that equation has come in better than we've expected, better than we planned for. We also believe that the underwriting actions and the re-underwriting and the segmentation and all the work our cedings are doing is ahead of our expectations. And so what we're looking for is the emergence of proof in our loss costs, as those lines mature, particularly on the longer tail lines, that would allow us to begin reflecting that, that good news. And it's still very early. I know, obviously we all want to see it emerge. But when we talk long tail, it does take years. I would say there are indications that would suggest we're seeing some of that. And I think, certainly my expectation is that we'll begin to see some improvement in the underlying attritional loss ratio for reinsurance, on the casualty side of the result of that. And then certainly the underwriting actions we've taken on property, particularly what we did at one one. I mean, all of those things ladder up to improving economics, which show up primarily obviously in the cat loss ratio, but I think will also benefit our traditional loss ratio and property. So a lot of good momentum. But we do have to be very prudent in terms of the timeline on when we recognize these things. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Jim Williamson : Thanks Ryan. Operator : And your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jeffries. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, I guess maybe heading on Ron\u2019s last question and until -- question earlier. So you ended 2021 with a consolidated report a combined ratio of just under 98 and head into 11% cat load, you're targeting a 6% cat load for 2022. So that essentially already gets you to that 91 to 93 combined ratio targeted range. So I guess my question is why wouldn't we see further improvement or see that target move down from 91 to 93 unless you see some headwinds coming on the other side? Juan Andrade : Well, let me start with that. I don't think we see any specific headwinds other than what we've already discussed, sort of in the macro environment, right. And we are essentially working our book of business, working our underwriting, working sensibly all the levers that we have to be able to meet and exceed on all those targets. And you clearly saw that in 2021, with the 14.7%, on the total shareholder return. But we are doing, I think, a very good job in shaping this book of business to drive very sustainable results over time. And a key component of that is what we've done on the catastrophes portfolio over the last few years. You saw the benefit of that in 2021. You saw the actions that we have been describing that we took at one, one 22. And I think all of that is a positive. So I'm not necessarily seeing any headwinds per se, other than just the macroeconomic environment being able to react to that. But what we control I feel pretty good about. Yaron Kinar : Right. Okay. And then I just want to further maybe clarify or try to better understand the guidance around the reinsurance top line growth, so 8% to 12% CAGR through 2023. Was the target, clearly you're well in excess of that as of the end of 2021? Is what you're saying ultimately, that the base is 8% to 12%, but if you see opportunistic, or if you see the opportunity to grow beyond that, you'll take it, or do you see maybe significant slowing over the next few years because market conditions potentially change? Juan Andrade : Yes Yaron, let me give you maybe a broader perspective and then I'll bring it down to reinsurance and I'll ask Jim to jump in as well to give you a few thoughts on growth and how we're looking at 2022. Number one, I would start by saying that we do remain very comfortable with the growth targets that we set out on investor day, last June. And as you pointed out, we're well on our way to achieving them, given the growth that we had in 2021. The second thing I would say is you've also seen us respond to opportunities in the market in both our underwriting divisions to grow our company and expand margins. So if the opportunity is there, we're able to take it. And the reason for that is pretty straightforward, right? We're nimble, we're agile, we have the relationships, the products, the platform, the capital, and the people to continue to be able to do that. So that gives us I think, a pretty good competitive advantage in a pretty dynamic environment to be able to do that. A third point I'll give you is that, and this goes back to the capital allocation discussion we were having earlier. We do have a diversified franchise that really works to our advantage. And the way we think about allocating capital is really who can give us the best economic return, as Mark said, is it insurance, reinsurance, or investments within the company. But keep in mind that our focus is always the same one. It\u2019s underwriting results. That's the core focus. That's what we really are driving. And it goes to also Ryan's question earlier about the margin. And so that brings us to the specific landscape of 2022. And so as I look at the landscape, I continue to see excellent opportunities for growth in primary insurance, both in the U.S., as well as internationally. And when we think about reinsurance, I've seen more selective, more targeted opportunities in that area. And we're going to pick our spots. Frankly, that's the bottom line. But I think what you're hearing from us is, look, we have traction in 2021 going into 2022. We have dry powder, as Jim mentioned earlier, and we intend to capitalize on the opportunities that we see. But at the end of the day, it's about underwriting income and underwriting results. But Jim, I don\u2019t know if you'd like to add anything? Jim Williamson : Yes, Juan. I\u2019ll just provide a little bit more detail around how we're executing within reinsurance to give you some flavor for this. We've as Juan has indicated, we've been pursuing a strategy that's very deliberate around what parts of the market we want to capitalize on. And in 2021, and really, in 2020, as well, we saw an opportunity with the significant shifts happening in the primary casualty markets, to participate alongside some of the best underwriters in the business in a really meaningful way. And so we've grown our in particular casualty pro rata business will end, in the fourth quarter, that's almost three quarters of a billion dollars in premium, it's very meaningful for us. And that allows us to participate in all those economic improvements that we've been talking about today. So that clearly drove a lot of significant growth. So if we translate that, that then into how we executed in one one, the strategy is very consistent, we saw an opportunity to be thoughtful about where we're deploying cat capacity that will result in an improvement obviously, in the cat loss ratio, which we view as a very good thing. We were very focused on where we deploy our cat capacity. We absolutely moved away from retro and aggregate structures, moved away from working layers, continued to support our core cedings, optimize the portfolio, particularly in the pro rata space, and also target some selective growth in cat with key customers. And then on the casualty side, we continue to see some really nice opportunities for growth in a very targeted way, with our core cedings on some programs that that are new or emerging in the market. And, and we and we certainly react to those opportunities as well. So it's going to be very consistent, it's going to be targeted. And it's going to be sort of scaled relative to the market opportunity that exists. And as Juan said, we have dry powder. We've created nice margins, and we can react if new opportunities emerge during the renewal seasons for the rest of the year. Yaron Kinar : Thanks for the helpful answers. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good Morning. Juan, first question on the prepared remarks Juan you talked about in the primary insurance segment. I believe you've talked about improving your analytics and improve your hit ratios on sales by a meaningful mark. Maybe you can kind of elaborate it seemed like a meaningful increase and the hit ratio thriving sales and is that new business since you're tweaking the underwriting [Indiscernible] is it the booking guys maybe more conservatively to on the onset? Juan Andrade : Yes Mike thanks. That's actually a very important thing you've highlighted because I think that also goes to the question that Yaron was asking a little bit ago about how we see the growth momentum into 2022. Look, I've said this before. Those who execute best when and distribution is a key component of all of that. So we're doing a number of things on the distribution area to be a lot more productive and be a lot more efficient. Number one, one of the things that we have done particularly in the U.S., is really expand our regional structure in the field, to be able to have more people on the ground, closer to our distribution closer to our brokers, to be able to plan our product offering and just be a lot more thoughtful about the solutions that we can sell, the solutions that are needed by them, etcetera. But backing all of that is essentially a shift into a much more quantitative approach to sales, where we now have very good data, very good intelligence at the underwriter level at the broker level, on what submissions we're getting, how we're looking at those submissions, how we triage those submissions, etcetera, etcetera. So the bottom line is that we're being much more effective at asking for what we want, what's within our risk appetite, and then being able to be much more efficient about what we bind based on what's coming into the funnel in the pipeline. And that's what you're seeing those hit ratios basically go up. So it's making this a lot more productive within our risk appetite. But I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit to that as well. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. This is Mike Karmilowicz, thank you for the question. I would just add a couple of things to that. Besides in distribution, we've been adding talent in addition, and changing the culture from more of a sales focus and customer mind set. So with that, the data analytics that Juan was talking about, we've been very much focused on simplifying our structure. So we can be a lot more efficient how we go to market in our offering is so we can bring it together and coordinate it more effectively, as an example. And what that's doing is we've developed sales pipelines. And we're being much more tactical with our distribution partners, which is allowing us to increase our hit ratio, and actually continue to improve, again, our success with our trading partners. So I think you'll see that as a continuation. So this is early days, but we're making a lot of progress in 2021 was an example of that. Mike Zaremski : Okay, that\u2019s great color. My follow up, is just an update curious on inorganic growth. Is Everest still open to any potentially sizable deals in strategic lines of business that could aid the long term hourly profile? Juan Andrade : Yes Mike, it's Juan. And again, thanks for the question on that. Look, I'm pretty consistent on this theme. And you've heard me say this before, which is our strategy is organic, right. That's what we can plan for. That's what we're executing. And that is an insurance that is and reinsurance at this point in time. Now, that being said, as Mark pointed out, we do have access capital. And if we do see an opportunity along the way, that's interesting. Obviously, it's something that we will consider, but I'm not considering or looking at sort of transformative type things, etcetera. This would be more a full time does it help us in a particular geography, a particular product line, etcetera, etcetera. But the strategy remains an organic focus strategy. Mike Zaremski : Understood. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your final question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you putting me in. Juan, in your comments you talked about a specific growth strategy for outside of North America. And I thought if we can get a little bit more color about the I guess regions lines, and specifically like the sort of risks that could hinder underwriting profitability in that new article as you penetrate those markets. Juan Andrade : Yes Meyer, thank you. It's good to hear from you. Let me expand on that a little bit. So basically, we have been talking about really, since the past year, about a pretty thoughtful and disciplined strategy to essentially be the next phase of our development on the primary insurance site outside of North America. So we already have a presence in the U.K. We participate both into retail and the wholesale market. We have a company out of Ireland, as well. And what we're thinking about doing already are doing is basically extending our Irish company, essentially into the continent of Europe, but only into a very limited handful of countries where we can add value, and where we can believe can make a difference given our value proposition. In Latin America, we have now a small operation out of Chile. And similar sort of thought process on that thoughtful discipline, we think, well, we can add value. And we now have a base of operations in Singapore at the same time. And the idea for us is not to go around the world planting flags. It's really to select a few geographies around the world where we see a need for our product given either market dislocation, competitor dislocation, and when we can add value. And that's effectively what we're trying to do. From the perspective of what products we're targeting, essentially it's an upper middle market play more so than anything else, depending on the geography that will dictate, sort of the product range. If you are looking at the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America it\u2019s going to be more of a first party play non cat. If you're looking at the more sophisticated markets in Europe, it's going to be a blend of first party lines and third party lines at the same time. But again, this is all a logical expansion from what we're doing in North America, and frankly, the success that we've had here. Meyer Shields : Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. One quick question, if I can. We're seeing across the industry a lot of growth in I guess what people would term financial lines. And usually that means cyber gross, reinsurance communities actually went down for the quarter in the year. Juan, something that you could talk about maybe a strategy for cyber or other factors that are driving that decrease. Juan Andrade : Yes, let me ask Mike Karmilowicz to provide some follow on that. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure, thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz here. But cyber for us is a portfolio we entered about a couple of years ago. It's a very small portfolio. But we've been very diligent on our focus. It's more middle market driven. And the opportunity that we've been able to accomplish is really focusing on two key things from our perspective. One is really making sure the requirements, whether it's MSA or whether the risk profiles have all the hygiene and things that are necessary to make sure it's a required suitable risk is one thing we've been very sure to sell. So the market itself, with all the different rate increases, we've seen, has allowed us to sit there and really focus on just the things that we want to go after. So it's a very small portfolio. We're not -- we're just picking the rate and looking for opportunities. But I don't see that market is slowing down anytime soon. And we continue to look for the right risk profile with the right requirements around cyber hygiene. And if they don't meet that, will continue to kind of just move forward and manage it effectively. Meyer Shields : Okay, fantastic. Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference over back to management for closing comments. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion today. As you can hear from our tone, we're optimistic about the opportunities before us. And we continue to build our company, accelerate progress and create value for our investors, clients and the markets that we serve. Thank you for your time for us today. And thank you for your continued support of our company. And we look forward to talking to you next in our Q1 results. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Jon Levenson : Good morning, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited 2022 first quarter earnings conference call. The Everest Executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I turn the call over to Juan Andrade. Juan Andrade : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Everest is off to a strong start in 2022 with first quarter results to reflect our relentless focus on profitability and margin expansion. Excellent performance across our underwriting businesses and investments contributed to a $406 million in net operating income and a 16.2% annualized operating ROE. Our discipline and resilience standout in a challenging and complex environment. We are a source of strength and stability in unprecedented times. The world is facing distorted volatility with the effects of the pandemic compounded by a web of macroeconomic, geopolitical and societal issues. Adding to this are climate-driven industry catastrophe losses. The first three months of 2022 were active, with estimated economic losses over $30 billion and insured losses over $14 billion. Significant events occurred in the quarter in Western and Central Europe, Australia, Japan, and the United States. The historically quiet first quarter, has not been quiet for the past six years. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, January, February, and March of 2022 were each in the Top 10 warmest months in the official observed record dating back to 1880. Amplifying these challenges is the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the upheaval, death and destruction facing the Ukrainian people. It is heartbreaking to witness the inhumanity and the cruelty that is unfolding in Europe. This war destabilizes global economic systems and financial markets and threatens democracy, peace and decades long efforts towards share prosperity, ever stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. As underwriters, the protection and stability we provide has never been more important. This turbulent time is when our unwavering focus on consistent disciplined execution is most important. Our focus was evident across our underwriting businesses in the first quarter. Both performed well and continue to lead with expanding margins and highly relevant, diverse risk solutions across lines and geographies. In the insurance business, our focus on delivering profitable growth, expanding margins, and best-in-class products and services, advanced our mission to be the markets global diversified insurer of choice. In reinsurance, we strengthen our global leadership position and maintain a laser-focus on diversification, reducing volatility and maximizing profit. This deliberate cloning of our portfolio is an ongoing strategy; we successfully applied to the April 1st renewal. We brought the same discipline to our investments which continued to perform well in the quarter. Our portfolio is diversified and well positioned for the current rising interest rate environment. During the quarter, we continue to embed technology in our underwriting processes, and to increase our capabilities, productivity and efficiency. Our momentum is powered by the extraordinary efforts of our people. They are the bedrock of our inclusive culture, and they drive our success. As we announced last week, we lost a very special colleague, with the passing of Don Mango, our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. Don was a legend in our industry and at Everest. I had the privilege of working with him to evolve our enterprise risk management framework to what it is today. He's going to be greatly missed by all of us. To carry Don's vision forward, we have appointed Ari Moskowitz, as Everest Group Chief Risk Officer. Ari is an accomplished leader with deep actuarial expertise. In his former role as our Reinsurance Chief Operations Officer and Chief Pricing Actuary, Ari played a key role in integrating risk discipline across the business and embedding it into everything we do. He has also helped to advance our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion as a founding member of our DEI Council. I look forward to working with Ari to continue advancing our risk management agenda. Let's turn to our financial results for the first quarter of 2022, beginning with our Group results. In the first quarter, we delivered $406 million in operating income with a 16.2% annualized operating ROE. This includes over $235 million in underwriting income, a significant improvement over prior year and $243 million in net investment income. Our combined ratio of 91.6% is a six-and-a-half point improvement over last year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.4% and our attritional loss ratio was 60%, a 70 basis point improvement over prior year. We also posted a competitive operating expense ratio of 5.8%. Rate continued to outpace expected loss trends in the first quarter, and our margins continue to expand. In addition to rate, we are also benefiting from additional premium on lines of business with inflation sensitive exposure bases, such as general liability, property, and workers compensation. And we also continue to benefit from intentional underwriting actions, to manage limits, and granular segmentation of our portfolio to ensure we are writing the most profitable business. Our focus on profitability and expanding margins is clear. We grew gross written premiums by 9%, 15% in our insurance division, and 6% in reinsurance. This growth was solid and broadly diversified in both of our underwriting divisions. Diversification allows us to target higher margin opportunities in each geography and line of business. We are not reliant on one geography or line to drive our growth and profitability. With regards to the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the war is an ongoing and evolving event. There are significant uncertainties regarding actual and potential losses and on whether health coverage would apply. We have completed a detailed coverage review of our businesses, and we have limited exposure to this work. To-date, we have received only one loss notice for a de minimis amount. Based on what we know at this point in time, we expect that any potential financial loss to Everest, as a result of these events, would be a manageable earnings item. But due to the high degree of uncertainty around both exposure and coverage, a reasonable estimation of potential loss is not credible at this time. We are continuing to work with our brokers and seasoned partners to assess any potential exposure. To sum, our Group results in the first quarter were strong and created meaningful momentum for the year ahead. The combination of our financial strength, capital position, outstanding market reputation, global offering, and deep relationships, uniquely positions Everest to capitalize on market opportunities. Let's turn now to our reinsurance results. In the first quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 6%. Growth was strong in casualty and financial lines globally, particularly casualty pro rata, which continues to be supported by strong underlying rate and underwriting and increased Everest participation on treaties. This is offset by deliberate and targeted reductions in our property/catastrophe exposed business as we further reduce the volatility in our portfolio. These actions resulted in significantly improved economics. The combined ratio was 91.4%, a 6.1 point improvement from last year and includes 110 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums from Australia floods, European storms, and tornadoes in the U.S. Our attritional combined ratio was 86.2%, including an attritional loss ratio of 58.9%, which is a 60 basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. Additionally, our expense ratio was 2.4% during the quarter. This continues to be a strategic advantage for Everest. We achieved excellent underwriting profit of $177 million. Driving this result is our priority on maximizing profits, while managing volatility. We successfully executed on this strategy during the January 1 renewal season, and continue to make meaningful progress throughout the first quarter. Specifically, we continue to grow our targeted classes of business and geographies. Our international treaty business grew by over 22% in the quarter. We expect this to become a bigger share of our business over time. Global facultative grew by 10%. We are making targeted investments to expand our facultative capabilities around the world, including industry-leading talent to our team. Those investments are already paying off. Casualty grew globally with our pro rata book up 48% year-over-year, and our casualty XOL book was up 8%. We continue to be measured and selective in our property and specifically in cat-exposed property. In the quarter, those lines decreased year-over-year. And we further owned our portfolio to maximize expected profit, while reducing volatility. We continued this strategy during the 401 review in property, total written premium, limits exposed, AAL, and our PMLs were all reduced and expected profit and dollars increase. This resulted in more profit for less exposure by any account that's an outstanding trade. We also achieved growth in our casualty book with higher participation alongside some of the industry's best primary underwriters. We expect conditions for upcoming reinsurance renewals to offer targeted opportunities for Everest to deploy capacity at superior margins. We move forward with the underwriting discipline and expertise to write profitable margins and we have the tools, talent and capital solutions to build continued profitability. Now let's to our Insurance division. We continued our thoughtful intentional long-term build with the insurance franchise with an absolute focus on underwriting profitability. Our combined ratio of 91.9% was excellent representing an eight point improvement from last year. The attritional combined ratio of 90.9% improved 130 basis points from a year-ago and including attritional loss ratio of 63.1%, a 120 basis point improvement from prior year. These improvements resulted in strong underwriting profitability of $59 million in the first quarter, a new record for the quarter. Our focus on profitability and margin expansion is clear. We have improved the attritional combined ratio by over five points since the end of 2019. We also have delivered robust and diversified growth in the quarter, up 15%, with gross written premiums once again over $1 billion. It's important to note that excluding strategic and intentional underwriting actions taken this quarter to reduce volatility and optimize the portfolio; our growth rate is higher at 25%. As we have said, Everest Insurance remains long-term growth mode. But we will reduce exposure where it makes sense as we continually reshape the portfolio to maximize profitability. Growth in the first quarter reflects our relevance in the commercial insurance market, and was driven by exposure increases, rate, strong renewal retention, and new business across our core segments, lines and geographies, most notably across our long tail lines. In the quarter, we achieved a rate increase of 9% excluding workers compensation and a total increase of 6% in our core P&C portfolio, notably, financial lines were up 15%, Umbrella Excess was up 10% and Commercial Auto was up 9%. Rate continues to exceed expected loss trends across all lines, with the exception of monoline guaranteed cost workers compensation, which now represents only 7% of our portfolio in the quarter. We made excellent progress against our objectives for the insurance business and we remain vigilant in driving and improving margins as we scale this business. There's a significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably in the global P&C market, and we're capitalizing on it. As we strategically expand our offerings, we continue to build out our global platform from underwriting to claims. This includes leveraging key technology and analytics to improve productivity, speed and accuracy and enhance the customer experience. We are finding new ways to innovate with improved structures and new offerings directly addressing gaps in the market. We continue to diversify and deepen our relationships with distribution partners globally. We are infusing analytics to take a more quantitative and metrics based approach to sales that brings the entirety of adverse to customers where, how and when they need us. As our first quarter performance shows, we've built the runway to advance our objectives, supported by our profitable underwriting operations, investments, market relevance, strong balance sheet, and our values based culture, all powered by a world-class global team. I am fully confident that Everest's ability to create exceptional value and deliver returns for our shareholders. As I said at the top of the call, more than ever, the world needs a partner it can depend on with the breadth of experience, capabilities, and dedication Everest brings to the market. In times of uncertainty, we are a source of strength and stability for our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the global community. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the financials in more detail. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. Everest had an excellent start to 2022 as we continue to make progress towards the objectives in our three year strategic plan. We had strong underwriting income, and another good quarter of good investment returns, leading to a 16% annualized operating return on equity. Most of our underwriting businesses and our investment portfolio contributed to the strong result this quarter. Now for a review of the first quarter results. For the first quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion representing 9% growth over the same quarter a year-ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 6% to $2.2 billion reflecting a 32% year-over-year growth in casualty, and an 11% reduction in property. Insurance grew 15% to an even $1 billion with notable growth in specialty casualty offsetting intentional underwriting actions to reduce exposure in property and optimize the profitability of our portfolio. Everest reported net income of $298 million equal to $7.56 per diluted share and a total shareholder return of 8.6%. On an operating income basis numbers are $406 million for the quarter, and $10.31 per diluted share, with an annualized operating return on equity of 16%. Included in net income and consistent with the 5% reduction in the S&P 500 during the first quarter, Everest experienced $109 million after-tax unrealized loss on our common equity portfolios. Note that these are not realized losses rather fair value declines, which flow through net income, thus lowering our total shareholder return during the first quarter. We incurred $115 million of pre-tax CAT losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums in the quarter. The Australian floods in the first quarter represent the largest flood loss on record for the Australian insurance industry at just over $3 billion U.S. Our CAT provision includes $75 million for this event. The other CAT events in the quarter were the European storms at $30 million and late March U.S. winter storms in the amount of $10 million. Of the total $115 million of CAT losses incurred in the quarter $110 million are in the reinsurance segment with $5 million from the late March U.S. winter storms within insurance. We also note that there is no net prior year development in CAT losses this quarter. We continue to see improvement in the attritional loss ratio across the Group, along with the lower expected CAT low given our emphasis on volatility reduction, and we reconfirm our assumptions for the Group combined ratio in the range of 91% to 93% for the full-year 2022 as well as for 2023 as noted in our strategic plan. Our first quarter 2022 GAAP combined ratio was 91.6%, which includes 4.1 points of CAT losses and no net prior year development. Our attritional loss ratio of 60% was a 70 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2021, with improvements in both the reinsurance and insurance segments. The reinsurance attritional loss ratio decreased by 60 basis points and in insurance it was 120 basis point improvement. In both segments, we continue to see rate outpace loss trend. Turning to commissions. The overall Group commission ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher year-over-year, largely driven by the 1.9 point increase in reinsurance commissions. The 24.9% acquisition ratio in reinsurance for the quarter is broadly in line with our expectations for 2022 and reflects the underwriting actions we've taken over the past few quarters notably the increased ratings of casualty pro rata business. The first quarter 2021 reinsurance commission ratio of 23% benefited from approximately a 120 basis points of non-recurring commission adjustments. The balance of the year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in business specs. For the insurance division, the acquisition cost ratio of 12.5% improved from the year-ago figure of 13.2% largely driven by increased ceding commissions. Everest continues to have a very competitive operating expense ratio of 5.8% for the quarter, versus our target of approximately 6% for the Group. Year-over-year the reinsurance expense ratio is lower 2.4% versus 2.9% driven by favorable operating leverage as we continue to scale the business. The insurance expense ratio is marginally higher 15.3% versus 14.8% and within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint. Regarding the impact from Russia's war on the Ukraine and in terms of reinsurance and insurance losses as Juan described, Everest has gone through an extensive analysis of exposures and coverages and at the present time, we simply do not have enough information to make a credible estimate of losses. Our investment portfolio is the one area where we have enough information for an initial assessment of losses. Given the repricing of Russian corporate securities Everest total direct exposures to these instruments is $15 million on a book value basis. And as of March 31, we booked a $9.5 million impairment with $5.5 million remaining in fair market value. During the first quarter of 2022, Everest continue to generate strong operating cash flow in the amount of $846 million. Our strong cash flow also has the benefit of allowing us to invest into the rising rate environment, increasing overall portfolio yield. Investment income for the quarter was $243 million, a strong start to the year with good balance between fixed income of $148 million and $100 million from alternative investments. Overall, our expected fixed income reinvestment rates are close to the 3% level. Everest's investment portfolio is well positioned for the rising interest rate environment. In addition to a high-level of operating cash flow within the existing core portfolio, we have a short passage duration of 3.1 years, and also nearly 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the first quarter of 2022, our net income tax rate was 8.3% benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams and thus outperforming our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders equity ended the quarter at $9.5 billion driven primarily by the first quarter rise in interest rates and negative impact on the value of fixed income securities, particularly those towards the short end of the yield curve. Two year treasuries rose 160 basis points, and 10-year treasuries rose 83 basis points during the quarter, resulting in an $811 million after-tax fair market value reduction. A relatively low asset duration of 3.1 years means that this change should amortize towards a more neutral balance over the next few years, and we hold our available-for-sale securities to maturity for the most part, and we benefit from strong profitability, underlying operating cash flow, and balance sheet liquidity. Therefore, I don't view this transitory decrease in book value as a constraint on our ability to grow or upon our financial strength. The resulting book value per share ended the quarter down at $241.52, a decrease of 5.9% adjusted for dividends of $1.55 per share. The book value per share excluding unrealized appreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $256.01 per share versus $252.12 at year-end, representing an annualized increase of 6.2%. Debt leverage at quarter end stood at 21.2%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the first quarter of 2022 in an excellent financial and strategic position. We have ample capital to operate in the current environment. And we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon. Jon Levenson : Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to two or one question plus one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have any remaining questions. Operator : Thank you. . Your first question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, maybe going back to your comments on the investment portfolio. So you gave us the new money rate, where do you see the current fixed maturity yield and what -- how much of the portfolio turns over in the given year? Mark Kociancic : So I say going -- thanks Yaron. Going back to the reinvestment rate, we're roughly at 3%. I see that increasing over time certainly with pressure upwards on interest rates; I see that only going up for us. On a current basis, the market value or the market yield is greater than the core and so there's upward momentum on that side. In terms of the portfolio itself I'd say roughly one-ninth to one-eighth converts to cash for 2022 and then when you combine approximately we would expect something around the $3 billion operating cash flow level for the year that's a significant amount of investable funds. And I'd also make reiterate the point that I made in my opening remarks that we've got roughly 20% of the fixed income portfolio in floating rate securities which will help that reinvestment yield. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. That's very helpful. And then my second question maybe for Juan, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about the cat loss this quarter. Can you maybe help us think about where, how you see catastrophes in this particular first quarter relative to expectations for the first quarter? Were they above normal, in line? Juan Andrade : Yes, Yaron. Thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, it was an active quarter, right, and we did end up as an industry having over $14 billion in cat loss. That translates to about $30 billion in economic loss. So I would say this is elevated for first quarter. And as I said, look, I looked at the data going back a number of years and all of this. And as I said that first quarter that typically is quiet hasn't been quiet right. So I would expect that $14 billion is definitely more active than what you normally would see. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Shanker : Yes, thank you. Looking at pro rata casualty business, prices are up for the underlying business from where they were a year-ago. But ceding commissions are also up, is the profitability between those two timeframes basically neutralized by the ceding commission. And has the ROI and capital being put into that part of the reinsurance business going up the same or is it lower than it was a year-ago? Jim Williamson : Yes, Josh. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. And it's a good one. Look, what we've seen and what we've been reporting is two factors that you described. There's a tremendous amount of margin creation happening in the primary casualty market driven by rates, but also by changes to limit re-underwriting, et cetera. And that's definitely playing through. And we're seeing that in our data. At the same time, cedings are looking to recapture some of that margin creation, the increased ceding commissions, and we've seen that dynamic play out. And what I would tell you broadly speaking, really only to Everest portfolio, our view is that trade is resulting in improving economics for us, meaning the improvement in the underlying market is exceeding growth rates and ceding commissions. Now, that's not true on every deal across the market, which is why the thoughtfulness and the selectivity of our underwriting is so important. And we measure each and every deal. And what we're looking for in this environment is margin expansion. And in those situations, where we see ceding commissions running ahead, and deteriorating margins, we're choosing not to participate. I would say broadly at this point, overall it's still a pretty rationale market out there that way. And so we see some real good growth opportunities continuing. Joshua Shanker : And then on the property and property/cat side, if you lower your volatility to cat exposures, but the capital that you are, isn't really being freed up because of that capital, obviously you're using for other items. Isn't there a possibility that the capital charges are low for the additional business, that you might be leaving money on the table as you trade volatility? I mean, I guess maybe not referring but that seems like you did that, you could use $1 of capital that's associated with casualty business, also to underwrite property and that yes, you've lowered your volatility, but you've also lowered your long-term earnings power. Jim Williamson : Yes, Josh, it's Jim again. Look we have a very robust capital modeling and risk management process that we operate at the Group level and we are really evaluating capital deployment across all of our lines at a very granular level between both reinsurance insurance and our investment portfolio. And we certainly take into account, total capital usage and optimization when we're making those decisions. So when we talk about deploying relatively more capital to casualty versus property, we're accounting for the fact that you do get diversification benefits, and you do get opportunities to deploy capital, in some cases, multiple areas. And so we're not seeing any area in the portfolio where we're failing to deploy capital at the most efficient level, when you look at the growth. MarkKociancic: Josh, it's Mark. Let me just add one remark to that. I think in addition to what Jim said, it's really more of a marginal movement. What we're seeing here with slightly reduced property/cat and an expansion on the casualty side. So as Jim pointed out, the portfolio is still very well diversified and we're very focused on accretive return expectations for everything we write in excess of our TSR. So for us, it's still highly efficient to proceed in this way. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hi, guys. Good morning. I was hoping on the insurance side, you can talk a little bit more about some of the re-underwriting actions you're taking. And whether or not we expect that to potentially impact the growth rate in that segment over the remainder of the year? Juan Andrade : Yes, Ryan, it's Juan Andrade. And let me start. And then I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to join. Look, I think the first point is, we still feel very bullish about the growth opportunities in insurance, as I said in my opening remarks. I think in some ways, we're only scratching the surface of the potential that's out there. And it's one of the reasons why we now have international expansion underway and frankly, while we continue to gain traction in the U.S. market. We're good underwriters. And what you saw us do this quarter is what any good underwriter does. You're looking at your portfolio, you analyze it. In some cases, there's going to be things that you like, and then have a good economic return and there's things that we don't like. And so therefore, you exit them, because we see better opportunities to deploy capital and move in that direction. So if you think back at that 15% growth rate for the quarter, some of that was impacted by the fact that we did reduce volatility as well in the insurance side similar to our strategy in reinsurance. And the other part of it was driven by one specific account that we decided to non-renew and move away from it. But that's the general theory. But we do feel very bullish about the growth rates in insurance. And I would ask Mike to maybe jump in and add some additional color. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks, Juan. Thanks for the question. A few things I would say. First off, as you know, our focus is basically always has been focused on underwriting with underwriting companies as Juan pointed out, and I would reiterate to you guys we've had 29 straight consecutive quarters of growth, most of those sales have been double-digit. We are very focused on cycle management, you see us talk about it with workers comp. We've taken actions to Juan's point on property in other areas. But I don't see this anticipating slowing us down. We see ample opportunity in the marketplace. We are well positioned with a lot of capital and a lot of trust. And so we will continue to execute that and where we see opportunity, we'll take advantage of it. But we don't foresee any of that changing anything we do every day. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Then on the reinsurance side, obviously a good margin quarter there. Just maybe a little more insight into, what specifically drove that. Was it a lower loss pick, as you're recognizing for portfolio's less volatile and better underwritten, or was there anything one-time in nature that helped? Jim Williamson : Sure, Ryan, this is Jim Williamson to give you some of that detail. Look, I think a lot of this is the result of some of the conversations we've been having with you over the last few quarters, which is we've seen very consistently, strong margin improvement in the underlying primary casualty market. That's rate that's limits, that's terms conditions, et cetera. And we've been very prudent in how we've revealed that improvement in our loss picks. And we've said, we've waited, and we've been waiting for that data to prove itself to start to see it in our numbers, et cetera. And so I think what you're seeing this quarter is the result of that prudence. And it's the result of that underlying improvement. And so on a year-over-year basis, we have seen an improvement in casualty pro rata in particular, and underlines as well, that have allowed us to basically settle on lower loss picks for those lines. We're still being prudent. We're still being disciplined. And we're still not taking full credit for the trends we see. But we are starting to flow through some of that margin. To give you a sense of quantum. On a year-over-year basis, we saw about a 140 basis point of margin improvement due to lower expected loss picks. And that was then partially offset by the change in mix, because if you look at Q1 2021 versus 2022 there is a dramatic change in our mix. We were about 60 :40 property casualty this time last year. It's closer to 50 :50 now, and that's certainly an offsetting factor as casualty carries a higher loss pick. But I think all of this is a result of the market trends we've been discussing. And we see those trends continuing as we head into the year and we continue to see pricing in excess of even elevated loss trends. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. I really appreciate that level of detail, Jim. Congrats. Jim Williamson : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. So my first question, if I look on a Group consolidated basis, right your -- the underlying combined ratio actually did deteriorate a little bit year-over-year. So I was hoping you could just give us a sense of just kind of an outlook for the accident, your ex CAT combined ratio. And then it seems like a big chunk of that deterioration wise was because the acquisition ratio ticked up around 120 basis points. Can you just give us a sense of the outlook for that acquisition ratio over the balance of this year? Mark Kociancic : So Elyse it's Mark. A few points that you asked there. So first of all, let me just start with the CAT and then we'll get into the acquisition ratios. On the CAT, I made this point last quarter that our expectations for 2022 with the CAT ratio for the Group of less than 6%. And so that's, I think, a meaningful reduced expectation versus last year, and definitely on a historical basis. So there is some reduction that that's expected there. On the acquisition ratio, I would say, a couple of points. We have, if I start with reinsurance. I would say it's broadly in line with last year, probably a little bit higher, you're seeing us trend at 24.9% here. Last year, I think we were in the low 24. That's principally because of mix of business. I did mention some of the one-offs we had in Q1 last year that would drive it. On the insurance side, we still see a declining net acquisition ratio. And that's a combination of things. You've got both ceding commissions coming in on certain lines of business, depending on the mix. And then just lower broker commissions versus our expectations on some of -- some other lines as well. But I'd say there's probably downward pressure in general on the primary side for acquisition ratio. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then my second question, on the reinsurance side, a little bit of a follow-up to Ryan's question, he talked about right, reflecting, just more of the improvement on the casualty side. And as we think about the mix shift to casualty and we also think about, like the impact that that can have on your margins, as we're thinking about going forward. I'm assuming that you guys still see right, the line of sight into kind of hitting, getting that segments that 91% to 93% combined ratio target. Jim Williamson : Yes, Elyse this is Jim Williamson. We would definitely reiterate our commitment to that target, and we're very confident in it. And it's a combination of factors. One, while casualty does carry a higher attritional loss ratio, and a slightly higher attritional combined ratio. Those numbers are coming down year-over-year, you see the improvements that we were talking about earlier flow through the book, and we began to reflect that in our loss picks. And while I cited a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year to our pick based on improved loss picks. It's higher than that for casualty. And so we're seeing that happen. And so that's critical. And then the other part, when you think about the total combined ratio to what Mark just said, which is for the Group, our targeted CAT loss ratio went down and that's also true of reinsurance. And so, when you ladder all that up, our expectation is, certainly that those won't be headwinds to achieving our goals. We're very confident on that. The other thing I would just say, and this is particularly important, I think, as we roll through the summer. We're still very much a leader in the property CAT market. And we take meaningful lines. We've been doing that in improved economics that 401 as Juan indicated in his opening remarks. We were able to take less risk by any measure, whether it's PML, AAL, et cetera. But we're going to getting paid more profit dollars, more expected profit dollars will flow to the bottom-line. And that will certainly have an impact on our traditional and ultimate combined ratio. And we see good opportunities through the rest of the year to continue to execute that strategy. So I think all of that comes together to give us a lot of confidence in the targets we set out. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. MikePhillips: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Juan, given the pretty positive comments and kind of trajectory of insurance segment, margins expanding and rates still at a loss cost trends. What's your appetite for kind of keeping more of the gross business over the next couple of years in the Insurance segment it's been pretty consistent for quite a while. Any thoughts on kind of moving that up over the next couple of years? Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And it's obviously something that we look at on a pretty regular basis, particularly as we go through all of our ceded reinsurance renewals on all of this, and we have made changes in our different treaty protections, et cetera, et cetera. The way we tend to look at this from a philosophical standpoint is, as we get additional rate, additional terms as we continue to feel very good about our own underwriting, then by definition, we would want to keep more of that net with a company and you see us doing that in certain lines of business. But we balance that against the volatility and the appetite that we want to have on any particular line of business at the same time. So the short answer is we are constantly making tweaks to that depending on our line of business, depending on the geography, et cetera. But we feel pretty good about where we are right now. And I would invite maybe Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit of color as well. Mike Karmilowicz : Sure, thanks. Yes, I would only add to that, that we continue as we continue to scale up a lot of our existing businesses and get more critical mass. To Juan's point you'll see his take on that we've done that already in a few different pockets. And I see that continuing as we continue to grow and gain scale. Mike Phillips : Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. And then sticking with the insurance, Juan, you talked about, again rate over loss trend, I think you said 9% rate ex-comp ahead of kind of the long-term loss trends, can you share with us how you're viewing that long-term loss trend, what number you're looking at there? And how is that changed given recent times and the world in increased risk? What do you use in for your long-term loss trend right now, is that 9% range? Juan Andrade : Yes, thanks Mike. Good question. Look, we feel pretty good about where we are, as I said that, I would actually say that rate is outpacing expected loss strength comfortably for us across the board. Right, so you're right, excluding comp, it's a 9% increase in rate that we saw in the quarter. And it's hundreds of basis points lower on that, where the trend would be basically. I would tell you that we have consistently updated our loss trends assumptions, really since 2019, 2020, 2021 upward reflecting higher loss trends in our pricing models and exit year loss trends. So we monitor that pretty closely. But I can tell you, we're comfortably above loss trend right now really, across all lines of business, with the exception of workers comp, which is the only one that I flagged earlier. Mike Phillips : Juan, sorry just to jump in and make sure I understood you. You said something about hundreds of basis points. Can you say that again of what you meant there? Juan Andrade : Yes, so look if you're running at a 9% increase in rate, our loss trend is lower than that by several 100 basis points, basically. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Hey, thank you. Juan, I was just curious, I appreciate the color you gave on Russia, Ukraine exposure. And there's a lot of uncertainty, I know right now and your exposure gets diminished. But I'm just wondering, as you think about your portfolio business, where are you kind of looking at where you're focused at? Where could there potentially be some exposure? Juan Andrade : Yes, no absolutely, Brian, I'm happy to give you a little bit more coloring and context and all of that. Let me reiterate though, something that I said in the earlier comments. We don't see this event as changing our profit objectives for the year. And I think that's probably the most important thing to take away. The other part of that is any loss estimate that we can give you or frankly, any of our competitors give you at this time is really purely speculative, right. And the reason for that is the worse ongoing physical damage and economic disruption are uncertain. It's changing in the investigation application of key coverage is still in its infancy, right. So that's essentially kind of where we are with all of this. As we have done that very detailed assessment of coverage that I talked about earlier in my remarks, I can tell you that for instance, on the primary side on insurance, we would have close to zero exposure in any event, very, very little. On the investment portfolio, Mike I'm sorry, Mark certainly talked about that. And you saw the impairment that we did in the quarter as well. And on the reinsurance side, we would have limited exposure and the way I referred to that is, we have very few like one or two former Russian scenes that are no longer clients of ours. So that's a very little exposure from that perspective. And then when we look at sort of lines that could be exposed to all of this, you certainly look at the some of the aviation lines that could be exposed. Although that's a relatively small business for us in the quantum of overall reinsurance. You could also look at potentially some marine lines that could be exposed. You could look at some trade credit, political risk type stuff. But we're much less concerned about that. And then you would look at some of the political violence covers as well. But we're also relatively small on that. So let me ask Jim Williamson to actually even go deeper into that, and just give you a little bit more granularity. Jim Williamson : Yes, sure, Brian, this is Jim. And I'll repeat a little bit of what Juan said and give you a little bit more detail. Because obviously, these topics have been heavily covered, there's a lot of speculation happening in the media around potential losses. On an aviation basis as Juan mentioned a relatively small, there's one small part of our book. There is significant uncertainty around the extent of potential loss, in terms of actual units of aircraft exposed and that numbers been changing. The application of coverage notwithstanding some of the posturing that you've seen, I think there are real questions related to which coverage will apply, and to what amount. We've also taken very significant actions in our own aviation book over the last two years, to position it to withstand shock losses in a much better way. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. On a marine basis, particularly given when you look at haul, we do have, and we know that there are trapped vessels in the Black Sea, for example, there's a lot of uncertainty about -- around the size of those vessels, whether they'll ultimately losses on those vessels, or on land cover, cold war et cetera, can also be in the marine area. There are properties in the Ukraine, obviously, that could potentially be exposed. As we've evaluated our book though, we don't really have concentrations of property in the area where the conflict is ongoing. And so it's both uncertain, but also at this point appears very manageable. On a trade credit and political risk basis I think our teams have done an outstanding job of managing that exposure. On the terms of those contracts, as you likely know give primary insurers a lot of options when there's dislocation in the market, there's been a lot of cancellation activity and so that exposure, that potential exposure has been shrinking by the day. We've also seen a lot of payment activity continuing in those contracts that haven't been canceled. So that's a good sign. And then, lastly, on political violence, again, that'll probably apply primarily to property exposures. In the Ukraine, there's a time limit on those covers. And again, as we've evaluated potential exposures, we don't have heavy concentrations in the major cities that have been subjected to the conflict in a meaningful way. We haven't had any reported losses other than one, which was less than $300,000, of potential loss from a political violence perspective. So you know, looking very, very manageable at this point, and tremendously uncertain. And so we're just continuing to have dialogue with our team. We're assessing it and we'll keep a very close eye on it. Brian Meredith : Thanks, that was really thorough. And then Mike, my second question, I'm just curious on your stock actually had a point this quarter where it's dropped pretty significantly, and I was little surprised that we didn't see more share price -- buyback in the quarter. Maybe just remind us kind of your thoughts on kind of capital here and Mark and kind of managing it? And do you have like, ability to kind of really go in the market and buyback some stock when we get this market volatility? Juan Andrade : Yes, Brian. So let me start and then I'll ask Mark to add. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we absolutely have the capability to go in and do buybacks. As you saw us do last year as well. Frankly, our stock was trading at a pretty good level. During the first quarter, there certainly had a bit of a dip as the war started sudden and you saw us come in, and we did have some buying activity, even though it was relatively small. But when you think about how we think about capital management, that philosophy hasn't changed in from what we have been articulating. Frankly, since I've been the CEO of this company. And we reiterated on our Investor Day last year, which is our number one priority, really is to privilege our underwriting businesses, as we see accretive growth opportunities and everything that we have been sharing with you this quarter and in past quarters, is that journey that we have to continue to expand margins improve the underlying profitability of this company, and you've seen us do that. So from our perspective that really is sort of priority number one. Beyond that absolutely we will consider share buybacks. We will consider other things at the same time. But let me ask Mark here to jump in. Mark Kociancic : Brian, not too much more to add to that. Although I will say that we see excellent opportunities on organic expansion right now within both insurance and reinsurance. Doesn't mean we can't do both. But there's a really nice marketplace for us in our view. And so I'd say capital is really being privileged for that right now. Operator : And your last question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thanks. So I want to start with one question on reserving. And I'm not quite sure how to phrase this. But if we break down reserving in sort of like a mathematical analysis, and then the judgments associated with that, can you break down I guess, the absence of enormous or significant reserves development into those categories? Another way that it is, are there indications of redundancies, that you're just hesitant because of elevated risk? Or are the indications not there? Jim Williamson : Sure, Meyer, it's Jim Williamson. Wanted to step back, just to reiterate our reserving process, which is very robust and has been strengthened meaningfully over the last few years. We're taking a very disciplined approach to reviewing all of our carried reserve positions every quarter. We've implemented a number of automated tools to allow us to do that. We are closely monitoring IBNR consumption at a very granular level across both reinsurance and insurance, by line, by accident year, et cetera. And then, of course, we have our ground-up reserve studies that were conducted, none were actually completed in the first quarter, but we will start getting completed reserve studies in Q2, and that's on an accelerated schedule, accelerated over last year, which was also accelerated from the prior year. So a lot of eyes on our carrier position. Now, when you look at you start slicing our IBNR, and our very reserved position in the all those pieces I described. You're clearly going to see movement on redundancies in some areas, deficiencies in some others, et cetera. But overall, I would reiterate what we've said in prior calls, which is we're very confident in the strength of our carrier reserve position. And we have seen no information, really, since the end of 2020. That would cause us to take any action, any meaning material action one where the other from a reserve change perspective. And so and that's certainly through this quarter. And so again, we'll continue to monitor it. And if that changes we'll certainly, you'll be the first to know. Juan Andrade : Meyer, the other thing. This is Juan Andrade. The other thing that I would add to what Jim has just said is keep in mind the discussion that we've been having about rate in excess of loss trend. And we have been saying that very consistently, really, for the past three years, essentially. And so by definition, you are building margin, and you are extending margin there. As we have also said before, we haven't taken that to the bottom line mainly because of all the issues that we're talking about with regards to inflation and severity, and all these other things at the same time. But from our perspective, and as Jim alluded to in his answer to Ryan with regard to the casualty loss pick, we do look at this. And we do change it, we do tweak it right. So it's only a matter of time, as we get the data as we examine things as things season that you're going to start seeing that coming into the bottom line. So I think that probably gives you also a more forward perspective. And again, bring it back to the rate versus trend discussion. Meyer Shields : Okay, that's very helpful. A second unrelated question, we're in an environment of at least, I think probably expected continued interest rate increases and your liability duration, have you set the mix towards casualty and also extending, when is the right time to really significantly increase your investment portfolio duration? Do you do it now; do you wait for further interest rate increases? Mark Kociancic : So it's Mark, Meyer. I think as long as we're broadly within alignment of asset and liability durations we're in a good spot. I don't think there's a lot of benefit when you look at where the yield curve is right now in terms of the short end and the flatness of really going long. So for us, it's really looking for kind of a mix of things. So you're obviously looking one, to match generally the duration of between or the ALM matching, in essence; two, yield credit quality, liquidity of the securities and the actual alpha you think you can capture in the securities that you're looking at specifically any specific asset classes. So we look at it probably more granularly. I wouldn't get hung up on for example; we got an asset duration of three, one this quarter and a liability of four. That yield curve is really not appealing to stretch it out for the extra basis points that we see. Operator : And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the call back over to management for any closing comments. Juan Andrade : Great, thank you for all your questions and the excellent discussion. I think as you can tell from our tone, we are optimistic about the opportunities before us. We definitely see a trajectory for continued growth and expanded profitability. We're continuing to build this company, accelerate the progress and create greater value for our investors, our clients in all of the markets that we serve. So thank you for your time with us today and we look forward to seeing you at the next earnings call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited second quarter of 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also joined today by other members of the Everest Management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt, and welcome to Everest. We're excited to have you on board. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Everest delivered strong results in the second quarter with positive momentum across our key objectives. We expanded margins in both of our underwriting businesses, and our insurance segment delivered another standout performance. We further scale our platform with strong overall and underlying results, continuing the positive trajectory for this business. In reinsurance, we seized opportunities to improve the diversification and profitability of our book, while reducing volatility. In a complex environment, Everest's global talent, disciplined underwriting and market leadership provide strength and stability to our customers. Our relevance and impact have never been more important. Improvements in underwriting profitability and operational efficiency, supported by our investment portfolio, delivered $386 million in net operating income and a 15.3% annualized operating ROE. We achieved these results through consistent and relentless execution of the strategy that was articulated at our Investor Day last June. Our strategy is to profitably scale our insurance platform and capitalize on our reinsurance leadership position to continue building a broadly diversified and consistently profitable company that provides leading returns in the sector. Our results quarter after quarter demonstrate we're accomplishing what we set out to do. Operational excellence is also a core component of our strategy. Efficiencies resulting from investments in our systems and technology make us more resilient, so we can respond nimbly to changing market conditions and cease emerging opportunities. Coupled with our ability to attract and retain great talent, this gives Everest a competitive advantage. This is increasingly important against the backdrop of macro volatility, achieving ambitious growth in profit today requires companies to operate with both the strong offense and defense. Our second quarter financial results demonstrates ever stability to strategically do both in a complex environment. I'll share some highlights now, first from the group and then for each of the underwriting businesses. Second quarter results for the group were strong and underscore the earnings power of our company. We grew gross written premiums by just over 10% in constant dollars. The growth was broadly diversified in both divisions and is supported by continued momentum in insurance as well as underlying margin improvement in both businesses. We continue to benefit from positive rate, exposure growth and deliberate portfolio management actions, keeping us ahead of loss trend. The combined ratio for the group is 91.8% and includes $85 million of weather-related natural catastrophe losses, primarily in South Africa, Canada, Europe and the United States. Overall, our catastrophe losses for the second quarter and year-to-date remained well below our cat loss ratio target for the year, despite an estimated $39 billion of insured industry losses in the first half of 2022. According to Aon, this level of natural catastrophe activity is 18% above the average for the 21st century. We also recognized a $45 million IBNR accrual for the Russia-Ukraine war. We have limited direct exposure to the Ukraine and expect any potential losses to be a manageable earnings event. Mark will provide additional details in a moment. The group attritional combined ratio was 87.2%, a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year. This includes a 1.9 point year-over-year improvement in insurance. The group attritional loss ratio also remained strong in the quarter at 59.8%, with continued improvement in both segments. The $240 million in underwriting profit for the quarter is a direct result of continuous portfolio management. Net investment income for the group was $226 million, balanced between fixed income and alternative investments. Now turning to our reinsurance business. Reinsurance gross written premiums were up in the second quarter by over 5% in constant dollars. Our growth is broadly diversified, which allows us to target higher margin opportunities in each region and line of business. We are not reliant on one market or one product to drive our growth and profitability. For example, second quarter growth is driven by our international operations, particularly our casualty book, where we're focused on key seasons for achieving strong underlying profit improvement and results ahead of loss trend. We also grew our global facultative business and our mortgage reinsurance business, where there has been a significant pickup in deal flow. This growth is partially offset by a reduction in property pro rata as we continue to optimize that portfolio. I talked about the advantage of flexibility. This is where our ability to manage market dynamics makes a meaningful difference in the quality of our portfolio. The reinsurance attritional combined ratio was 86%, including an attritional loss ratio improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year to 58.8%. This contributed to a strong underwriting profit of $175 million, supported by successful midyear renewals. With respect to these renewals, market conditions have steadily improved over the course of 2022. We are seeing improved economics for property cat. Everest's position as a preferred market has allowed us to reposition our participation in key programs, further away from frequency losses and achieve better expected profit or reduced cat exposure. Our underwriting teams deploy capacity with discipline. Casualty market remained stable with some tightening of terms driven by market concerns over social inflation and emerging risks. The market is showing signs of discipline, especially in pro rata, where cedes appear to be stabilizing. Our underwriting teams are data-driven, carefully tracking and analyzing trends to ensure we manage the underwriting cycle. In summary, we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as we maintain our strong underwriting discipline. We are well placed going into the January renewal, and we expect further improvements in the market. Now for our insurance results. During the quarter, we continued to deliver on our strategic objectives, generating record underwriting profit and continued growth, while investing in our talent, technology and analytics. We achieved strong gross written premium of $1.2 billion, a quarterly record for our insurance division, up over 20% in constant dollars. This growth was broad and diversified across our target product lines, channels and regions. We had strong growth in our U.S. casualty, specialty lines and in our international business. We also continue to see significant opportunity in the E&S space where we are well positioned. Growth was driven by several factors, increases in underlying exposures across many lines of business, including general liability, property and workers' compensation, strong renewal retention and positive rate in excess of loss trend across the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved a rate increase of 7.3%, excluding workers' compensation, and a total of 6% with high single-digit increases in property, professional lines, umbrella and commercial auto. These rates remain well above pre-pandemic levels. It's also important to note that in addition to renewal rate change, there are other levers we deploy to ensure that margins continue to expand, such as coverage terms and conditions, limits management and attachment points, risk selection, new business pricing, which continues to be higher than renewal pricing, and the benefit of additional premium from inflation-sensitive exposure basis. Insurance growth was partially offset by continued portfolio management, including our reductions in U.S. property catastrophe, where we achieved an approximately 36% reduction in our gross 1 in 100 U.S. Southeast Wind PML over the last 12 months. In addition to robust growth, insurance continued its strong profitability trend. We achieved a record low attritional combined ratio of 90.2%, approximately 2 points lower than second quarter 2021 and with a 1.5 point improvement in the attritional loss ratio. These results are aligned with our financial targets and build on our continually improving attritional combined ratio trajectory since the end of 2019, where we have gained over 6 points of underlying margin expansion in the combined ratio. This is a direct result of the consistent and cumulative actions I just spoke about. These improvements resulted in $66 million in underwriting profit, the second best quarterly profit in our insurance division's history. We also made solid progress in the quarter with important milestones that advance our international expansion strategy. Everest insurance received regulatory approvals to operate in Singapore and Chile, where we are officially open for business. Asia and Latin America are both significant opportunities. We are well positioned with the talent, customer-first platform and proven track record to cease this opportunity in new markets. I have personally witnessed the excellent reception of our presence by local brokers. We will continue to bridge gaps in regions around the world, where we are uniquely positioned to serve clients and brokers with our strong balance sheet and broad suite of insurance products and capabilities. Our leadership team is driving the strategy forward and Everest continues to be a net acquirer of talent. During the quarter and since the beginning of the year, we welcomed a significant number of new colleagues, all of whom are accretive to our organization and inclusive culture. From underwriting to pricing and claims, we are innovating across the entire organization to deliver a world-class experience and value to our stakeholders. Our second quarter results demonstrate that Everest is nimble and strategic, diversified and well positioned to perform in any environment. We entered the second half of the year with momentum. We are leveraging our talent and the full breadth of our enterprise to strengthen every area of the business and bring our partnership to more people and businesses around the globe. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the financials. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another solid quarter, rounding out a strong start in the first half of 2022. The company reported operating income of $386 million or $9.79 per diluted share in the quarter. The operating ROE was 15.3% for the quarter, while total shareholder return, or TSR, was 6.6% year-to-date. We improved our attritional loss ratios in both segments, while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars as pricing and terms remain attractive in virtually all of our core lines of business. Based on the fundamental performance of the business year-to-date, our team continues to execute well, and we remain on track to achieve on the goals we set out in our strategic plan despite macro volatility. Looking at the group results for the second quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.4 billion, representing 8.1% growth year-over-year or 10.3% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio was 91.8%, which includes 2.9 points of losses from natural catastrophes and 1.5 points from the Russia-Ukraine war. While significant uncertainty remains around the Russia, Ukraine war, we felt it prudent to put up a provision, which is all IBNR, given the lack of claims to date and the ongoing nature of the event. The provision was driven by our marine, political risk and trade credit books in the Reinsurance segment. There is no direct exposure in our Insurance segment. The group attritional loss ratio was 59.8%, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the Insurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group's commission ratio improved 20 basis points, 21.6% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio, which remains a competitive advantage for Everest, was 5.8%. Moving to the segment results and starting with Reinsurance, the Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 2.5% to $2.2 billion or 5.2% in constant dollars. Growth was driven primarily by casualty pro rata and strategic growth in international lines. The combined ratio was 91.8%, which includes 3.7 points related to natural catastrophes and 2.1 points related to the Russia-Ukraine war, as mentioned earlier. The attritional loss ratio improved 30 basis points to 58.8% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. The commission ratio was 24.8%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 2.4% as earned premium grows, and we remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire platform. Moving to Insurance, where we continue to build significant momentum, gross premiums written grew 19.6% to $1.25 billion or 20.5% in constant dollars in the quarter. The combined ratio improved 2 points to 91.5%, primarily driven by a 1.5 point reduction in the attritional loss ratio to 62.7% as rate continues to outpace trend further supported by our focus on risk selection and favorable loss experience. The commission ratio improved 50 basis points, largely driven by business mix and increased ceding commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 15.1%, within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. Finally, to cover investments, tax in the balance sheet, net investment income for the quarter was $226 million, and we are starting to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio. Overall, our reinvestment rate improved sequentially from 2.9% to 3.7% during the quarter and today is well north of 4%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, that 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the second quarter of 2022, our operating income tax rate was 10.1%, benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams, thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $8.9 billion, driven primarily by the second quarter rise in interest rates, particularly toward the long end of the curve. There was a corresponding negative $717 million impact on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities. Year-to-date, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $715 million during the quarter, and book value per share ended the quarter at $224.59 per share, a sequential decline of 6.3% adjusted for dividends of $1.65 per share. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities, stood at $257.27 versus $256.01 per share at the end of the first quarter, representing an annualized increase of 2%. Debt leverage at quarter end stood at 22.5%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the second quarter of 2022 in a strong position. We have ample capital to operate in the current environment, and we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our second quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. . Operator : . Our first question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : First question, just looking at the reported combined ratio in the first half. I think it's tracking a little below the midpoint of the 91% and 93% guidance range. That said, I do think that the second half of the year tends to have a little more catastrophe losses in it. So how confident are you in achieving that 91% to 93% target? Juan Andrade : Yaron, this is Juan Andrade. Look, I think we feel very confident about it. And the reason I say that primarily it's really all the reductions we have done in our property catastrophe book, right? If you look at our comments that we have been making consistently, we have been managing the volatility down, particularly in the reinsurance book in a pretty significant way. If you look at our investor presentation, you see our trading range and where we are now compared to where we were in 2017, '18, '19, even '21 and '20. So I think that part of it is a big help. If I think about the insurance division as well, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we have already taken down our gross PML in the Southeast by about 36% in the first half of the year. And so those steps, I think, are critical, frankly, to us being able to achieve that 91% to 93%. But I would invite maybe Mark to add any additional comments to that as well. Mark Kociancic : Yes. So in addition -- Yaron, in addition to the PML reductions that we've seen on the cat side, I think we're making some solid progress on the attritional loss ratios as well. And you can see that evidenced over the last several years, 5 years in particular when you look at insurance on a stand-alone basis. And so we don't see that changing. We feel like we've got a lot of momentum, good process, a lot of opportunity in the market, and we feel good about it. Yaron Kinar : Understood. And then my second question, also a guidance-related question. So I think your premium CAGR targets, 3-year targets, are for 8% to 12% growth in reinsurance, 18% to 22% in insurance. I think you were a bit ahead of target in '21, a little below target now in '22, so -- particularly in reinsurance. So with that in mind, how confident are you in those 3-year targets, especially as there is growing concern around a recession? Mark Kociancic : Yes. They're not targets. They are assumptions rather that we had in place for the 3-year plan. So in other words, to achieve the plan itself, it's not like we have to grow at that level. We're very much focused on total shareholder return profitability target for the group. To your point, when you look at the assumptions that we had 8% to 12% for reinsurance and 18% to 22% on insurance, last year, we exceeded those by a significant margin, pretty close to 25 points of growth last year for both divisions. This year, insurance is, within its 18% to 22%, I think we'll get there. The reinsurance side is a little bit lower, but that's not a problem for us. We've done a lot of things there, which I'm sure Jim will articulate as we go on through the call, but we can certainly achieve our objectives even if premium growth is somewhat muted because we're very much focused on profitability. Yaron Kinar : Understood. And maybe just one clarification there. The assumptions you were using were those on constant currency? Or is those absolute? Mark Kociancic : Well, yes, those would be constant currency. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My question is on the capital side of things. You guys mentioned that you have ample capital. We didn't see any buybacks in the quarter. So just hoping to just get an update on how you guys are balancing using your capital for organic, inorganic growth as well as capital return from here? Mark Kociancic : Elyse, it's Mark. Let me take that one. So share buyback, you're right. We didn't have anything in the second quarter. It's still very much an option for us. I think I put in my monologue, to your point, the ample capital to support the business. So we have, as I said, ample capital, we still think that there's a lot of attractive opportunities in the market to grow. You're seeing a very nice growth in the insurance space, which we expect to continue significantly, especially on the international side. And so that's where opportunities for us really present themselves in an attractive way. If there is a point in time where we feel the buybacks are -- provide that much more value in addition to balancing our franchise development, we'll execute them. There's no issue on our side for that. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up is a margin question, but a little bit of a different way, right? You guys laid out a 91% to 93% combined ratio target at your Investor Day. That included right around at the midpoint, right, a 6.5 point cat load. So I back that out, right, that would be an underlying of 84.5% to 86.5%. You guys were 87.3% ex-Russia, Ukraine through the first half of this year. And you did mention some things like mix, right? If you're shifting away from property, right, that would perhaps lift your underlying, and we're also dealing with higher inflation trends and when you put this guidance in effect. So can you just walk through the drivers of kind of hitting the mid-80s from an underlying combined ratio perspective that's included within that 3-year plan? Mark Kociancic : Yes. So there's multiple components here to your point. So you've got everything from the attritional loss ratio, acquisition ratio, the cat load itself. And I think back in February for the Q4 results, we made a remark that the cat load of 6% to 7% that we had in the Investor Day presentation last June was likely to trend down as we start to reduce our PMLs on the cat side. So that number, I think, is firmly less than 6% in our anticipation for '22 and probably for the foreseeable future. So that's going to provide some relief within that 91% to 93%, but you're also seeing a couple of other things. On the mix of business, you're seeing a shift. On the reinsurance side, for example, from a 60-40 property, casualty ratio in the book is something that's closer to a 50-50. And so that has its own dynamics in terms of the prospective attritional loss impact overall. When you take into account the mix of business, and then the types of treaties were underwriting and the focus on profitably, we feel very good about the 91%, 93% range, even though we have some meaningful changes here, both in the level of expected cat and the proportion of longer-tail business. So we're comfortably in that 91% to 93%. Operator : The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer Shields : Two quick questions. One, in your introductory comments, you talked about growing in international casualty. And I was hoping you could update us on social inflation internationally, both whether or how it's trending and how it compares to domestic social inflation? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Meyer. And that comment was specifically related to the Reinsurance segment of our business, where we continue to see pretty significant opportunity. And as I said in my prepared remarks, what we're doing is very consistent with our prior strategy of partnering with specific seasons that we understand, that we know and that we also see getting rate in excess of loss trend. So from that perspective, we're pretty confident about that book of business. With regard to the social inflation question, I think that's more of a U.S. litigation issue than it is outside of the U.S., even in developed markets of Europe. So when we think about that particular driver of loss in the book, we tend to think about it more from a North America standpoint that we tend to think about it from an international standpoint. Meyer Shields : Okay. No, that's good news. The second question -- sorry, let me try that again. You mentioned, I think, that ceding commissions for the Reinsurance segments are leveling off, and Mark noted ceding commission is actually helping to some extent the insurance acquisition expense ratio. Should we expect that benefit in insurance to level off? Or can we see different dynamics in these 2 segments? Juan Andrade : Yes. So maybe a broad comment on that, and then I'll ask my colleagues to jump in as well. So I think on the comment about the market appearing to settle down on cedes. I think that is right. And I think that is what we saw during the quarter, primarily as our cedents are thinking about the same things that we're all thinking about, the risk environment, inflation, et cetera, et cetera. So from that perspective, we see the discipline that's going on with the primary companies, and we definitely see less of an uptick, if you will, on cede commissions. With regard to the insurance, I think that's largely a function of mix and where we saw the growth come in, in the quarter. I think you will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but we happen to see some very good growth in particular lines of business where we do get decent cede commissions from that, and that's really where you saw the offset. That's also been a little bit of a trend. If you look at the last 2 or 3 quarters, we've also been benefiting from that essentially. And that's part of our portfolio management to essentially drive our lines of business within the primary insurance business to areas where we think we can get better profitability. But let me ask maybe Jim Williamson to add a little bit of color on what he's seeing in the market from a cede commission standpoint. James Williamson : Sure. Yes, Meyer, this is Jim. Look, I think one of the comments that Juan made, obviously, that you're picking up on is this idea that ceding commissions are starting in the process of leveling off. We certainly saw that in the U.S. and some of our international treaty casualty businesses, pro rata ceding commissions are beginning to level, and that's certainly a very good thing for us. But I would say that, that's a broad comment. When you get under the covers of that, there are clearly still areas of the market where ceding commissions are increasing. And so the mix component, particularly when you relate it back to what you expect out of our insurance business is going to be very important. The other thing that is critical, and it's something that I commented on last quarter is, this also varies deal by deal. And there's no question that there are still cedents who are achieving some increases in those commissions. Oftentimes, that makes sense on the reinsurance side for us, and we'll write it. Sometimes it doesn't and we won't write it. But I think that's also a factor you have to keep in mind when looking at the trajectory in our Insurance division. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Josh Shanker : Yes. And  little bit probably misrepresenting things. If we go back to the last few years, obviously, the marketplace and you have decided that property re is less attractive and property cat is less attractive than it used to be. But it's gotten to the point where it seems like a number of your competitors are pulling out, making an opportunity. At the same time in your prepared remarks, you spoke about moving away from frequency risk. And I don't want to give away the secret sauce. But where do you get paid in property cat effectively? And what has to happen for this market to be attractive again instead of the market where largely you're cautious about putting capital to work? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Josh. And I think you broke up a little bit, so let me make sure that I answered the question that you're asking, if I -- this is one, by the way. Look, I think if you go back to the strategy that we have been articulating, a big part of that is really sustainability of earnings going forward. And a big component for us to be able to accomplish that is really to reduce the volatility in our earnings, which basically has come from property cat and the impacts of climate change and the storms that have been out there basically since 2017. And as you heard from my prepared remarks this morning, they certainly haven't abated, right? I mean whether you believe Munich Re's number of $34 billion or Aon's at $39 billion, it's still been a pretty active first half of the year. And then if you look at our cat losses for the first half of the year, and they're certainly underweight based on our market share and what we've been able to accomplish. So that part of it, we feel pretty good about the execution of the strategy. The other thing that I said in my prepared remarks is that we're basically getting much better pricing, much better risk-adjusted returns for total exposure -- for less exposure in total, right? And I think that becomes pretty relevant to us. The other point that I would make, Josh, is we have articulated a trading range that we feel very good about for property cat, thinking about earnings at risk and capital at risk. And our objective is to trade within that range. As we trade within that range, we're also looking at the environment that's out there for us, and we're positioning our book to be further away from lost higher layers. Given the shortage of capacity that's out there in the market, we're actually getting a pretty good rate online on those layers that are further away from loss. So for us, that's been a very good economic trade. But let me ask Jim Williamson to add a little bit more color on that for you. James Williamson : Yes. Josh, thanks for the question. It's Jim. In terms of the first part of your question on where we think we get paid, that is a little bit of the secret sauce, as you say, but to give you some broad comments and echoing a little bit of what Juan said, I think at the lower end of a lot of programs, what we saw is the impact of climate change, in particular, is just creating a frequency of smaller cat losses that make those, in our view, very unattractive risk to be taking. And so we've, for the most part, moved away completely from what we consider more frequency layers, call it, 1 and 3, 1 and 4 attachment type point. And then at the very top of programs, that's where there's obviously significant capital market competition as well as the opportunity for real excess volatility, particularly if you start looking at things like aggregate structures, et cetera. So it's really between those 2 points where we see excellent opportunities that we've been able to . And in some cases, that includes growing with our core clients. And then to the second part of your question on what needs to happen for our approach to change. Juan obviously laid out the idea that we've articulated the trading arrangement that we're comfortable with for the long term. That's very important. We are in a very targeted way given the hardening that we've seen in the market, deploying additional capacity with our best clients. But again, that's very targeted. I would say that in many places in our portfolio, we're perfectly happy getting paid more for the same or, in many cases, less risk, and I think that's very accretive, and that's been a major strategy. But then the last thing I would just sort of remind us all about is the idea that the reason the market is hardening is because people are being very thoughtful about deploying capacity. And so when we get asked the question of, well, why not deploy more capacity into what is a really good market? You just have to remember, the reason the market is really good is because people are not deploying a lot more capacity into it. And so we're thoughtful about that dynamic. Josh Shanker : And this is going to be a bit of a  question, I guess. But I mean 2006 is too much to ask for. But if pricing were at where it was in 2010, 2011, does that kind of market give you any incentives to reembrace volatility? James Williamson : Yes. Josh, it's Jim again. I'll just reiterate what we said, which is in a situation like that, we have articulated a trading range of volatility that we're willing to accept on an earnings at risk and a capital risk position. But that's a long-term strategy we're pursuing. We don't plan to change it. And the other thing I would say is in a situation, the more dislocated property rates become, the more I'm getting paid for the exposure I'm already taking. That's more margin. And in many cases, and we've seen this in the more recent renewals, where we've taken capacity off the table, but total renewed premium increase. So not only are you getting more margin, you're getting more total premium for less exposure. We really like that trade. Juan Andrade : And I would build on that a little bit, Josh, by saying that if you go back and look at the trading range that we've put out there, there's flexibility in there, right, to the comments that both Jim and I just made. We have capacity, we have the dry powder. And it's just a question of the trade, right? If it's attractive for us on a deal-by-deal basis, we can deploy capacity. And as Jim said, we have for specific risks, but we will stay within that trading range. The key strategy for us is a broadly diversified company that can deliver sustainable earnings, right? And I think we got to keep that in mind and that's really what we're executing against. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of me for you. First, one, I'm just curious, maybe get some updates on you with respect to your loss trend assumptions, obviously, a company that you're pretty familiar with increased your loss trend assumptions. And on that topic, too, if you've got a 7.1% rate, I know you said there are some other things that are happening here. What's your cushion right now rate versus where you think trend is running right now or could potentially be here soon? Juan Andrade : Yes, Brian, let me give you my thoughts on all of that. And look, I think first, it's important to remember that we have been consistently prudent in our loss pick selection process. And I think that's important to remember. As I've said in prior quarters, really starting in 2020, we deliberately strengthened our current accident year loss picks to reflect the heightened risk environment that we've been operating in. But the other important point is that we've also been consistently achieving pricing in excess of the assumptions that we built into those loss picks. And we haven't lowered our loss picks as we've talked about in prior calls. So we're thoughtful about the environment, and we're thoughtful about how we manage through it. And frankly, this has been a prudent choice, and I'm glad we did it. In addition, if you think about back to the end of 2019, we have been watching and increasing, our loss trend assumptions also in reaction to supply chain disruptions, social inflation, general material inflation, and we responded very quickly to those signals. And those changes drive our pricing and our underwriting decisions. So this is something that we started early in '20, '21, '22, and we have a process where we very frequently throughout the year, revised those loss cost assumptions. But despite the increase in those loss trend assumptions that I just articulated, our pricing performance continues to outpace that. And that's the case for both written and earned pricing, but it's also important to note that new business pricing also remains stronger than what we articulated for renewal pricing. So all of these things are important to keep in mind. The other thing is that it's important to note the growth in exposures that's resulting from inflation, right, especially when you think about lines of business like general liability, workers' compensation and property, that also has a mitigating effect on loss cost because we're getting additional premium for that exposure. And so when you think about the exposure growth, our rate achievement, this increases the margin further in our favor in excess of current loss trends. And I think that's very important to keep in mind because it's all these things together. And finally, the last comment I would make is that beyond rate, beyond exposure growth, you have all the things that I talked about in my prepared remarks today, but also in prior calls, things that we're doing from a portfolio management, including improving terms and conditions, higher deductibles, all of that, limits and attachments. All of that helps to sustain our underwriting margin. And so from our perspective, the final thing I would tell you is that since we are fairly well diversified, and you just heard it in the cat discussion with Jim and I, we can actually shift our capital to where we see the best opportunity from a pricing and terms and conditions standpoint, and that is what we're doing. That's basically what's creating the margin that you're seeing from us quarter after quarter. So again, I think it's a combination of the increased pricing, exposure growth and all the underwriting actions that we're taking, that are keeping us above the current loss trends. Brian Meredith : Great. And then Mark, I'm just curious, looking at the investment portfolio, obviously, a big increase in fixed income investment income this quarter. How much of that kind of increase that we saw in the yield, do you think is directly related to the  ? And can we expect a continued kind of big increases in your investment yields here? Mark Kociancic : Well, it's difficult to say what the pace is. But clearly, we've got a tailwind behind us. And there's, I think, several factors pushing it higher. So we've got a new money yield that's well into the 4s in the portfolio. Roughly $3 billion of our fixed income portfolio is converting to cash through maturities and interest coupons over the next 12 months. And then you've got a run rate on operating cash flow, which is a little over $3 billion a year, annualized 12 months, I guess. So if you take those factors into account, that's going to provide some sense on what the yield pickup is going forward. I think we also have some ability to extend duration as well and pick up a few points on that. So I see still a good trajectory on that. What's unclear is just how persistent the current rate environment is going to be. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. One, I'm just curious, going back to my last question I was going to ask you. Are you willing to give us what you think trend is running right now? Juan Andrade : Look, we don't really disclose our -- how we price. What I've articulated in the past, it's running mid to slightly above mid-single digits. Operator : The next question comes from Mike ops from Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : First question, look, you guys aren't the only company that's talking about reduced volatility and kind of trimming back on property cat and you're growing nicely in reinsurance on the casualty side. I guess, especially in light of Juan, your earlier comments and a pretty common comments on social inflation and Juan, you even said emerging risk. Can you just help us think about how -- what specific steps you're taking in reinsurance casualty to kind of mitigate any surprises on the negative side there? I don't think pricing is what we hear on the property cat side, on the casualty side and reinsurance and more risk there. So just help us think about how -- what you're doing specifically mitigating risk in the near term for that business? James Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. I'll really break that down into 2 things. The first is what our cedents are doing. And then the second is maybe a little repetitive around our loss pick process. But one of the things to keep in mind is most of the casualty growth we've been experiencing is through quota share participation alongside of our cedents. And so you really need to examine strategies that they're employing to stay ahead of loss trend and to ensure that current accident year picks can be sustained, particularly as you get into an environment where there's material inflation happening. And so what I would emphasize for you and some of what we've already discussed is, we've seen obviously a significant and extended period of time where rates have been going up meaningfully. We're years, 3.5 years into a rate on rate on rate environment, and that is very meaningful. We've also seen really significant reunderwriting actions by many of our cedents. That's risk selection, that's attachment points, that's limits, that's terms and conditions. And that builds a significant amount of underlying margin into the treaties that we're writing. And then obviously, in our own underwriting process, we're very thoughtful about which cedents we partner with. We're choosing them very carefully, and we price all of our deals from the ground up to ensure that there is strong margin in those deals. And that margin calculation that we're performing includes our forecast around what's going to happen with inflation, whether it's social or material. And as we indicated earlier, we were very quick to react to changing trends around inflation and all of that gets factored into our pricing. So I think that's really critical. And then the second part of it obviously gets back to what Juan was discussing earlier, which is our loss pick process. We've been very, very prudent about strengthening loss picks early on in this cycle. We've obviously performed better than expected against those picks from a pricing perspective. And again, that's not reflecting all the underwriting I described as pricing has outperformed assumptions, but we haven't reacted too quickly to that price improvement by lowering our pick. So we're kind of going in with some very prudent loss picks. And it's really the combination of those 2 factors in our view, gives us the confidence we need to continue to sustain that casualty book. Michael Phillips : Okay. Switching over to insurance, if I could. You've grown nicely in your specialty, casualty segment there. And it's not just this quarter. So it's been going for a while. So I guess, quickly, just to make sure there's nothing one-off in this quarter, which I assume there's not. But can you maybe drill down then a little bit more detail and kind of some of the specific sublines that are inside what you call your specialty, casualty? Michael Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Mike Karmilowicz. Yes, within specialty, casualty segment, it includes mainly GL, the driver, umbrella, excess and commercial auto are the main factors that drive most of that business. And again, similar to the comments you made on the primary side, we're seeing a lot of the investment and so forth and just the rate and return in a lot of areas around that. As you've seen with the overall rate we've gotten in the last 3.5 years, we continue to see a lot of upside and opportunity across that, again, being very selective and very cautious about managing limits and how we approach the market. Juan Andrade : Just to build on that, I don't think there was any particular one-offs in the quarter for that particular line of business. I think it was a pretty stable execution across all of that. The other things that we think about to are some of the specialty lines, like trade credit and political risk, M&A transactional liability, we saw some pretty good growth in there as well across the portfolio. Michael Karmilowicz : I think the one key thing for us ultimately is having a really well balanced and diversified portfolio across multiple segments and multiple geographies. And given the market share opportunity of a $900 billion market and where we stand today, we see considerable upside, and we're in a position of strength. So we are very optimistic about opportunity. Operator : . Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Could you just talk a little bit on the IBNR provision for Ukraine, the assumptions that went into that, the type of range of outcomes around that? Is that a contemplation of a small number of potential claims or, I guess, a larger number of smaller ones? Just give us some feel for how that could potentially evolve. Juan Andrade : Yes, Ryan, this is Juan. Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit more color. I think as we've talked about really from the beginning of the year, there's a lot of uncertainty to this event, obviously, from the perspective that the war still ongoing. You really can't get claims adjusters on the ground. And we have gotten less than a handful of notices at this point in time. But these estimates are based on essentially ground-up assessment similar to frankly what we did during COVID, cedent by cedent to really try to understand the exposure by different lines of business. And it really does present sort of the best estimate that we have at this point for the lines that we articulated. But let me have Jim give you a bit more color on that. James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Ryan, it's Jim. And I think Juan hit on something very important, which is the comparison with the process we used during COVID, where we review each and every treaty that could be affected by what's happening in the Ukraine. We are in communication with our cedents, obviously, studying all other industry data as it becomes available. It's -- obviously, there's not a lot of information at this point, and there's a great deal of uncertainty. But for -- in particular, the marine line, the political violence line and trade credit. We had enough information to make what we thought was a good estimate around potential loss exposure and that's where we made our selection for the second quarter. Obviously, as Juan indicated, we only have a small number of actual submitted losses. Those are all advisory losses. They don't include actual loss numbers. And so we'll continue to monitor and make adjustments if it becomes necessary. Ryan Tunis : And then on the casualty, reinsurance side, casualty pro rata growth. Can you just help us understand, I guess, like the dynamic there? We had, I think, 4 quarters in a row where growth is above 50%, and now it's moderated some. What exactly was the story there? Did you add a bunch of new business last year and now it's just getting rate on that? Or -- yes, I'm just kind of trying to understand the dynamics there. James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Ryan. This is Jim again. The way I would describe it is, and it goes back to some comments that we've made a number of times around cedent selection. But that is one of the most fundamental aspects of how we conduct reinsurance underwriting is picking the right cedents to partner with, particularly when you're talking about a quota share structure. And so as the casualty market began to dislocate, pricing improved, terms and conditions were changing, et cetera. We worked with what our view are the best underwriters in the industry, and we took meaningful positions on their treaties. And so a lot of that unfolded in 2020 and certainly in 2021. And so as you achieve that, obviously, you now have a really, really strong position with an individual cedent, and you may choose to sustain that position versus necessarily increasing it year-over-year. And so some of the increase you'll get going forward on that particular cedent might be more in the form of just the growth of their own business, the growth of exposures, et cetera. So that is a major factor. However, even in addition to that, we continue to see some really nice opportunities in casualty on -- typically on a pro rata structure, and we're pursuing those opportunities, and we'll continue to do that. Juan Andrade : Brian, this is Juan. I would just jump in at the very end. If you look in the supplement, our growth in casualty pro rata has actually been quite good for the first half of this year. We're at about $1.2 billion compared to about $954 million last year about this time. And it's really what Jim has been articulating. Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you all for the questions and a great discussion today. I'm very optimistic about our future opportunity as evidenced by our growing global team, our consistent performance and track record. It's an exciting time to be at Everest. And as we continue to accelerate our strategic ambitions, we're creating more opportunity for our investors, clients and employees around the world. Thank you for your time and for your continued support of our company. Operator : Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the Everest Re Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matthew Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest's SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements, management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The current heightened and complex risk environment underscores the value of Everest's balance sheet and our commitment to support our customers with solutions vital to navigating this turbulent period. Everest's diversification strategy and underwriting discipline mitigated our exposure to one of the largest hurricane losses in U.S. history. With our well-defined strategy, we are poised to take advantage of the hardening market, focused on segments with the best risk-adjusted returns. Both underwriting businesses delivered sub-90 attritional combined ratios, and we are profitable on a year-to-date basis. Led by top talent, we continued to grow and diversify globally by business and product line. We are focused on executing our strategic plan as we build the company for the long term. Our purpose is to provide protection and stability in the face of uncertainty. And as someone with roots and family in Florida, the devastation caused by Ian is heartbreaking and our thoughts are with all those affected. I am grateful to our colleagues around the world who are supporting our customers and communities as they rebuild. We have improved the company's risk profile across both Reinsurance and Insurance, reducing our cat exposure with a more durable, resilient portfolio capable of absorbing a historic industry loss like Ian and containing it to an earnings event at just 1% of our estimated industry loss and with our Reinsurance segment being below 1%. We apply the same consistency and discipline to how we develop the overall portfolio, manage expenses, invest our capital and expand operational efficiencies. In short, we're managing what is in our control and building flexibility into the business. Everest value proposition has never been more important to our clients and partners, and we are committed as both insurers and reinsurers to being where we are needed. Now I'll turn to the company's financial results, first from the group and then for each of the underwriting businesses. In the third quarter, we grew gross written premiums by over 6% in constant dollars. Growth was broadly diversified, led by continued double-digit growth in Insurance. We continued to benefit from positive rate and increased exposure growth. We are ahead of loss trend, and that is before the effect of all the deliberate portfolio management actions we are taking to improve margin. The combined ratio for the group was 112%, including the previously announced pretax catastrophe losses net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums of $730 million, primarily from Hurricane Ian. It is important to note Everest has additional hedging protection in place in the form of cat bonds. We did not include a cat bond recovery in our net loss estimate. However, recovery start if the PCS industry event for Ian exceeds $48 billion. Mark will provide additional details. Again, the actions we took in both our businesses to reduce cat exposure have meaningfully benefited us. In Reinsurance, we significantly scaled back our retro, reduced participation in aggregate programs, shed cat exposed pro rata and exposure to lower layers of cat programs and achieved significant rate increases, higher attachment points and improved terms and conditions in the past several years. Reinsurance gross and net PMLs have reduced significantly across the entire curve. And in Insurance, we decreased gross PMLs for Southeast wind by over 40% since last year. Gross exposed limits in our U.S. property portfolio are down more than 35% year-over-year. Put this in concrete terms, our share of the industry loss for Ian is lower than any other major land falling hurricanes in more than 15 years. And we will continue to optimize our portfolio. Turning to our underlying performance in the third quarter. The group attritional combined ratio improved to 87.6% year-over-year with improvements in both segments and a new historic low for Insurance. The group attritional loss ratio was strong in the quarter at 60.2% with a 70 basis point improvement from last year. This includes an outstanding 110 basis point improvement year-over-year in Reinsurance. The group expense ratio in the quarter was stable at 5.5% and remains a competitive advantage. An elevated level of catastrophes during the third quarter resulted in a pretax underwriting loss of $367 million. Net investment income was $151 million, driven by stronger fixed income returns as new money yields continued to improve. As expected, this was partially offset by volatility in the equity markets. On a year-to-date basis, we generated net investment income of $620 million despite severe turbulence in all markets. Finally, operating cash flow for the quarter was strong at $1. 1 billion. We continued to execute our strategy despite the challenging environment, evidenced by our year-to-date profitability. Now turning to our Reinsurance business. Reinsurance gross written premiums increased 3.4% over last year on a constant dollar basis, excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums. Growth was broadly diversified, led by 16% growth in our global casualty and professional lines book, where we are focused on key seasons or achieving strong underlying profit improvement with pricing outpacing loss trend. This was offset by targeted reductions in our property book, which was down 8% over prior year as part of our strategy to improve the diversification and economics of our overall portfolio. We continued to benefit from a flight to quality, and we grew with our core clients. We're affording those new and expanded opportunities across their portfolios. This strategy serves us well. We bring clients a strong balance sheet, flexibility and expertise allowing us to target higher-margin opportunities in all lines of business and geographies. This is a key advantage of broad diversification. Fine ratio of 115% was driven by the previously announced pretax catastrophe loss net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums of $620 million from Hurricane Ian as well as the European hail storms Hurricane Fiona and Typhoon Nanmadol. Year-to-date, Reinsurance generated $14 million in underwriting profit. Our attritional combined ratio of 86.8 improved 30 basis points from the prior year, including a year-over-year attritional loss ratio improvement of 110 basis points to 59. 1%. Our attritional loss picks reflect our deliberate actions to improve the portfolio's risk-adjusted profitability. We continue to see improving loss ratios, while the pressure for increased commissions is easing. Everest is well positioned to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions in the market post Ian. Events from the year will affect the January 1 renewal in a variety of ways. In North America, we expect the property market to be dislocated, particularly in property cat due to recent losses, combined with economic inflation, increasing demand and a meaningful contraction of capacity. Underlying casualty pricing should remain strong. Internationally, there are nuances depending on class and region, and we will flex accordingly. We are well positioned with the balance sheet capabilities and relationships to capitalize on the momentum fueling improved economics across property and casualty in a targeted and disciplined manner. Because of the balance between property and casualty in our book, we have the ability to dynamically deploy capital both across line and geography and can remain nimble and opportunistic as market conditions warrant, always within our defined risk appetite framework. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q& A. Turning to our Insurance business. where we continue to achieve double-digit growth with sustained margin expansion. Growth in Insurance was strong. We achieved a new third quarter premium record for this segment with over $1.1 billion of gross written premium, up 13% in constant dollars.  Growth was broad and diversified across most lines and regions and was especially strong in U. S. casualty. Excluding D&O and transactional liability where the macro environment, a slowdown in M&A activity, IPOs, et cetera, has had an impact on deal flow, our growth was 20%. This is a testament to our underwriting discipline as we focus on trades meeting our underwriting return objectives. We are benefiting from additional premium on many inflation-sensitive lines, particularly in property, general liability and workers' compensation. We continue to exceed loss trends. Renewal rate and exposure ranged from high single digits to double digits for the quarter depending on line and geography, excluding workers' compensation, which is now a small part of our portfolio. In addition, both earned and new business rates meaningfully exceed renewal rate changes. The new business rate level bodes well for continued margin expansion as these policies renew and lost to more normalized levels in the future. Increasing rates are important, but risk selection, improving terms and conditions limits management and growth in inflation-sensitive exposures also contribute meaningfully to sustaining and increasing margins. Insurance growth was partially offset by continued actions to optimize the portfolio, including reductions in U.S. property catastrophe exposure. The impact of natural catastrophes, primarily Hurricane Ian, led to a $110 million pretax catastrophe loss net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums in the quarter and resulted in a combined ratio of 103.5%. As I mentioned earlier, underwriting actions to diversify our property portfolio made a significant difference in our results. We will continue to hold our portfolio to manage volatility. This discipline is reflected in our year-to-date underwriting profit of $95 million, and it is indicative of our progress in portfolio composition. The Insurance division's third quarter attritional combined ratio of 89.8% is the best in its history and a 50 basis point improvement from the third quarter last year. The attritional loss ratio for the quarter was 63. 2%, up slightly compared to Q3 2021, driven predominantly by business mix relative to last year. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio, which is less affected by timing and business mix, improved by almost a full point over last year. We continued to diversify internationally with progress in Europe, Latin America and Asia. We recently opened two new Everest Insurance operations in France and in Germany in addition to our operations in the Netherlands, Chile and Singapore. Our success continues to be powered by investments in great talent, and we continue to fuel our growth with sophisticated data, analytics and systems that support streamlined and best-in-class service across the organization. Michael Karmilowicz is on the call to provide more detail during the Q&A. Our discipline and seamless execution are essential to performing in today's environment. We are targeted in our approach. We're highly diversified by geography, business lines, product and in our people. We have a cultural advantage in how we manage the company. We view this as essential to cultivating excellence in our business, and we are proud to have been recently recognized as an industry leader in this area. I am very optimistic about Everest's ability to deliver superior value to our shareholders, clients and colleagues. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the financials in more detail. Mark? Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan mentioned, given the impact of Hurricane Ian, Everest reported an operating loss of $5.28 per diluted share in the third quarter. We remain profitable year-to-date with operating income of $14.91 per diluted share, which demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified businesses and the disciplined execution of our strategy. Net income stands at $101 million year-to-date, while total shareholder return, or TSR, was minus 1% year-to-date, given the cat losses as well as continued volatility in the equity markets. Despite those headwinds, we improved our attritional combined ratio in both segments again while generating disciplined growth as pricing and terms remained attractive in a number of our core lines of business. Based on the underlying performance of the business, our team continued to execute at a high level despite the cat and macro volatility, and we remain well positioned to take advantage of opportunities present in the current marketplace. Looking at the group results for the third quarter of 2022, Everest reported gross written premiums of $3.7 billion representing 6% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio of 112% for the quarter includes 27.4 points of losses from previously announced natural catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Ian as well as European hailstorms, Hurricane Fiona and several other cat events around the globe. While it is still early days following Hurricane Ian, our industry and company net cat loss estimates are $55 billion and $600 million, respectively. Everest also has up to $350 million of cat bond protection that will begin to attach starting at a $48 billion PCS industry loss threshold for Ian. This recovery would be recognized on a pro rata basis up to a $64 billion PCS industry loss level. PCS has currently estimated the loss at roughly $41 billion. This potential recovery is currently not included in our $600 million Ian loss estimate, but it does provide significant downside protection should the industry loss grow. I would also like to mention that our exposure in Florida, which is primarily homeowners based, mitigates our exposure to auto and flood losses. And that our participation to the NFIP is deminimis. Group attritional loss ratio was 60.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the Reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group's commission ratio improved 30 basis points to 20.9% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio was stable at 5.5%. Moving to the segment results. Starting with Reinsurance. The Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 3.4% to $2.6 billion in constant dollars. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by casualty pro rata as well as strategic growth in other international lines. Combined ratio of 115% includes 32.5 points related to natural catastrophes, largely attributable to Hurricane Ian. The attritional loss ratio improved 1.1 points to 59.1% as we continued to achieve more favorable rate and terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. Commission ratio was 23.9%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting expense ratio was 2.4% as earned premium gross and we remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire platform. Moving to Insurance, where we continue to build solid momentum. Gross written premiums grew 13.1% in constant dollars to $1.1 billion in the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 103.5% up modestly year-over-year due to the cat losses I mentioned earlier, but the attritional combined ratio improved 50 basis points to 89.8% for the quarter and 120 basis points year-to-date as rate and exposure continued to outpace trend, further supported by our focus on risk selection and favorable loss experience. The attritional loss ratio was slightly higher year-over-year due to mix of business. The commission ratio improved 1 point, largely driven by business mix and increased ceding commissions. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 14%, 10 basis points of reduction over the prior year, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet, net investment income for the quarter was $151 million. We are continuing to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio, while the lag in reporting for alternatives was a modest drag on results in the quarter. Overall, our reinvestment rate continues to trend higher as new money yields, which were roughly 4% just a few months ago were now north of 5% in today's market. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. Private equity investments yielded a negative $30 million P&L impact in Q3 as equity markets have declined in 2022. As a reminder, they are reported on a one quarter lag. For the third quarter of 2022, our operating income tax rate was approximately minus 22% due to the geographic mix of income and loss significantly impacted by the cat losses and thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $7.6 billion, driven primarily by the third quarter rise in interest rates. There was a corresponding negative $671 million impact on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities. Year-to-date, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $2. 2 billion. However, operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was very strong during the quarter, and it stands at $2.7 billion year-to-date. We also repurchased $58 million of our own stock during the quarter as well as approximately $6 million of subordinated debt. Book value per share ended the quarter at $195.27 per share while the book value, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $245.29 versus $252.2 per share at the end of 2021 due to the lower net income and foreign exchange headwinds of a stronger U.S. dollar. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 25.1%, an increase in the leverage ratio driven by the unrealized fixed income market value declines noted previously. In conclusion, Everest ended the third quarter of 2022 with favorable underlying results, notwithstanding the notable catastrophes. We have ample capital to take advantage of the current environment, and we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our third quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt to begin our Q&A. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you to please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up, and to join queue, if you have any additional questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : First question, Juan, is sitting around the dislocated property cat market. And I kind of want to get on to, I guess, both your willingness and ability to take part of that. You've been talking a lot about reducing volatility and kind of shy away from that business, but now things have changed. And I would ask on your willingness, how much do you want to grow in that business, but I think the answer is probably going to be what the function of how rates move at the beginning of the year. So maybe you could share with us, is there some kind of threshold you have in mind where you would like to participate pretty aggressively to be willing to grow in that property cap market? And then assume that you do want to, how much is your ability to do so inhibited by the markdowns in book value and AOCI impacts, especially with what we're seeing from S&P recently. Thanks. Juan Andrade : That's great, Mike. That's a pretty comprehensive question. So let me give you some thoughts on that, and then I'll invite some of my colleagues as well. Let me address the growth question first. And as I just said in my prepared remarks, we absolutely continue to see significant opportunities for growth in 2023. And Everest is very well positioned to achieve that growth given the market, as you just described it, also the strong client relationships and broker relationships that we have, relationships that have been built over decades. We also have the strength in the portfolio and we have expertise across lines and geographies that allow us to deploy capacity where we're seeing the best opportunities. So again, very bullish about the growth opportunities that we see going forward. In the property cat space, specifically to your question, the hardening that we're already seeing is going to intensify post Ian, and we've seen that in the discussions that we've been having initially in Monte Carlo, but certainly post CIAB and individual discussions that we've been having with our cedes. Our key priorities with regard to property cat are pretty straightforward. Number one is continue to harden our portfolio from a limits, structure, rate and term standpoint. Basically, continue the work that we've been doing now for the past several years. Number two is get paid significantly more for the risk that we're already taking. And number three, prudently grow with core cedes where we see the opportunity, where we see the alignment of entries, et cetera, all of this, however, within the trading range that we have outlined with respect to natural catastrophe exposure. Look, Mike, the bottom line is the market affords us tremendous opportunity right now and we will select the best options to maximize our returns and appropriately manage the volatility. So from a growth perspective, that's how we're looking at the market right now. I would invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more specifically about pricing and some of the other questions that you had as well. James Williamson : Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. It's Jim. Yes, I would reiterate some of what Juan said to start by just really conveying how tremendous we think this market opportunity is. And I think in the U.S., that is really a complete dislocation of the property cat market, and it's going to allow us to do a number of things. Juan describe the categories, let me give you a little bit more detail because I think it's critical. On the first part, in terms of hardening our portfolio, even while the market has been taking rate over the last couple of years, I think we've still been living, for the most part, with soft market terms, conditions and contracts. So that's a key priority. We're making progress on that front. I think you'll see us continue to trade away from some of the areas of the market, which really makes us susceptible to climate change, things like aggregate programs, cat exposed pro rata, some of the peak risks that comes along with the retro book. And then on the second piece, which is really about getting paid more, to put some context around that, I would say the expectation that the market had for pricing going into Monte Carlo in terms of average rate increase is now the minimum for programs that really haven't been affected by loss and it will go up from there. And while I expect clients to try to mitigate some of those rate increases by taking higher attachment points, which we're in favor of, my sense at this point is that rate change will be top line accretive for us even if we are making changes to the portfolio. And then the last piece around growth with target cedants, that's a very real opportunity for us. We're -- in front of us. We're already having discussions with our core trading partners around the world. There is an intense demand for capacity in general and Everest's capacity specifically, and we are being very thoughtful about picking up high-quality opportunities. So I think all of that nets up to a higher margin portfolio, a portfolio that's, I would guess, more likely to be bigger after 1/1 than it is today, but also one, as Juan indicated, that's well within the defined trading range that we set out in 2021. Juan Andrade : And maybe what I would add to that, Mike, is that at the end of all of this, we can see additional premium coming in because of this, but also reduced exposure overall, which for us is a terrific trade. Michael Phillips : Okay. It's pretty comprehensive. Second question then. You talked about the cap on recovery -- potential recovery, given where PCS might have. Are there other potential recoveries that might come that might be more likely for Ian relative to other prior hurricanes that you've experienced? I'm thinking maybe takes that you have more LAE versus loss mix this time that could come back if litigation doesn't take off or things like that. So other possible recoveries like that, that might happen more so for this storm than prior storms. Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, I think a couple of thoughts, and I think Mark Kociancic alluded to some of these in his statement. Look, the cat bond that would start attaching in excess of $48 billion I think it's a primary downside protection that is definitely worth keeping in mind and thinking about. As you know, PCS is the trigger for that. PCS right now is effectively at $40.9 billion, rounded up to $41 billion. And we could potentially foresee that loss growing to that trigger point at $48 billion. And as Mark mentioned, that would be a pro rata recovery up into the $60 billion range, and it would be significant downside protection. So I think that's one of the most important things to keep in mind. The other thing that I think Mark mentioned that's worth spending a little bit of time on is our exposure to Florida is particularly to the specialty carriers that focus on homeowners. So to the extent that this is more of an auto loss where it has a higher proportion of auto losses as we are seeing already in the market, that's essentially a good thing for us. The other thing that is a good thing for us is essentially a higher percentage of flood losses as we're also seeing in the market right now and also the fact that we don't really have a significant participation at all in the NFIP. So I think all of these things bode well for the estimate that we've put up there. The other part of it is we do have a good LAE load into our estimates as well, given the dynamics of the Florida environment as well. So from that perspective, we continue to see this as being a prudent estimate that we have out there right now. But let me ask my colleagues and see if they would add anything to that answer as well. James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Mike, it's Jim Williamson again. Just to add a little bit of flavor to what Juan has already described. On LAE loading in particular, I think we've obviously leveraged a lot of the data we have to come up with a loading for LAE that we think is extremely prudent. And so if there is better-than-expected activity on that front, which I think is possible, that would definitely enure to our benefit. The other thing I would sort of say to put this in some concrete terms, I mean I think our view would be if the loss ends up being smaller than we've indicated in terms of total industry loss, our view is that our share would remain relatively stable over a reasonable range. So that means our net loss would ultimately come in smaller. And then to Juan's earlier point, there's also upside protection in the form of cap bonds if PCS calls an industry loss that ends up being larger, which sort of caps our upside dollar value of net loss. So I think it puts us in a really confident position relative to the net loss that we had indicated. Michael Karmilowicz : And this is Mike Karmilowicz. I would just add on the Insurance division side, we certainly benefit from third-party reinsurance as well. We do obviously have different structures, but not to get into details, but we do have quota share per risk and other kind of extra wells that we'll be able to get some benefit from as well. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. So my first question, I guess, picking up on the Reinsurance side. So it sounds like, right, you guys will try to manage any increase within your risk tolerances. But you could write more business, I think you said with the existing clients. So as you see the market evolving next year, how do you envision that coming together in both your cat load and your P&L? Would they be higher? Or how do you envision managing those next year? James Williamson : Yes, Elyse, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, first of all, to reiterate some of what I said earlier. I mean, I think this is a fantastic market opportunity. And what that translates into is an ability for us to really set terms and conditions in a way that are obviously going to be highly favorable. And I think that'll include an ability for us to manage our total exposures, Juan had indicated while still driving higher revenue.  And more importantly, much better margins, much better contracts, terms, conditions, attachment points, etc. And so I would say, my sense is we're not going to have to stretch our total risk load, whether you measure it in PML, or the cat load, in order to drive the types of outcomes we're describing, which again, could include some really nice growth, as well as margin expansion. Juan Andrade : And I think -- this is Juan, Elyse, and again thanks for the question. Again, our goal is to expand risk adjusted returns, right. It's really to expand our margin. And that's really the significant opportunity that we see in front of us. And as I just said to Mike a few seconds ago, the reality is, with the current pricing, the current terms, we think we can grow the top line without necessarily growing the exposure. And our strategy to continue to manage volatility for the long term, to diversify the company is still very much in place. But we do have the nuances of this market, which will allow us to make those trades where we think we can expand margins, and we can continue to grow, given the conditions in place right now. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, you guys pointed out mix impacting the insurance underlying loss ratio. How should we think about the underlying loss ratio trending from here as you're getting price above trend, and we're also thinking about mix shift. Would you expect improvement in that number? I'm not just talking about the Q4. I'm also thinking about 2023 as well. Juan Andrade : Yeah, no, thank you, Elyse. And look at what I would guide you to is what I said in my prepared remarks. And this is Juan. We just look at the year to date attritional loss ratio for the insurance division. And that's basically 80 basis points better than the prior year. And the way we get there is through a lot of the levers that I've talked about in the past, right. It's the cycle management. It's the diversity of our -- of our business. We're able to move pretty nimbly to lines that have better risk adjusted returns, better profitability, et cetera, et cetera.  Our commitment is to continue to improve that profitability and the margin within the insurance division. And I think, as I said, in prior calls, you go back to the end of 2019, where that was running around the 96. Now you're running sub-90, on the attritional combined ratio for the division. And that's what you should expect. I mean, that's the commitment. And that's where we're driving this to going forward. But I would invite Mike Karmilowicz to maybe to add to that. Michael Karmilowicz : Yeah, I would just add a couple things. One, this is a long term game. We continue to focus on this business that drives the right margins. And the other piece too, is we focus heavily on the combined ratio as well. So it's the entire package. And yes, you've seen over the last from a rolling perspective in the last 24 months, we've actually brought our combined ratio down 24 point -- I'm sorry, 5 points alone. So our goal is to continue to drive the ultimate loss ratio, and the overall results of the organization. Exactly what Juan said. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. A couple questions here. Just first I'm just curious, how does Mt Logan going to fare in this event? And I'm just curious on that topic, how does that kind of interplay with Everest's willingness to write kind of gross cat exposure in the marketplace? James Williamson : Sure, Brian, this is Jim Williamson. And a couple of things. Mt Logan is structured, essentially, on a quota share basis. And so the results that Everest generates for its own balance sheet are the same results that our Mt Logan investors experience, which is I think, a differentiator for us because it creates an incredible alignment of interests. And it means in situations where we have a large loss events, the investors in Mt Logan are getting the exact experience that we're having on our site.  So it'll be very consistent that way. One thing that I would mention, obviously, any given quarter and the third quarter in particular, can have elevated cat losses. You really need to look at it over time. And I would say, on a year-to-date basis, while we have had significant cat activity this year, we've also collected a great deal of cat premium, and that is to the benefit of our Mt Logan investors.  And so I think, I don't think there'll be any surprises in that for them. And then, just a little comment on the external environment around ILS and fundraising. We have a very robust pipeline of ILS investment opportunities. I think there's a lot of interest in the offering that we have in Mt Logan, and in particular, based on the factor that I just mentioned around alignment of interests, it is a more challenging environment to raise ILS capital, just because people are getting at a rethink. But that's what's driving a lot of the hardening and the dislocation we've seen in the market. I think the good news is, from our perspective, we think about gross lines management. Really is an independent factor. And so whether we raise, X or Y amount of money in Logan is not going to affect how we think about our gross line underwriting. We're really looking to drive gross profits. That translates into net profit for our balance sheet as well as good results for our Logan investors. And we're going to continue that approach. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then Juan, I'm just curious, you may have kind of alluded this to your comments. But what are your thoughts on the casualty reinsurance market here? Are these events going to have a favorable impact on pricing? And in terms of conditions in the casualty reinsurance market, and it sounds like you're well-positioned to take advantage of that, if that's the case? Juan Andrade : Yeah, Brian, I would agree with you. Look, I think number one, I think we are very well positioned for frankly, the reasons that I stated earlier, right? We're well diversified. We have the clients and the broker relationships. We have the balance sheet. And so from that perspective, we feel very good about where we are. And you saw it in the numbers that we quoted this morning, right? So global casualty book, and reinsurance grew by 16% in the quarter. And the reason for that is because we do see the opportunity continuing, right?  We do expect primary rates to keep up with trends in 2023 in the casualty lines. We expect reinsurance terms and conditions to be stable to improving. And that will allow us to continue to deploy additional capacity into the space.  And look, when you think about the macro factors that are impacting that, there's a lot of risk in the environment, right. So if you think about social inflation in the U.S., if you think about economic inflation around the world, companies are being very disciplined, right. And so from that perspective, we do expect that pricing, terms and conditions to remain favorable throughout 2023. I think that's, again, a great opportunity for us to continue executing on our strategy, which is diversifying the book. If you look at our numbers in the supplement now, our reinsurance division is basically now split 50-50 between property and casualty. And that's important, because we're not a one trick pony, right? We have levers to pull, and we're pulling them. But let me invite Jim to also maybe deepen that answer. James Williamson : Sure. Thanks, Juan. Yeah, Brian, I think what our expectation is, and what we're starting to see, even in the 11/1renewals, for example, it's relatively light, but we are seeing some indications is that we've really started to see the leveling of ceding commissions play itself out, we expected that to begin to occur. That is in fact occurring. In fact, we're starting to see some examples of ceding commission's receding a little bit, which we think is quite healthy. And I do think to a degree that's tied to what's happening in the property cap market. And when we engage our cedants, you know, we really try to come up with constructive solutions across lines for those customers.  And in many cases they're absolutely willing to discuss ceding commission reduction on core casualty programs, in some cases related to an increase in available cat capacity or a restructuring of another program. And so all the cards are on the table that way. And I do think that, combined with the ongoing strength in the underlying market that Juan talked about, means that casualty will be a great opportunity for us in 2023. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : Yeah, thank you. I wanted to hear a little bit about your outwards reinsurance purchasing. What might happen to that next year, to the extent to which you're reliant on the ILS markets and as the next few years go by, and perhaps investors in those markets pull capital out? What it means for the degree to which you protect yourself in retro and reinsurance line? Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh. This is Juan. Let me let me start that and then I'll ask Mike Karmilowicz to talk more about the cedant reprogram within the insurance division. Look, I think as we've talked about in the past, we are not dependent on retro, on the ILS market, et cetera, to deploy capacity. And I think that is one of the significant advantages that we have here at Everest where we have a capital shield. We have the balance sheet to be able to do what we need to do. Some of our peer competitors are not in that situation. And it's going to be a very difficult renewal in some ways to January 1, because they're also still in the point of trying to line up the retro and the capacity, so they know how much they can deploy. We are not in that situation.  And so we're actively working in the market to be able to deploy capacity, according to the strategy that that we outlined a few minutes ago. But let me ask Mike to jump in and talk a little bit about the cedant reprogram that we employ within the insurance division. Michael Karmilowicz : Yeah. Thanks, Juan. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I think specific to the reinsurance business, the reality is just like Juan said, we're not relying on third party coverage, even though we do purchase and manage our portfolio that way. It doesn't help it or doesn't -- is not necessary for us to execute our business plan. So we see that market having impact and I think we'll see some things -- I don't think it'll be material. But for us, having the wherewithal, the financial strength of Everest, and having all the different scale that we've created over the last couple of years gives us the availability to be able to execute our plans, with not being reliant on it. I do will tell you, I do think it'll have impact and behavior on a lot of peers who are relying on reinsurance. Josh Shanker : Thank you. And just a question on the investment portfolio? Is there any arbitrage opportunity for you to crystallize and recognize investment losses in order to have the opportunity to redeploy to higher yield? Or is it just a matter of taking expiring bonds and redeploying them at the current opportunity? Mark Kociancic : Josh, it's Mark. So we have that opportunity set. But we do have a few other considerations in that kind of decision tree. So one, you've got the strength of the operating cash flow coming in and the maturing portfolio. So that's feeding quite a bit of cash into the current reinvestment structure that we have in money yields.  The second point is, where are we with rates in general, I think the FOMC caught the market off guard in late September with their rate rise. And you have a question here is, are they done? We've seen them kind of undershoot throughout the year. And so it's also a question of when you go in. Having said that, I would say that we are looking to lengthen duration a bit on the fixed income side. And we do have the significant allocation to floating rate securities, the '22 points which rises in that environment. So I think we're quite comfortable with both the pace and the direction that we're moving in. But your first option is definitely something that's on the table if we want it. Josh Shanker : Thanks for the answers. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Zelensky from BMO. Please go ahead. Michael Zelensky : Hey, good morning. Follow up to the last question on the investment portfolio. I'm curious, what's the duration of the floating rate portfolio or maybe the yield to that we should think about in the floating rate portfolio. Juan Andrade : Well, the duration is de minimis. You're dealing with a 0.1, 0.2 type of effective duration calculation on it. The yield itself on a standalone basis is quite attractive, just depending on the type of CLO we're dealing with. So it's pretty much an investment grade portfolio. The triple As, the triple Bs, you're going to get different series of yields between them. So you can get anything from six handles to even upwards of a nine on depending on the type of credit quality that's being discussed. Michael Zelensky : Okay, interesting. Thank you. Moving to outside the investment portfolio, clear in the commentary that you feel rates are in excess of loss trends, which bodes well for margins. You know, I heard your commentary on ceding commissions from the reinsurance side. Kind of just curious, have rates and maybe I just need to read that -- reread the transcript. There's a lot of good stuff in the prepared remarks, have rates on the primary side decelerated a bit 3Q versus kind of the first half of the year or are they holding kind of that. Juan Andrade : Mike, this is Juan. No, they're actually quite steady and frankly, in some lines, they've actually improved. And so we have not seen a deceleration in the third quarter over the second quarter. Michael Zelensky : Okay, okay. Interesting. And just, it sounds like you guys don't want to quantify what the dollar amount of recoveries would be between like the $48.9 billion if it hits it, versus your $55 billion peg on the industry losses? Is my thinking about that correctly? Will it just be significant? Juan Andrade : No, no, during my prepared remarks, Mike, I was making the point that we have a $350 million limit on our cat bond between industry loss of $48.9 billion and approximately $64 billion. It's really a pro rata recovery, depending on where PCS ultimately sets their industry loss peg, right. So currently, they are below that $40.9 billion, if I recall correctly. So there is downside protection. And obviously, our loss pick for the industry is at a $55 billion. So you'd have full recovery in essence with, maybe some basis risk between our pegs and whatever the cap on is coming out with. That gives you a sense of how it could develop. Michael Zelensky : Okay, understood. Thank you for the color. Juan Andrade : Thanks Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you. A couple of I think quick questions. First, in the context of Matt Logan or ILS investors, are there new investors that are now looking at the asset classes that you're either speaking with or observing? Mark Kociancic : Hey, it's Mark Meyer. So there's definitely, I think a lot of emphasis on sophisticated investors who have been in the asset space for quite some time. We have, I would say, a pretty good pipeline, a high degree of interest, particularly given the opportunities they have with Everest. The fact that we have such a strong alignment with the underwriting of our cat book in reinsurance division. So from that standpoint, like I said, nice pipeline and sophisticated investors and lots of money to deploy.  Tactically, at different layers, and we're fortunate that we can meet those different types of appetite, because of our scale. Meyer Shields : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. And then just a small question in terms of operations when you've got an event like Hurricane Ian, how should we think about the impact on the acquisition expense ratio related to just big cat losses? James Williamson : Yeah, Meyer, it's Jim Williamson, I think you might be referring to, primarily on the reinsurance side, in terms of what our condition ratio would be in a quarter where we have a significant cat event and reinstatement premiums. And look reinstatement premiums do come with acquisition costs. They tend to be significantly lower than our average. And so on balance they would tend to bring down the average acquisition cost of the division. So I think that's the question you're asking, if it's not, though, please let me know. Meyer Shields : Yeah, no, that's helpful. I was actually asking about incentive compensation and whether it is a change to year-to-date numbers because of the loss. James Williamson : Pardon me. Meyer, say it one more time. Meyer Shields : I was asking you about whether any of the incentive costs have been accrued in the first half of the year or reversed when you've got a single large loss? James Williamson : Yeah, okay. I see your point, Meyer. On a reinsurance basis. I think that's a relatively minor issue. And so that would not be the factor transcribing. And so there's that component. I would say, I don't know, Mike, if there's anything that you would add on the insurance side. Michael Karmilowicz : I don't have anything to add on the insurance side. James Williamson : Yeah, I think it's a relatively minor thing. Meyer Shields : Perfect, thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. I want to circle back to the cat load. And clearly we're seeing an improvement in the cat load and an improvement in the market share. No doubt about that. At the same time, I think if we look at year-to-date cat losses. And extrapolate into fourth quarter we are getting to about 10% cat load range for the year. And that's awful. I think a relatively normal industry cat last year of call it, $100 billion $110 billion.  And that just -- I think it's still coming up a little bit ahead of what you had guided to for the year. So I was hoping to get a better understanding of that delta. And I appreciate the fact that you haven't captured any of the cap on recoveries on Ian yet, but I would think that those only start recovering if the loss really starts spiking to the point that we are well above an annualized -- normalized cat load. James Williamson : Sure, Yaron, it's Williamson. Thanks for the question. It's going to, I think, take a couple of key points to unpack the question, because it's an important one. And I'll start with a little bit of a description on how we arrived at the 6% to give you some perspective on that. And so we leveraged both external cat modeling capabilities is the same ones that are used across the industry, as well as our own internal analytics to perform a ground up assessment of our in-force portfolio, which gives us an average view over an extended period of time of what we expect our net cat losses to look like.  So it's important to remember, it's an average. And in any given year, obviously, actual results will vary from that average. In terms of the alignment of that load to total industry losses, or the idea that we're in a period where industry losses are going to range, whether it's -- you think it's $100 billion or $120 billion a year, how does that comport to our cat load? It's very consistent. Our view is that that is a relatively normal year. But what you have to keep in mind is what events make up the $100 billion or $120 billion, is incredibly important.  And I'll share some specific examples just from this third quarter. We're tracking around the world 74 events that occurred during the quarter that are considered cat by the industry. Only three of them resulted in losses to at-risk for the quarter. And we've talked about those. And so what that means is that there are a lot of events that occur in the industry that will drive loss for primary insurers, or some reinsurers that don't result in losses to at-risk. And that's because we have a -- we have a definition of a cat. It has to be over $10 million involving multiple seasons.  Obviously, our book, in various parts of the world is structured to avoid more attritional type of cat losses. So that gives you a sense of that. And in a year, where you have a cat or nearly Cat 5, Florida landfall hurricane, that's obviously going to be much more of a reinsurance event, and drive more loss into the reinsurance market, which is what's resulting in our cat, actual cat loss being in excess of our cat load. So hopefully, that allows you to square the circle. And there's no question that there you could have a year with $120 billion of cat losses, where our cat load is less than 6%. It really is that dependent on what events are driving it. And then the last piece, as you do mention, we're not including any cap on recovery in our estimate of net losses. And my view would be if PCS continues to develop upward, and those trigger our cat loss, remember, we called in at $55 billion. So my gross loss wouldn't move just because PCS gets to $49 billion, which gives us I think, a good degree of prudence. And then again, above our 55 level, I think that's when the cat recovery really holds our dollar value net losses at the level that we've indicated. So we feel very good about that number, and there's a lot of prudence built into it. Yaron Kinar : Great, that's very reassuring. Thank you. My second question, it's amazing what a difference a quarter makes. I think last quarter, I asked about the 8% to 12% CAGR and reinsurance carrier target and reinsurance for three years may be coming in a little bit below that expectation. You know, again, a quarter makes a big difference. Just given the different market dynamics, do you think that, that 8% to 12% CAGR maybe on the low end now? James Williamson : Yeah, Yaron, it's Jim again. I mean, I think the first thing, I would just remind everybody out that, that was an assumption that we made, that was built into our strategy for getting to a total shareholder return. We have a lot of levers to drive those returns outside of reinsurance growth rate. So that would be one key point. The next is we have driven significant growth. If you think about when we made that call, we were really beginning at the -- launching off point was the end of 2020. So we have driven, very significant growth.  It was very front loaded, because we saw that market opportunity, particularly in casualty. So that's very relevant. But to your broader point is do I believe that our prospects for growth in 2023 are greater now than I would have believed the last time we talked about it? Absolutely. I think the market opportunity that we all know is in front of us, will give us the opportunity to drive more top line at better margins, probably with less total exposure on the property side. And then as Juan and others as indicated on the casualty side we think there's a renewed opportunity to continue our growth rate.  In the specialty lines, there's a tremendous amount of dislocation that's occurred, due to the war in the Ukraine and other factors. We think that will present some very interesting opportunities. And then we continue to invest in our business, which gives us new capabilities to deliver value to our customers, drive top line growth. So I think, yeah, a quarter does make a huge difference on that front. Mark Kociancic : And Yaron, the last thing I would say, and I've said it before, it's all about risk adjusted return, and expanding margins and profitability. And we see the opportunity to be able to do both. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much, and best of luck. Mark Kociancic : Thanks, Yaron. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Yeah, I guess first question, can you just give us an idea of -- on the reinsurance side from Ian, the complexion and the loss between domestic Florida carriers, national carriers, and how concentrated is it in individual programs? James Williamson : Yeah, sure, Ryan, it's Jim Williamson. The first thing to indicate, just when we think about our view of the industry loss, we do think this is primarily going to be a residential driven loss, with obviously a very large component of home. But probably a bit of an outsized auto loss as well. For our particular portfolio, we will definitely be concentrated in the Florida specialist. For the most part, this is a general comment, but for the most part, our large national clients won't see significant attachment in their programs. Obviously there'll be some loss, but not that significant. They manage their exposure in Florida very carefully. So there is that factor. And as Mark had indicated, in his comments, I think that's actually quite a good thing for us. Because potential creep around the loss related to things like auto, for example, or commercial flooding, are not going to be a factor for us. So if that -- if those two factors were to drive uplift in the ultimate industry loss, that really shouldn't have an impact on our net loss. So I think I think about that as a very good thing. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then just a follow up I guess, kind of a risk management standpoint, if I look at the 10 Q, it would predict a southeast wind loss of this size, somewhere between one every 101 -- every 250 years. Obviously Ian is not that rare. So is there any thinking internally about maybe dusting off these models or just putting a little bit more weight toward common sense? James Williamson : Yeah, Ryan's well one, just with respect to where you ended that question, we use the models for a number of things. But underwriting judgment, expertise, and a whole lot of common sense go into how we manage risk, how we set our risk thresholds, how we price our business, how we decide whether or not to participate in programs, etc. But in terms of your point, look, I think what Ian shows, if you look at our current loss estimate, and $55 billion, and our net P&L statistics, it's showing more like a 1 in 41 than 50. Which I don't think the return period on a storm like this is that remote. I think it's more like a 1 in 20 loss range. And the delta between those two figures is really our prudence around the cap on recovery, because again, we're publishing that PML.  Our expectation, you know, as Mark has indicated, to give you that number is if PCS catches up to our view of the ultimate industry loss, there's going to be a meaningful cap on recovery, which would lower our net loss, which would square with our P&L our published P&L. So that's why you're seeing a little bit of a headache. It's not anywhere near 1 in 100. Ryan Tunis : Got it. I mean the 10-Q says this was 1 in 20, the loss should have been, the net loss should have been half what it was. James Williamson : And to Mark's point, right, we have $350 million of cap on limit that will begin attaching just under $49 billion of PCS event and will exhaust just around $64 million. So that is a meaningful number. And my view would be, remember, we've tagged industry loss at 55. So if PCS begins to catch up to us and development in their numbers is not unprecedented, they can travel upward a long way without having any impact on our view of our gross loss. But we would begin to recover, lowering our net loss. And so I think it tracks to my view of what a 1 in 20-ish type of event would look like. Ryan Tunis : Thanks, Jim. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Thank you for your questions and a great discussion today. I think as you can hear from this management team, we are very bullish about the future and the opportunity for all of our stakeholders. The passion, the innovation from our team is palpable in every facet of this business. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of our company. WE look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Re Group, Ltd. fourth quarter of 2022 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements, management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest's excellent fourth quarter performance capped another strong year of consistent execution of our strategy and continued positive momentum. We advanced our objective of creating sustainable value for our shareholders with disciplined underwriting and targeted growth driving margin expansion in both businesses. We increased diversification in each of our segments both geographically and by product line. When you combine all of this with healthy and consistent rate increases and improved terms, our risk adjusted return profile improved across the Board. Both franchises delivered solid top and bottom line performance. We profitably grew our primary insurance division and executed an outstanding January 1 reinsurance renewal. This further reinforced our global market leadership and positions Everest well for the future. Our actions resulted in solid underwriting profit for the year, over $1 billion in operating income and a double-digit operating return on equity for both the quarter and the year, an excellent result. We achieved these results despite market volatility, economic and geopolitical uncertainty and industry catastrophe losses totaling over $140 billion in the fifth costliest CAT year in history. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2022 and built a wide runway for future opportunity. We are uniquely positioned with accelerating momentum and top tier talent driving this business. Everest is more agile and well-equipped than ever and we have the ability and the drive to seize attractive opportunities and deliver on our commitments in 2023. Now, I will briefly recap our financial highlights focused on the full year beginning at the Group level. In 2022, we grew the company by 9% in constant dollars ending the year at approximately $14 billion in gross written premium. We generated $477 million in underwriting profit with a 96 combined ratio. This is a near 2 points improvement year-over-year despite an active CAT year. The attritional combined ratio of 87.4% also improved from the end of 2021 and we achieved a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in the group loss ratio. The operating expense ratio remains best-in-class at 5.8%. Finally, our high quality investment portfolio generated $830 million in net investment income. Our actions to optimize the investment portfolio over the past three years and position it for a rising rate environment have paid significant dividends. Now turning to our underwriting segments, beginning with reinsurance. Our reinsurance division's focused execution in 2022 further enhanced our global market leadership and preferred partner position. We continue to optimize our portfolio while achieving solid top and bottom-line growth. For the full year, reinsurance growth was 5% on a constant dollar basis with $9.3 billion in total gross written premiums. This growth was driven by broadened opportunities with our core cedents and our nimble allocation of capital to achieve the highest returns. We took deliberate actions during 2022 to shed underperforming business. This also positioned us well to take advantage of the strong trading conditions at January 1. These actions resulted in over $300 million in underwriting profit for the year and a combined ratio of 96.4%, there's a 1.7 point improvement from '21. For the full year, both the attritional loss ratio at 58.7% and the attritional combined ratio at 86.2% improved down 90 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. Our deliberate underwriting actions significantly reduced our CAT losses, demonstrated by our less than 1% market share from Hurricane Ian in the third quarter, the second largest hurricane in U.S. history. Our focused Reinsurance strategy continues to pay dividends. Throughout 2022, we leveraged our market position, deep client and broker relationships and strong balance sheet to building more profitable and higher margin book, which culminated in an outstanding January 1 renewal. I'll provide more color on 1/1 in a few minutes. Now turning to our primary insurance division. In 2022, we've made tremendous strides expanding our reach, capabilities, product set and breadth of global talent while hitting important financial milestones. We finished the year with insurance growth of 18% in constant dollars and $4.6 billion in premiums. This is supported by new quarterly gross written premium record in the fourth quarter. Growth was balanced and diversified across the business by product line and by geography. After four years of significant and cumulative rate increases, we achieved high-single digit average increases excluding workers' compensation throughout the year. In addition to rate, exposure growth driven by revenue and payroll increases created additional margin against loss trend, pricing increases in the quarter were led by commercial auto, general liability and property. Our proactive cycle management actions contributed to our continued improved underwriting profitability, our ability to pivot quickly is a key advantage. Everest continues to benefit from an influx of top talent with the market expertise, track-record, underwriting acumen and relationships to execute our strategy. We achieved the milestone full year underwriting profit of $164 million, which is a new annual record for the Insurance Division with a full year combined ratio of 94.8%, down 2.3 points year-over-year. Our attritional combined ratio also improved 80 basis points year-over-year to 90.4%. We are enhancing our operations to become even more connected and efficient on a global scale. It's an exciting time for our primary business. We continue to see significant opportunities and I look forward to even greater momentum ahead. 2022 was a year of multiple wins, we've reduced volatility, diversified the portfolio, expanded margins and enhanced our risk adjusted return. We got there with consistent and precise execution. We deployed our capital in areas where we could get the best risk-adjusted returns. We also reshaped our property portfolio through continued diversification via growth internationally. All this accomplished while increasing our top and bottom-lines and we improved net exposure to our balance sheet. As I mentioned before, we remain risk-on for property CAT as pricing, terms and conditions provide attractive returns within our defined trading range. Turning to 2023, the January 1 reinsurance renewals were executed by our global reinsurance team with equal precision, and as a result, we have a significantly stronger portfolio heading into 2023 and beyond. We approached the January 1 renewals from a position of strength. With a superior value proposition, well-prepared to support our clients and taking advantage of excellent market conditions around the world. We set clear goals for our portfolio and we achieved every one of them by leveraging Everest global market leadership and setting early expectations with clients and brokers which drove significant pricing improvements. In addition to rate, we also substantially improved terms and conditions. We targeted attractive property opportunities both domestically and internationally at materially improved risk-adjusted returns. We drove higher attachment points and reduced exposure to named and secondary payrolls. Significant property CAT rate increases were evident across all geographies. In North America, the property CAT XOL risk-adjusted rate change was up approximately 50%. The average attachment point for our global property CAT business also increased meaningfully, resulting in significantly reduced risk exposure. At the same time, the expected return for our CAT portfolio increased materially. In casualty and professional lines pricing and terms and conditions continue to improve overall. And we leveraged our property market to strengthen and further diversify the portfolio. Internationally, the 1/1 renewal exceeded our expectations throughout Europe and Asia. We grew our regional portfolios through increased participations and by expanding our base of new clients. We also saw significant rate movement in specialty lines exposed to the Russia, Ukraine war particularly in marine, aviation and political violence. I am very pleased with the performance of our outstanding reinsurance team. Everest distinguished itself in this renewal by our early and consistent communication with our brokers and clients. We set expectations heading into 1/1 and constructively work with them to find solutions. As a result, we improved our portfolio and expanded margins while deepening our relationships with brokers and clients. Looking forward to future 2023 renewals, we expect reinsurance pricing momentum to continue. We see abundant opportunity to continue growing and diversifying our portfolio in all markets, focused on further growth in Asia and Europe, while capitalizing on the continuing market dislocation in property. Given significant firming of the reinsurance market on January 1 and the heightened risk environment, primary insurers should also see firming prices in 2023, and they will need to maintain underwriting discipline. I am proud of what Everest achieved in '22. We delivered on our strategic objectives, while laying the groundwork for sustained profitable growth. I attribute Everest success to our outstanding team under consistent and relentless execution in every aspect of the business. The outlook for 2023 is bright, and I look forward to taking this company to the next level. Now I will turn the call over to Mark to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Good morning, everyone. Everest finished off 2022 with very strong results across the board in the fourth quarter. Operating income was $478 million or $12.21 per diluted share for the quarter, equating to an operating ROE of 19.4%. For the full year, operating income was approximately $1.1 billion or $27.08 per diluted share, with an operating ROE of 10.6%, while the annualized TSR or total shareholder return was 5.4%. Juan highlighted, we have a number of strengths in both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, bolstered by our team's consistent execution around the globe. We remain very well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities ahead. Looking at the Group results for the fourth quarter, Everest reported gross written premiums of $3.7 billion, representing 9% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio of 87.8% for the quarter represents 4.1 points of improvement over the prior year's quarter, driven by lower CAT losses as well as a continued improvement in attritional loss experience primarily in reinsurance. Group current year loss ratio was 59.6%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. Group's commission ratio was 21.6%, up modestly on mix changes, while the Group expense ratio was modestly higher year-over-year at 6%. Moving to the segment results, and starting with Reinsurance. In the fourth quarter, the Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 3.7% to $2.4 billion in constant dollars. The growth was driven primarily by property pro rata business. Combined ratio was strong at 86.4%, an improvement of 5.1 points year-over-year primarily on lower CAT losses. Current year loss ratio improved 1.5 points to 58.2%, as we continue to achieve favorable rate and terms, optimize mix and scale various lines as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. The commission ratio was 25%, up modestly, largely driven by mix and the underwriting expense ratio was 2.8%, broadly in line with the prior year's quarter. Moving to insurance, where we continue to build solid momentum. Gross premiums written grew 20.5% in constant dollars to nearly $1.3 billion in the quarter. As Juan mentioned, a record level of production in the fourth quarter for the division. Combined ratio for the quarter was 91.4%, a 1.4 point improvement from a year ago. The current year loss ratio was 63.4% in the quarter, slightly higher year-over-year due to mix and a onetime adjustment relating to our Lloyd's Syndicate. Commission ratio improved 1 point, largely driven by business mix. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 15%, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our franchise and invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. And finally to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet. Net investment income for the quarter was $210 million versus $205 million a year ago, as we continue to benefit from higher new money yields, an increasing resets in our floating rate securities within the fixed income portfolio. Private equity investments yielded a negative $30 million P&L impact in Q4, and they are reported on a one quarter lag. Overall, our reinvestment rate continues to trend higher year-over-year, as new money yields remain in the 5% range, while the book yield was 3.5% at the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. And as a reminder, that 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. Fourth quarter, our operating income tax rate was approximately 11%, within our assumed range of 11% to 12% over the course of the year. And regarding the balance sheet, we completed the last of our granular reserve reviews across our entire portfolio, which affirm the overall strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our disciplined underwriting and prudent reserving philosophies. Overall, our reserve adequacy remains solid. We did strengthen our asbestos and environmental reserves, which makes up approximately 1% of total net reserves by $138 million to position that runoff book comfortably within the average range for industry survival ratios. This was offset by favorable development from a variety of areas, primarily from short-tail lines. We also had other marginal adjustments in both segments, resulting in 0 net prior year development. We continue to remain prudent given the uncertainty of inflation and the heightened risk environment the entire P&C industry currently faces. In short, we remain confident in the strength of our reserve position. Moving to shareholders' equity, ended the quarter at $8.4 billion, driven primarily by the strong earnings in the quarter as well as a modest recovery on the value of available-for-sale fixed income securities as rates moderated slightly. Net unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio as of December 31 were approximately $1.7 billion down from a net unrealized loss of $2 billion at the end of the third quarter 2022. Operating cash flow was strong at over $1 billion during the quarter and it stands at $3.7 billion year-to-date. Book value per share ended the quarter at $215.54 per share, while the book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities, stood at $259.18 versus $252.12 per share at the end of 2021, driven by the strong underwriting results mentioned earlier. Long-term debt to total capital at quarter end stood at 23.3%, broadly similar to the level last quarter. In conclusion, Everest ended 2022 with a very strong fourth quarter. We have the platform, balance sheet and the team to continue to take advantage of the current environment, and we have a lot of momentum as we look ahead into 2023. That summarizes our fourth quarter results. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt to begin our Q&A session. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Operator :  And our first question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, if I may. The first one, just listening to your commentary on 1/1 renewals and expectations that the reinsurance market remains hard, at least into midyear. I guess as I look at the PMLs that we saw in -- for 1/1, they still seem to be down quite a bit relative to mid '22 levels. Is that the right comparison or should we think about kind of what the PML will look like in midyear '23 relative to midyear '22? And could you give us some maybe thoughts on how we should see those develop? James Williamson : Yes, Yaron. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Maybe to set a little bit of the stage, I'd like to add some color around 1/1 to add to the comments that you heard from Juan and Mark because I think it's an important context when we're talking about PMLs. And to reiterate what Juan said, it was simply an outstanding renewal. We executed with incredible precision and achieved a number of important objectives in the renewal that really resulted in a step change in the risk-reward equation for Everest. As you heard, we received significant rate increases in our U.S. property CAT business on the order of 50%. We essentially improved every metric that we use to measure our CAT portfolio. Our average attachment points were up. Our attachment probabilities were down. Despite all of that, rate online increased. Our expected combined ratio dropped materially. Our expected ROE increase materially. Our expected loss in dollars went up slightly, as we deployed incremental capacity to targeted clients. And our dollars of expected profit per dollar of expected loss increased very meaningfully. Similar factors played out in our international markets, where rate increases significantly overachieved expectations as we were coming into the end of the year. And on average, our international markets took 40 points of rate including over 30 points of rate in the U.K., which hasn't seen a major CAT loss in decades. So simply put, on the property CAT side, it was a fantastic 1/1. And I think we expect those conditions to play out through the remainder of this year and into next year. So just exceptional. And so when you think about the resulting PMLs of that, what I would share with you is the comparison you always want to be making is quarter-to-quarter because what you're looking at is an analysis of our in-force book. And what I would -- the way I would characterize our PML movement is the PMLs that we publish were essentially flat. And you see some ups and downs in those PMLs on a net basis, they were essentially flat. And that translates into more deployment of some gross capacity, offset by improved AUM in Mt. Logan, and that gets you to a roughly flat P&L picture. My expectation is we'll probably remain in that sort of territory. We feel really good about our ability to get those incredible economics without really having to stretch the CAT appetite. And as you'll see in the investor presentation in terms of where we are in our earnings and capital at risk measures, we continue to trade well within our defined range, which we're very comfortable with. So it's really the best of all worlds where we're able to get rate that improves economics, overcomes the inflationary factors that you see in the market and do it while maintaining our risk position in a pretty stable manner. So really could not be happier with the results we achieved. Yaron Kinar : Thanks Jim, that's very helpful. And my follow-up to that then would be, if I were to try and take that commentary and color and translate that into the combined ratio, so I think you've stated that you expected 91, 93 reported combined. Would you be surprised to see that come in well below that 91 to 93 range in a \"normal CAT\" year in '23? And would you expect to give us an updated number at some point this year? Juan Andrade : Yaron, this is Juan Andrade. Look, what I would echo is a couple of things. I mean if you look at the 20% net income ROE that we generated in the fourth quarter, 19% operating ROE, which, again, it's an excellent result, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly in the market environment that we're in right now. In addition to that, you layer the amount of rate that Jim and I just talked about, over 50% on U.S. CAT XOL, over 40% in our European businesses, et cetera. You talk about the terms and conditions that I referred to earlier in my remarks, which are also significant changes. And all of this is very much accretive to our portfolio. In addition to that, you also look at the work that has been done on the primary insurance side and just the margin improvement that we've been able to drive through 2022. So all of that leads you to a place that I say, we're in a good place. And I would not be surprised if we end up being on the better end of that range. Yaron Kinar : And would you expect to give us an update at some point and a hard number? Juan Andrade : Yes. For us, we're expecting to do another Investor Day towards the end of this year. And at that point, we will be updating our numbers and our financials. This will be the third year of our three year numbers that we put out there initially back in 2021. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. And good luck in the year ahead. Juan Andrade : Thanks Yaron. Operator : Our next question today comes from Brian Meredith, UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Juan, it sounds like you're going to update premium guidance also in November? Juan Andrade : Yes. Look, I think by then, we're going to have a pretty good idea of how the environment is shaping. But I think, Brian, if you go back to, again, in my prepared remarks, we just renewed 53% of the reinsurance book at very attractive terms. And as I said in my comments, we also expect that 4/1, 6/1 and 7/1 will continue to be very favorable for the reinsurance industry. So I think that also gives us a pretty good idea as to where that might be shaping. In addition to that, I would also say on the primary side, we also would expect pricing to continue to improve, as I mentioned in my remarks, and frankly, we already saw some of that in the fourth quarter, right, where we saw commercial auto, property and general liability make some significant improvements quarter-over-quarter on the pricing. We're in a heightened risk environment. You've got pressure from the reinsurance hard market. And so I would expect that all of these things will lead to a very good trajectory on the growth. But yes, we will be providing additional guidance later in the year when we do our Investor Day. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then second question, Juan, I'm just curious, how do you think about allocating your PML on the property side between the insurance and the reinsurance business? I mean would you hold back some on the reinsurance because of opportunities? On primary is there one that you prefer a little bit more than the other? How do you think about that? Juan Andrade : Yes. No, that's a great question, Brian. One of the terms that we like to use inside our company is that we do quite a bit of dynamic capital allocation. So this is, frankly, a fundamental discipline that we have with our enterprise risk management framework. On a very regular basis, we're essentially looking at by line of business, where we're coming in against expected returns, et cetera. And so that's how we start deciding who gets the capital. What we do not do is peanut butter this around the company, right? So we will look at the market opportunity. We look at where we think we can get the best economics, the best risk adjust good returns, and that's essentially how we deploy the capital. And it's an important point because I think you heard both me and Jim Williamson talk about the precision with which 1/1 was executed. And I think it's important to step back to understand that in order to get to the heart of your question. And it's the fact that we have pretty good control of our business around the world. So we are able to decide whether we're going to deploy more capital in the U.S. versus in the Continental Europe versus in Asia versus Latin America, depending on the market conditions. And we apply that same rigor across the segments, whether it's in primary insurance or whether it's on the reinsurance side of things. And that's ultimately how we make those decisions. But I would invite either Jim or Mark to maybe provide some additional comments on that as well. James Williamson : Yes. No, Brian, it's Jim. I think that's spot on. I think clearly, what you've seen is a situation, particularly as we came into 1/1, where it took the primary market a little while to start to adjust to what was coming in terms of insurance rates. And our primary insurance business has been very disciplined on their portfolio management. And in some ways, that's freeing up capacity and thereby capital that we were able to very effectively deploy in reinsurance at 1/1. And that's, I think, really brings to life that dynamic capital allocation that Juan is mentioning. And we are very nimble that way, and it allows us to really achieve best-in-class returns. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks, and good morning. First question is, I know this is only one piece of the changes at 1/1, but I'm trying to get a sense of the significance of higher reinsurance attachment points. Is there any way of maybe recasting 2022 losses in this new framework, just to give us a sense of how much difference that particular step make? James Williamson : Sure, Meyer. This is Jim Williamson. It is a very important point. And actually, I think the fourth quarter gives us a little bit of a demonstration of that because we began a lot of these strategies really long before 1/1 '23. And if you think about how we execute in 1/1 '22 and the actions that we told you we were taking, it was all about moving away from lower-performing programs, particularly pro rata deals; moving away from high volatility structures, particularly around retro, around aggregate programs; making sure that we were deploying capacity where risk-adjusted returns warranted it, which is why we withdrew some capacity at 1/1 '22 and then started deploying it back into the market as conditions improve. And what does that do? For losses like -- what happened in the fourth quarter with Elliot. In our view, losses like that should be primarily retained by seeds. That's really not a type of loss that should be a fundamental loss to the reinsurance market. And you saw our Q4 CAT loss for reinsurance was relatively small, $10 million. And that is the type of loss we want for events like that. So that gives you a sense of how we think our book will perform over time. So if in 2023, there's a number of, what we would call, frequency CATS the $1 billion, $2 billion events, our expectation is our participation in those events will be lower than they would have been prior to 1/1 '23 because the average attachment point moved up our cedings are going to be retaining more of those losses net into their portfolio, which is where those losses belong. And that allows us to really preserve our capacity for major industry events, which is one of the products designed for. So that should give you a flavor of how we expect the portfolio to perform. Meyer Shields : Okay. That is very helpful. The second question is there -- and I apologize if I missed this. I'm just looking for any thoughts on ceding commission changes, both as a reinsurer and on the insurance book? James Williamson : Yes, Meyer, this is Jim. I'll start and then turn it over to my colleague, Mike Karm. Yes, so we did see really excellent results in our casualty renewal as well. Obviously, a lot of attention being paid to property and rightfully so. But we enjoy a premier position with many of our seats on their casualty portfolios, and we participated in this cycle of market hardening over the last few years by taking increasing share of casualty programs for those core clients, mainly on a pro rata basis. And one of the things that's happened is all that margin is getting accreted in the primary market as you've seen ceding commissions go up, we think that made sense. It was a reasonable trade. It was still resulting in more margin for us. So we like that. What we're starting to see now is still very attractive opportunity. We did continue to participate very meaningfully at 1/1 in the programs I'm describing. In fact, in a number of cases, we increased participation and I think, grew our portfolio in a really nice fashion. But what we also saw is obviously the amount of margin expansion in the primary market is narrowing a bit. And so we started to see ceding commissions certainly leveling off. I really only have full -- a small handful of instances where they continue to increase, and that was usually when they were already below market to begin with. What we saw mostly was a modest improvement in average ceding commissions across the portfolio, and we think that's justified. And our expectation is that, that phenomenon of moderating ceding commissions will continue to play out as we go forward. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Karmilowicz : Sure. Thanks, Jim. For us, it's rod striking the right balance about retaining harder and earning profit while managing our volatility and really actually, as we continue to scale up our businesses. With given the reinsurance market and what's happening, we're certainly not immune to what is going on. But I would say we're also not reliant on reinsurance like others. And given our financial strength and our capital -- strong capital base, we will continue to be -- have all the flexibility in the world here to drive what we need to do as an organization. And for us, again, it's about being thoughtful as we retain more premium for our risk. There'll be more accretive to our portfolio and whatever economics nor to our benefit will continue to drive. So I think given where we are in the position of how we scale up our businesses, we feel we're in a good position, and I don't think there'll be anything material that we're concerned about driving our overall strategy. Juan Andrade : Yes. Meyer, this is Juan. I think look, just to round out the answer, I think at the end of the day, bottom line is we saw improvement in cede commissions in this renewal. Meyer Shields : Okay. Fantastic. That was very thorough. Very helpful. Juan Andrade : Thanks Meyer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I want to go back to the 1/1s, right? You guys spoke about the expected return increasing materially I'm not sure what color or numbers you want to give us, but like -- could you say what the expected return on your business would be in a normal CAT year? Or, for instance, if we looked at the 11% return you guys generated in '22, what would that be if last year's events recurred? Just something to give us a sense of just how much better the expected return is in '23 relative to '22 given, right, the better pricing and the improved terms and conditions? James Williamson : Sure. Yes. Elyse, this is Jim Williamson, and I'll provide you some of that color. And maybe at the risk of repeating some of what I said, but I do think it's really critical. If you think about our objectives coming into renewal were pretty straightforward, and they're very similar to what we focused on last year. Continue to optimize the portfolio and move away from underperforming programs; control volatility, particularly around how we structure deals and for that -- for us, that means mainly avoiding aggregate structures and minimizing the amount of capacity we have deployed at really high return probability layers like the 1 in 3 type of player, that's not really where we want to be playing. And then ensuring that we're moving capacity to the best-in-class programs. And that same phenomenon that we've consistently executed through 2022 played out in January 1. And so we were able to take capacity from, let's say, the bottom tier of our programs and reallocate it to the best opportunities in the market. We did it with significant rate increases as Juan and I have mentioned 50% in the U.S., 40% in international markets. As you mentioned, there was also significant movement in terms and conditions. In particular, in the U.S., a significant portion of our deals are on -- now on a named peril only basis. We've also eliminated write-backs of exclusions on a number of areas that will over time result in better economics. And so the heart of your question of what does that mean for the portfolio in practical terms? Obviously, every year will present us with a different set of actual catastrophes. And so as opposed to looking back, what I would tell you, how I would expect the portfolio to perform is that frequency pass, which have really been deviled the reinsurance industry, will increasingly be retained by our customers. So we're getting a lot more rate to now focus on the types of losses that reinsurance was designed to cover in the first place. We would also expect for major losses that similar to what happened with Hurricane Ian, and we're very thoughtful about how much of a share of the major losses that we want to be taking, and I would expect that to look quite good as well. And then lastly, what I would say for all of this, we have a meaningful increase in the amount of cat premium available to pay these losses and still make a strong return. So hopefully, that gives you the color that would help you to triangulate what is an excellent expected return position as we move through 2023. Juan Andrade : Elyse, and this is Juan. Let me piggyback on Jim's answer and because I think he was quite thorough. And I would point you back to that 20% ROE that we just talked about for the fourth quarter. And then we put it in perspective, right, because while we don't give specific guidance on what we think the ROE outlook is going to be for the coming year, we still generated double-digit ROEs despite the industry facing a top 5 catastrophe year. And I think you got to put those results in the context of all the activities that we have been talking about really over the past three years on how we have been managing this company, reducing the volatility, being very disciplined in portfolio management, being very disciplined with where we deploy our capital. And with the material improvements that we achieved at 1/1 that we just talked about and that we expect to expand upon in the coming renewals, we expect that steady improvement to continue. And so I would say all signs point to a significantly improved risk-adjusted return across the portfolio. So just a little bit more color on that. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then the equity portfolio went down from $1.3 billion to like $281 million in the quarter. Why did you guys take that portfolio down in the fourth quarter? Mark Kociancic : Good morning, Elyse, it's Mark. So we have a strategic asset allocation table that we're pretty disciplined with. And it allows us flexibility to move between asset classes, whether it's on the fixed income side, private equity, public equity, private credit, et cetera, et cetera. So tactically, we had a large reduction of the equity portfolio in the fourth quarter, shifted into other assets that we felt were more attractive, but still consistent with that strategic asset allocation that we've been focused on since the 2021 Investor Day. So we will probably move around a bit in 2023, but stay disciplined to that SAA. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from C. Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Charles Peters : Well, good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to, I think, in your comments, you talked about the annual ground-up reserve review that you do every year. And especially on the primary side, obviously, inflation is been a big issue in the statistics that came out in '22 couldn't have been anticipated in fiscal year '20 and '19. So can you talk to us about the process? What were the puts and takes for you to come out where you did? Some perspective there would be helpful. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Good morning. It's Mark. So let me get into that just in a few ways. The process itself is year-round. And so we're looking at reserves throughout the year, performing reserve studies. It's quite comprehensive in terms of aligning, underwriting, pricing, reserving claims in the course of that process. So you've got many different stakeholders involved. And then it's quite ground up in terms of the analytics that go into it. And then I'd bring you back to principles that we set out back in 2020 about setting up prudent loss picks holding them in a disciplined fashion over time until we see a seasoning in the different lines of business. And for us, those are kind of a ground up rules and processes that we use to evaluate. Now in terms of what we did in Q4, I mentioned the asbestos and environmental reserves strengthening. So we've got roughly $20 billion of carried net reserves. We strengthened that by 138. We had some offsets, favorable offsets coming from shorter tail line and we had smaller, more marginal adjustments, pluses and minuses in both segments, but nothing approaching the 138 in the process. So overall, we feel very solid in terms of our loss position. And we obviously take into account macro factors like loss inflation by making sure that we've got prudent loss picks in our reserves. And then we do dynamic modeling. And I think one of the benefits that we have in our company is really the diversified nature of the lines of business that we have and the reserve profile that we have. There is no single emphasis on one class, and that diversification helps to absorb any potential volatility that might come from loss inflation factors, in general. So that gives us, I think, just a better mix or diversification of reserves to handle these types of issues. Charles Peters : Got it. I guess -- so my follow-up question, well, sticking with the specialty insurance platform. We look at your primary growth 18% for the year, I think, 19% for the quarter. I think after we get through earnings season, that's going to be a pretty outstanding result relative to some of your peer groups. So could you spend a minute and talk to us about where you're seeing growth? I guess, not only looking back to '22, but when we think about '23? Michael Karmilowicz : Sure. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. We have a lot of moving pieces in the organization, but the reality is our underwriting profit focus is, first and foremost, the number one thing we tend to focus on. And given that with all the things we have from scaling up our existing businesses and given our market share and given the opportunity we have with our expansion, you're starting to see a lot of these things play out. So when I think about the opportunity for that growth, it's not without discipline and cycle management that comes along with that growth. But for us, we see what the market opportunity lies in front of us. So we have the expertise we can deploy anywhere in the world now with the expansion now starting to play through and some of the things we've done, you're starting to see that come into play. And in addition to that, we have the ability to have the flexibility rather to drive this in a local region. So I think growth has been great, 32 straight quarters. The specialty businesses where we see areas like we opened up and you saw adding to that, which would be aviation and energy and construction, complementing our credit political risk and surety, helping offset some of the things that are happening with like transaction liability, then you go over to some of the market and property. And when we have and see these things that are actually opening themselves up, we can do this anywhere in the world. And I think for us, our benefit has been our agility and the way we actually are able to capitalize with our speed to market. And we'll continue to do this. We're going to refine our offering, whether it's retail or wholesale. We're going to figure out where the opportunity is globally. And if we don't like what we see from a risk-adjusted return basis, we'll pull back, and we'll do the right thing. You've seen that with our cycle management and comp. You see that we're doing in D&O and if we don't see those things, we're going to sit there and we'll continue to look for opportunity where it best fits and the growth just comes with that. And so we'll continue to drive that opportunity where we see it, and it's about playing offense and not defense. Juan Andrade : Yes, Greg, this is Juan Andrade. I would add a couple of thoughts because I think that was well said by Mike. Look, I think at the end of the day, there's a couple of key factors. One, we're highly diversified within the Primary Insurance division. And so that means that we can find opportunities in the market where they exist. And as Mike pointed out, it's always about profitability. So for instance, is you're not seeing a good environment for financial lines right now, but you're seeing a very good environment for things like property, casualty still and other lines of business. So that allows us to essentially pick our spots and be able to do that. The other point that I don't think can be underestimated is really the agility of our company. And I mentioned that in our prepared remarks, our ability to be able to pivot. We're pretty lean, we're pretty entrepreneurial, we have great relationships with our distribution, and we have a lot of good talent in this company. And all of these things are basically what enable us to continue the momentum that you have seen from us really over the last number of years. Charles Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Juan Andrade : Thanks Greg. Operator : And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski : Hi, good morning. Maybe first question, thinking about capital management and capital uses. Should we expect a bit more kind of operating leverage? So when we look at the premiums to equity ratio, is there room for that to inch up given kind of better economics you're attaining? And also just thinking about capital uses in '23, should we be still thinking that the growth will kind of eat up most of the capital versus buybacks? Mark Kociancic : Mike, it's Mark. So a few points here. I do think we've got ample capital to take on the opportunities of 2023, and it includes more than just the traditional balance sheet. You're looking at what we call our capital shield, so Logan ILWs, CAT bonds, et cetera. Operating leverage, there's definitely more room on the balance sheet to expand that leverage. I think one of the key points to keep in mind is really the risk-adjusted return profile is improving. So you're seeing exposure being managed thoughtfully and the rate and the expected return go up significantly. And that's one of the key points that I think allows us to expand that operating leverage. We're also fairly well diversified with multiple income streams. And so I do expect the net income projections for the year to provide significant retained earnings to support growth. And we'll see how that growth comes about because there are other levers that we can pull if the opportunities in the market are even more significant than what we think they could be. But just in terms of your buyback comment, look, it's always on the table. We can pull that lever, but this is the best market we've seen in a generation. And so the value creation that comes out of the organic growth plan that we've got and the fact that we're ready for it in terms of balance sheet, teams, franchise, the whole ball of wax, you couldn't have a better alignment. So I think you'll see us really attack this opportunity in 2023 full borne. So I'll leave it there. Michael Zaremski : That's helpful. My follow-up is on the alternative reinsurance, maybe ILS marketplace, given Mt. Logan is one of the leaders in that space. Is there -- are you seeing dislocation in that marketplace? And do you see that kind of persisting? I know there's some puts and takes on how that impacts someone like Everest. But what's going on in the ILS marketplace that you're seeing? And does that -- is that part of the reason you feel that the discipline within the overall reinsurance marketplace will continue? James Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. I mean clearly, ILS has been a dislocated market coming into 1/1. And for many of the reasons that have affected everyone participating in this market, there have been a lot of CAT losses over the last few years. And I think, particularly around the margins, you had a lot of investors participating in ILS vehicles and maybe didn't quite understand or weren't quite prepared for the prospects of having multiple years in a row of CAT activity, which is not uncommon. These clusters happen. And so that has definitely, I think, put a number of investors in a position where they're on pause. You also have, obviously, the phenomena from those CAT losses, there's a lot of trapped capital that is just sidelined no matter what rates, terms and conditions are doing, they just can't deploy that capacity because it's preserved against prior events. And so that has definitely created and helped to contribute to a capacity crunch in our industry. Now from our perspective, that affects us in two ways. On the one hand, in our primary reinsurance business, our balance sheet reinsurance business, if you will, we're seeing all the phenomenal results that we've talked about plus 50, U.S. property CAT pricing plus 40 international terms and conditions getting better attachment points rising. And that's all happening because there's more demand for reinsurance capacity than there is supply. And part of the reason that's occurred is because of the crunch in ILS. The second thing that it does is it makes it a little more challenging for us to raise funds in Mt. Logan because investors are sidelined or they have trapped capital. In terms of that trade, we'll take that trade all day long. Driving improvement in our core reinsurance business is our first priority. And it also inures to the benefit of our Mt. Logan investors who are consistently invested in the ILS space, they get better returns as well. So we like that. At the same time, what I would say is, we have been getting traction in Logan. We did raise money in 1/1. And the team is doing an excellent job of conveying our value proposition to potential investors. And in particular, unlike a lot of other vehicles in the market, our investors get the same results that Everest gets. We're not making money when they're not making money. So that's a real focus of ours. And I think that's very compelling. We have a strong pipeline of investor interest, and our expectation is that Mt. Logan will grow over the course of time, and that's a key priority for us. Michael Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Good morning, guys. Just a few, hopefully, quick ones for Jim. First question, just, I guess, following up on Mayer and Elyse's line questioning on how the changes in the portfolio might map to the actual CAT numbers. So you mentioned that you're shying away from kind of like the 1-in-3 type of risk, but -- what I'm struggling with is that like in the supplement, the 1 in 20 looked like it grew about as much as the 1 in 250. So from the PML disclosures alone, it's difficult for me to really see what's going on. So I don't know the right way to ask it, maybe -- could you give us some idea over the past few years, like how much of your CAT losses have come from sort of those frequency layers that were even more frequent than 1 in 20? I'm not really sure, but just any numbers would be helpful. James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Ryan. Yes, it's Jim, obviously. Look, it's an important question. And so I'm going to give you a few threads that I think really help describe what's happening in the portfolio. So obviously, and I can't restate it enough, exceptional execution at 1/1 which really followed on really strong execution in 2022, as we reposition the portfolio and rightsized our CAT risk for our company and a go-forward and sustainable basis, and that's really critical work. What I would do, if you want to think about movement of P&L, first of all, I wouldn't look at it on a year-over-year basis. Too much has changed since 1/1 '22. I'd really look at our more recent PMLs, whether you want to pick 10/1 or 7/1. And I think that shows what is essentially a flat profile of PML deployment at a variety of return periods, whether it's 1 in 20 or 1 in 250, 1 in 250 is down by about $50 million from 10/1. 1 in 20 is essentially the same number, it's down by $5 million. And so that gives you some sense of what we expect. What I would say in terms of the balance of where CAT losses have been going in the industry is, it's not so much that what percent is the 1-in-3 event versus the 1-in-20 event. It's where are you getting appropriately paid? Where are you getting reasonable risk-adjusted returns? And so for us, our portfolio has shifted clearly toward the areas where risk-adjusted returns are strong and warrant the risk we're taking. And that's the 1 in 20 to 1 in 250 range. We feel really good about that. The other thing to keep in mind that's been happening against the backdrop of all this is the discipline required in the underwriting and the terms and conditions to ensure that you're inflation loading, your programs appropriately. Those are all things which will also over time and order the benefit of our portfolio. Now obviously, the actual result is going to be highly dependent on which events occur. But if we have a year where you have a couple of large events, but you also have a frequency of smaller CATS, we think our portfolio will perform better now -- meaningfully better now than it would have a year ago and that's because of all the actions we take in the rate all the improvements we've made. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on how to interpret those PMLs. Ryan Tunis : Yes, that's helpful. And then just lastly, can you give us an update on kind of how you're thinking about your original Hurricane Ian impact? James Williamson : Yes. Sure. Yes, Ryan, it's Jim again. Yes, we feel very good about it. I mean, obviously, it seems like it was a long time ago, but it's still relatively early. As you've seen, there have been puts and takes in the industry in terms folks adjusting their view of what their ultimate loss is going to be in terms of our clients' scenes, and so we're watching that very closely. A key thing to keep in mind, which we communicated in the last quarterly call when we talked about Ian is in terms of any upside risk to the numbers we've put up, we feel very good about that because of the protection that we received from our cap-on program. As we had indicated, in the last call, we have about $350 million of potentially exposed cap-on limit, which will engage if PCS reaches $48.1 billion in their estimate. They're currently at $47.4 million and we'll recover on a pro rata basis up to $64 billion or $63.8 billion. So we don't really have any kind of material concern about upside to that number, whether it ultimately there's a good guy in there, it's going to take quite a bit of time for that to play out, but we're watching it very closely. Ryan Tunis : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any final remarks. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion this morning. This is Juan Andrade. I am very optimistic about the opportunities ahead and our ability to continue driving a world-class platform. Our strategy is clear. Our businesses are growing with strong resilient portfolios, and we have an attractive risk-return profile. This is all underpinned by our strong culture, which is an increasingly significant competitive advantage. We will expand on this foundation to accelerate our progress and create increased value for our investors, colleagues and clients around the world. Thank you for your time with us today and for your continued support of our company. I look forward to speaking with all of you again when we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Everest Re Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Re Group Limited first quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today\u2019s call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments on today\u2019s call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I will turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest started off strong in 2023, with significant growth, increased underwriting profits and operating ROE over 17% and total shareholder return in excess of 14%. We continue to diversify and expand our plan with both of our underwriting businesses delivering profitable broad-based growth. In reinsurance, our leadership position was abundantly clear in the ongoing hard market flight to quality. Our team\u2019s consistent execution resulted in record gross written premiums and expanded margins. We continue to invest in scaling our primary business while remaining disciplined. We capitalized on the diversification of our portfolio and strong pricing environment. This led to stronger underwriting profits over last year. Everest is uniquely positioned to succeed in this market. We are bringing the full power of the Everest global franchise, together with underwriting discipline and the best talent in the business to drive sustainable returns. With that, I will turn to our first quarter financial highlights beginning at the group level. Group underwriting profit, net investment income, operating income and net income all increased meaningfully in the quarter. Growth was excellent and we continue to see great opportunities for continued expansion. We grew gross written premiums by almost 20% in constant dollars year-over-year, led by the reinsurance division, which achieved record quarterly premiums. Continued rate increases, exposure growth and strong underwriting discipline create margin expansion and keep us ahead of loss trend. We delivered $443 million in net operating income, up over 9% from prior year. The group combined ratio was 91.2%, a 40 basis point improvement from last year. It includes 3.7 points of catastrophe losses from the Turkey earthquake and the New Zealand floods and typhoon. We have no meaningful loss activity from the spring storms in the U.S. as our derisking efforts continue to manifest themselves in both our reinsurance and insurance results. We improved our attritional loss ratio 30 basis points year-over-year, reflecting pricing momentum and improving terms. Underwriting profits were $273 million, which are among the company\u2019s highest orderly results over the past 5 years. Turning to investments, our high-quality portfolio produced net investment income of $260 million, a 7% improvement from prior year, driven by higher new money yields. Now turning to our reinsurance business. Reinsurance delivered an outstanding first quarter performance, with significant top and bottom line growth. We capitalized on our well-positioned and scalable reinsurance franchise, our leadership position, the heart of property cat market and our deep client and broker relationships, resulting in excellent outcomes for the portfolio at the January 1 and April 1 renewals. The precise and disciplined execution by our reinsurance team positioned Everest to succeed in this dynamic market. We targeted attractive opportunities to grow with trusted partners and materially improved risk-adjusted returns. Our practice of setting clear and consistent expectations early with clients and brokers led to significant improvements in pricing and terms and conditions across our portfolio, while building long-term relationship equity. That excess of loss pricing is excellent with risk-adjusted rate changes at January 1 of plus 50% in North America, and over 40% international. Casualty lines, average rate increases continue to exceed trend. Importantly, our team was distinguished as the preferred reinsurance market by being proactive and constructive with our customers. The value we created with our partners gives us a competitive advantage, helps us deepen our relationships and creates new opportunities. Our momentum continued at the April redo, where pricing remained strong, up 44% in North America and 26% in international. This builds on prior rate increases in 2022 with expected returns consistent with the levels we saw at January 1. We grew strategically, most notably in specialty lines, such as marine and aviation, with strong risk-adjusted returns. We expect to benefit from improvements in ceding commissions for the remainder of the year. We expect the strong market conditions to continue through 2023 and into 2024, and we remain on offense in this robust market. Reinsurance top line results were excellent, up 23% on a constant dollar basis, with $2.6 billion in gross written premiums. As I mentioned earlier, this is a quarterly record. Growth was broad-based by line and geography, up double digits across every business unit. Property cat premiums were up 28% from last year, along with casualty and property pro rata premiums at 22% and 19%, respectively. We delivered a 17% increase in underwriting profit to $207 million on a 90.8% combined ratio, a 60 basis point improvement from 2022. This included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $108 million, net of estimated recoveries and restatement premiums for the Turkey earthquakes and New Zealand floods and typhoon. Our deliberate efforts to optimize our portfolio and reduce cat volatility continue to improve our portfolio economics. Both the attritional loss ratio at 58% and the attritional combined ratio at 85.9% improved down 90 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. Remember, many of the rate and margin improvements made at January 1 and April 1, will take several quarters to earn into our financial results. This should be a meaningful benefit for earned premium throughout the year. As we head into the upcoming renewals, our value proposition and relationships in the market have never been stronger. We will continue to bolster our global leadership position and maximize our portfolio\u2019s performance. Now turning to insurance, where we delivered another solid performance in the first quarter. We achieved a 92.4% combined ratio in line with our previous assumption, resulting in an underwriting profit of $66 million, up 12% year-over-year. We continue to grow and develop our world-class talent, capabilities and value proposition to enhance our portfolio and increase average share of the global insurance market. We grew the insurance segment by nearly 12% in constant dollars, and generated over $1 billion in premiums for the eighth consecutive quarter. Growth was broad geographically driven by a diversified mix across property and specialty lines, particularly strong in marine, energy and construction. We remain cautious in certain lines, including monolines worker compensation and public company D&O. We also benefited from pricing improvements in the first quarter. We achieved an 8% rate increase, excluding workers\u2019 compensation across the portfolio, led by property and excess liability with continued strong rate across other lines. This is the second sequential quarter with an increase in the overall level of rate changes achieved. We expect the hard market in reinsurance to put upward pressure on primary insurance pricing. This dynamic should extend the favorable pricing environment and insurance for the foreseeable future and will also benefit our pro rata business in the reinsurance segment. Despite severe weather in the U.S. in the quarter, our cat losses were immaterial at $2 million. The overall cat result reflects our disciplined portfolio management actions to reduce volatility over the last several years across the company. The attritional loss ratio was 64.2 up modestly year-over-year, primarily due to a current accident year adjustment to a single medical stop-loss program, which we non-renewed. Mark will provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Throughout the first quarter, we continued to prudently manage the business, balancing investments in our people and infrastructure as we build the company for the future. We are streamlining and scaling our operations to serve the market with greater efficiency, connectivity and agility as we grow. We are well positioned to seize attractive opportunities in this environment. We are expanding our breadth of innovative products and advancing our leadership across the global P&C market anchored by our underwriting discipline. Our sites are set firmly on shareholders, clients and colleagues as we take full advantage of the robust opportunities in this market. With that, I will turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan and good morning everyone. As Juan mentioned, Everest had a strong start to the year. The company reported operating income of $443 million or $11.31 per diluted share in the quarter. The operating ROE was 17.2% for the quarter, while total shareholder return, or TSR, stands at 14.1% year-to-date. We improved our overall attritional loss ratio while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars in both segments as pricing and terms remain attractive in a number of lines \u2013 business around the globe. The company\u2019s strong performance in the first quarter was led by our team\u2019s high level of execution in our core markets, and we have a number of tailwinds that are back throughout the remainder of the year. Looking at the group results for the first quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.7 billion, representing 17.5% growth year-over-year or 19.5% growth in constant dollars. The combined ratio was 91.2%, which includes 3.7 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Group attritional loss ratio was 59.7%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year\u2019s quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The group\u2019s commission ratio improved 40 basis points to 21.3% on mix changes, while the group expense ratio was 6.4%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. The reinsurance gross premiums written grew 23.2% in constant dollars during the quarter. The strong growth came from the successful execution of our 1/1 renewal strategy. A significant amount of the premium growth came from property and casualty pro rata treaties, which will earn in more gradually in excess of loss treaties over the coming quarters. As Juan said, this will be beneficial to earn premium for the rest of the year. We generated double-digit growth in all three of our operating divisions, North America, International and Global Fac. The combined ratio was 90.8%, which includes 5 points related to the Turkish earthquake and New Zealand floods, as Juan noted earlier. Despite these events, our loss experience came in lower than our planned cat mode. The attritional loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 58% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted margin potential. The commission ratio was 25%, broadly in line with last year. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.8%, modestly higher year-over-year, largely driven by the timing of certain expenses. We remain focused on operational efficiency across the entire company. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 11.5% in constant dollars to $1.1 billion, which is impacted by the seasonality and tends to be our lowest quarterly production. Growth was primarily driven by property and specialty lines in the quarter as pricing gained additional momentum from the fourth quarter and remains well ahead of loss trend. The combined ratio was 92.4%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. The attritional loss ratio was higher this quarter at 64.2% as we took a onetime increase in the current accident year on our medical stop-loss business of $15 million. A portion of our medical stop-loss portfolio saw an increase in large loss activity. We isolated the poor claim performance to a single block of business, took decisive action and nonrenewed it. Best of the medical stop-loss book is performing within expectations. When assessing any book of business, we want to make sure we are as proactive as possible at triangulating and mitigating any losses as soon as possible. Commission ratio improved 70 basis points, largely driven by business mix. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 15.9%, which is within our expectations as we continue to expand our global footprint and continue to proactively invest in a number of growth initiatives across the business. We expect to achieve a mid-15% insurance expense ratio by year-end 2023. And we also reaffirmed the 91% and 93% combined ratio assumption for insurance. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet. Net investment income for the quarter was $260 million, with interest income coming in at $264 million, alternative assets at $7 million before expenses of $12 million. We continue to see the benefit of higher new money yields in the fixed income portfolio, while alternative returns should pick up in coming quarters, assuming the broader market remains positive. Overall, our book yield improved from 2.5% to 3.8% year-over-year, and our reinvestment rate remains well north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3 years. And as a reminder, approximately 20% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the first quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 9.2%, benefiting from the geographic distribution of our income streams and thus favorable to our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders\u2019 equity ended the quarter at $9 billion or $10.5 billion, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities. At the end of the quarter, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.5 billion, $250 million lower as compared to year-end 2022. Cash flow from operations were strong at just under $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $229.49, a sequential improvement of 7.2% adjusted for dividends of $1.65 per share. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $266.64 versus $259.18 per share at the end of 2022, representing an annualized increase of approximately 3%. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 22.2%, modestly lower on a sequential basis. In conclusion, Everest ended the first quarter of 2023 in a strong position, with good momentum heading into the upcoming quarters, we continue to see good opportunities to invest in the platform and scalability of our company. That summarizes our first quarter results. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Rohrmann : Thanks Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And today\u2019s first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, starting with reinsurance. I appreciate the comments on the call, pointing to it taking time for some of these rate increases to earn in. Just hoping to get a little bit more color on just the cadence of this and how you expect like the strong rates you talked about at 1/1 as well as at 4/1 to earn into your margin, right? So how should that 58% underlying loss ratio that you saw within reinsurance trend over the balance of the year? Juan Andrade : That\u2019s great, Elyse. This is Juan Andrade. Good to hear from you. Let me kick it off in first of all, by saying our operating performance for the quarter was excellent. As I just talked about in my opening remarks, we had significant top line growth. We had underwriting profit, operating income and net income all up meaningfully quarter, generating a 17% operating ROE and a 14% TSR. And I mentioned all of this because we\u2019re just getting started. And so directly to your question, it\u2019s important to understand that the current environment, particularly in reinsurance, is providing us with meaningful margin expansion. We expect to grow rapidly in 2023 as our reinsurance franchise is very scalable. And our combined ratio should continue to improve on the strength of the rate and improved terms and conditions and mix of business. Now directly to your question, I think it\u2019s also important to understand that the earned premium that we saw come through in the first quarter of the year was really mostly from the fourth quarter of 2022, which basically means that as this earns in into the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be earning in at those much higher rate levels that we experienced at January 1 and that we are now experiencing at the April 1 renewals at the same time. So again, I think the timing of this is going to be over the next few quarters for the rest of the year, but I expect this to be very accretive and to have a positive impact on the portfolio. But let me ask Jim Williamson to maybe add a little bit of color just to give you some perspective, particularly on the 4/1. Jim Williamson : Yes. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And I think to add some color to what Juan laid out, just want to give you a little more perspective on what we\u2019re actually seeing under the covers, particularly starting with the Jan 1 renewal and then continuing. And a little bit of a view, if you don\u2019t mind, on where we see this market going. As Juan indicated, we had excellent operating performance in Q1, the Jan renewal and really in the lead up to the January renewal which really translated into us having a broad set of opportunities. And when I say broad, I really mean just about every class of business starting clearly with prop cat, but also including casualty, specialty lines, financial lines really in every market around the world. And our growth was very broad-based that way, including our North America treaty business, our international treaty business as well as facultative. And so when you think about us attacking that, clearly, Jan 1 renewal we talked about a plus 50% in North America, plus 40% international on property cat. That continued into the April renewal where we were over 40% in North America, mid to upper 20s internationally, which included markets that started taking rate in 2022. So that was exceptional. At the same time and very important and Mark had touched on this in his opening remarks, we also saw terrific opportunities in both casualty and property pro rata. And so we took those opportunities. And I think our ability to constructively engage our clients and cedents gave us preferred positioning around those opportunities. And what are we seeing? Well, on the casualty side, rate continues to stay ahead of trend. That\u2019s what our clients are experiencing. Ceding commissions are also starting to come down. And so those were terrific opportunities. We leaned into that. On the property side, our view is we\u2019re at the very beginning stages of a major correction in the primary property market. And we will get an opportunity to participate with our clients alongside them on a pro rata basis. And again, a very attractive ceding commission. So that was a meaningful part of our Q1 growth was in pro rata. And then as we go forward, the 4/1 renewal was outstanding, 5/1 renewal a little bit smaller, but also excellent results. And we\u2019re seeing a very consistent theme where property renewals as we go through the renewal period are achieving or exceeding the expected return levels we saw at January 1. And then I\u2019ll end at 6/1 because it is relatively imminent. But our view is that it will be very consistent with that. We think the market will continue to dislocate, we will have incredible opportunities to grow with our best-in-class clients and really allocate our capacity to superior returns. And again, I would expect that to be at or above what we saw at January 1. So all a tremendous amount of really high-quality opportunity that we\u2019re capturing. But to Juan\u2019s point, it is going to take time for that to earn into our portfolio. And you started to see it a little bit in the first quarter. Obviously, the effect of Jan 1 begins to earn in. An important point I would make on that earning is we are also at the same time that we\u2019re attacking this incredible opportunity. We\u2019re also being very prudent on our loss picks. Remember that cat XOL does not get booked at least at Everest with a 0% attritional loss ratio. We are booking a very prudent attritional loss ratio. And our hope, obviously, is that we don\u2019t need those dollars, but we want them to be there in the event that there are attritional cat losses that don\u2019t meet our cat threshold. And so over the next quarter, two quarters, three quarters, you will start to see that become a bigger and bigger part of our portfolio. And that will exert downward pressure on our loss ratio and our combined ratio. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is on the insurance margin, right? You guys had called out the medical stop loss, the impact in the quarter. So if we adjust for that, should we assume that the starting point for the second quarter and the rest of the year should be a 90% or better current accident year ex cat combined ratio in insurance given that, that medical stop lock issue isn\u2019t expected to repeat? Mark Kociancic : Elyse, it\u2019s Mark. Good morning. So look, we have the one bump in the medical stop loss this quarter. It\u2019s roughly $15 million charge. We are confirming, and I mentioned it in my script in the prepared remarks, 91% to 93% combined. So we feel very good about the margin that we\u2019re adding, the growth that we\u2019re adding both domestically and globally. So I think the attritional loss ratio is showing good improvement, definitely sustainable with the margins that we have, and we feel confident about remaining in that 91% to 93%. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. My first question goes to the loss picks. And I\u2019m just curious if you saw any increases in liability or financial lines loss picks, both in insurance and reinsurance? Jim Williamson : Yes. So Yaron, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start with reinsurance. So when I look at our loss picks for the first quarter, I\u2019d really indicate a few things. One, within casualty, obviously, we\u2019re always evaluating in a very granular way, our picks even at the subline level. And there were a number of puts and takes within casualty. But the overall casualty loss pick as it earned into the first quarter is very consistent with where we were last year. And our view is we\u2019re continuing to see rate in excess of trend. That\u2019s a good guide. At the same time, it\u2019s a pretty high-risk environment. And so we\u2019re being prudent about that. On the financial line side, that\u2019s for us, in reinsurance, that really means our mortgage portfolio. And again, we saw incredible opportunities in 2022, in particular, with to GSEs, which is a very high-margin business. But again, we\u2019re very prudent in the loss selections there and our loss picks 2023 are exactly the same as our loss picks in 2022 even though we\u2019ve been moving further away from loss. And then lastly, on property, on the XOL side, we do see improving loss picks over last year. But again, we\u2019re still being, I think, relatively prudent and we don\u2019t book cat XOL at zero. We\u2019re just a little under 20 for an attritional loss pick there, which is an improvement over last year. Yaron Kinar : Actually, I do have a second one, if I could. And just on premium growth, if I may. One, the XOL premium growth was clearly a bit lower than the pricing you saw in property cat. And I just want to confirm if that\u2019s a function of moving to higher layers? Or is it a function of shrinking limits? Or what\u2019s behind that? Jim Williamson : Yes, Yaron, it\u2019s Jim again. Look, I guess the way I would describe that is really in a couple of ways. One, the first thing we do when we\u2019re confronting the breadth of opportunity that I described in the earlier question, is we look to create our own capacity. So a lot of that is moving away from any area of the portfolio where we\u2019re not seeing the expected returns we want. An example of that, which was really a factor in 2022 as we were trimming some of our pro rata portfolios, which do have a heavy amount of premium with them. And then obviously, the second factor, as you described is we are moving further away from loss. And so you do tend to see lower premiums per dollar of exposure, all other things being equal. But what I would also say is all of these things are clearly not equal. The rates online that we\u2019re seeing in our portfolio overall from a cat XOL perspective are up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, even though we\u2019re moving further and further away from loss. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving what we expect to be a very strong premium growth, both in the first quarter and through the rest of the year. But what I would also say, and I think this is crucial, is our modeled expected profit is growing much faster than our written premium. And that\u2019s because you\u2019re seeing the scissoring of margin expansion happening in those cat XOL treaties, I think that\u2019s a really terrific result and our expectation is, and it\u2019s certainly been proven out. Jan 1, April 1, May 1, we believe June 1 and really through January 1, 2024, we expect that scissoring effect to continue. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Great. Ceding commissions improving. I believe on the reinsurance side, we mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks. Can you provide any updated color and let us know if one impacting the financial statements and if you expect that to continue into the midyear renewals? Jim Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have seen improved ceding commissions primarily driven on the casualty side, but also on the property pro rata side. Now remember, when we talk about improved ceding commissions, and we mentioned it in our fourth quarter call, when we were talking about the January 1 renewal, we\u2019re giving you indications on a written basis. And so what we had said last quarter, and I would repeat it, is that we\u2019ve seen about 1 point improvement in casualty ceding commissions and a little less than that on property, mainly because properties, ceding commissions were already relatively lean. We found them to be pretty attractive. So that\u2019s on a written basis. Now that\u2019s going to take time, similar to the other comments that we\u2019ve made, particularly when you\u2019re talking about pro rata premium that really earns over 2 years, it takes time for that to be reflected in the financials. So you really haven\u2019t started to see that yet, but we expect it to emerge over the coming quarters. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Also another follow-up on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, the optimism about the property side about beginning stages of a major correction, maybe you can kind of elaborate there, why we\u2019re in the beginning stages. Is this simply because some of the primaries are seeing their reinsurance rates go up a lot, and there is clearly a lot of replacement cost inflation. So the primaries are getting ahead of \u2013 trying to get ahead of an issue or \u2013 what are you seeing there? And why do you see that growth being so attractive if some of your primary partners see themselves as kind of being a bit behind the inflation curve? Juan Andrade : Yes. Mike, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start and then I\u2019ll ask Mike Karmilowicz to add something to this answer as well. Look, I think it all starts with the fact that we do have a structural supply and demand imbalance, that\u2019s taking place in both insurance and reinsurance, frankly, on property cat, right? So on the supply side of things, you have essentially less capacity being deployed by rated companies. You also have less of the ILS capital coming into the market. And on the demand side, we have all the issues that we\u2019ve all lived through together, right? You have inflation, which is putting upward pressure on values, there is volatility in the environment, social inflation and other things. So our ceding partners basically are requiring to buy more insurance, more reinsurance along those lines. So that structural supply and demand imbalance, I think, is really what begins part of the equation. Now Jim has talked about what we have seen on the property side in reinsurance, which is very attractive from a pricing perspective, and we expect to see that through January 1, 2024 maybe beyond. On the primary side, we\u2019re seeing basically the same things. We\u2019re now basically seeing property rates up in the high teens into the 20s. And if you\u2019re in wholesale, it\u2019s plus 30, right? So you\u2019re definitely seeing that. And keeping in mind that we have both a wholesale and a retail channel, we are getting that rate on both sides of the equation. So from our perspective, that also makes a lot of sense for us. Also keep in mind that we have also been derisking the insurance side of our business, not just the reinsurance side. It\u2019s one of the reasons why you don\u2019t see us picking up losses from the spring events in the U.S. Basically, we had $2 million of cat loss in the Insurance segment. So we are seeing pretty significant rate increases on the primary side. We have continued to de-risk and our strategy and property has moved more towards middle market retail than anything else. So all of these things, I think, is what makes it fairly attractive for us. But Mike, maybe you can add a few more... Mike Karmilowicz : Sure. No, I think that\u2019s well said, Juan. I guess I would just add a couple of other comments, Mike, to that. One, we continue to push out on the retail side. At the same time, given the market conditions, we\u2019ve been able to continue to deemphasize the concentration of risk, particularly in the peak zones, the cat prone zones, particularly in the wholesale market. In addition to that, we\u2019ve actually now basically helping out with our foundational work we do with our international expansion. We\u2019re now spreading that out and diversifying our portfolio across the globe, giving us a lot better balance and overall more risk-adjusted returns that are more consistent and sustainable over the long haul. Mike Zaremski : Great color. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Hi. First question, just looking at Florida renewals with the legislation that went through on what are your expectations or what that means for potential capital moving in? And how do you think Everest still position itself for that 6/1 renewal, meaning quota share versus excess of loss? Jim Williamson : Sure, Brian. It\u2019s Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, I mean, first of all, let me just say that our view on the reform that has occurred is it\u2019s incredibly constructive. I think the fact that the government in Florida was able to get such a broad-based perform past is just excellent work. And we think over time, that will be incredibly healthy for the Florida insurance market and will provide much needed relief for our homeowners there. At the same time, we think it\u2019s going to take time for the effects of that reform to prove itself. We don\u2019t expect the plaintiff bar to sit idly by while the reforms are implemented. And I think it remains a little bit to be seen on exactly what that will mean. And so we\u2019re being very cautious on that. Now we have been a very consistent provider of capacity to the Florida market. And our expectation is that will continue. And our view on pricing, terms and conditions in Florida, for 6/1, we expect really modeled returns to exceed what we saw at Jan 1. So we think 6/1 will be better than Jan 1. The headline rate increases may not be as large because we already took significant rate in \u201822 but the economics of those programs should be outstanding. And so our view is as long as that has proven to be true, we will continue to deploy a similar level of capacity to that market than we did in prior year. Now in terms of our participation, we\u2019re almost exclusively an XOL market in Florida. We do have a couple of targeted quota share deals, but they are a relatively small part of the portfolio. And I don\u2019t really expect that mix to change. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then my second question. I\u2019m just curious, of the cat loss, how big was Turkey. And then on that, I\u2019m just curious, given that those are types of programs that have fairly low rate on lines and I\u2019m not sure what the return dynamics are there. Why would you be running that type of business now given just the strength of pricing and the attractive returns in areas like the U.S. and Europe and in other areas of the world? Jim Williamson : Yes, sure, Brian. It\u2019s Jim again. Yes. So, on the Turkey quake, a couple of things, one, our loss was $70 million for the Turkey quake. And what I would describe to you in terms of that market is we have been a long-term participant in the Turkey cat market. We have earned outstanding returns in that market, similar to the things that we have done in other parts of our portfolio, that were coming in over the last 2 years, we have really significantly reduced our participation in Turkey, primarily in our quota share treaties, which we have cut back significantly. But we are still an XOL player. We have made a lot of money. Even after this event, our profit position is very strong and the return profile is very good. The other thing that I would indicate on that $70 million losses, if you were to compare what happened in Turkey versus what happened, say, in the U.S. in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s an important contrast to point out. That Turkey quake was probably something like a 1 in 50 events. You have 50,000 people killed in Turkey alone, another 10,000 in Syria is a huge human tragedy, our view is that is a real cat loss. And that\u2019s where Everest and its value proposition is meant to be called to help that country recover. And I would contrast that with the U.S. storms in the first quarter, which really, in our view, should be an attritional event for the primary market. And you saw that play out in our portfolio. So, that gives you a sense of how we are playing those dynamics and really focusing on leveraging our capacity, we are getting high return and also where you have actual cat losses. Brian Meredith : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : I think Juan, you touched upon this a little bit with reinsurance, but I was wondering if you could talk about how, I guess from the conditions our expected returns are evolving in the international insurance market? Juan Andrade : Say that again, Meyer, please. Meyer Shields : I am trying to get a sense of \u2013 look, I think that has a great sense of what\u2019s going on in property, but for other lines in insurance, I am not sure I have a great handle on the opportunity that you are seeing there in terms of how expected returns are evolving. Juan Andrade : Yes, absolutely. I am happy to start and then I will ask Mike Karmilowicz to jump in. Look, I think there is a few dynamics to keep in mind in international markets. By definition, they tend to be more short-tailed in nature. So, that means that they are going to carry lower ELRs than what we have in North America because of our long tail focus in North America traditionally. So, I think that\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind. When we look at the broad trends though, we see pricing actually to be quite good in places like Europe, Latin America and Asia for that short tail business. And so for us, that remains pretty attractive. And as we were saying earlier, I said in my prepared remarks, one of the great things that we are building right now is really a very diversified global insurance company by geography, by product line and by distribution wholesale retail, which enables us to play and deploy capital where we find the most attractive areas. So, for example, in the U.S. in the quarter, when we see public D&O and maybe workers\u2019 compensation, not as attractive as other lines of business, we can move away from those lines, be cautious as I have said, and deploy that capital into other lines of business, which could be again, short tail property in Europe or in Latin America or even within the U.S., given what I said earlier. But that gives us a sense of how we manage the portfolio to get the most economic benefit for the company. Mike Karmilowicz : Yes. And I think, Meyer, I would just add a comment on the short tail piece. Not only are we seeing the opportunity within property, but also within marine and aviation businesses as well, given our nature of some of these lines, which we don\u2019t have legacy issue too, particularly for marine and for specifically aviation. We have tremendous upside. We have hired great talent. We have got good teams that have great people and capabilities to Juan\u2019s point. And given what\u2019s happening in the reinsurance market, you think on the short-tail lines, you are just now starting to begin to see that rate environment starting to play through with just giving us ample opportunity to be able to capitalize on the marketplace right now. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then one small follow-up, and I may be trying too hard. But I think both Juan and Mark reaffirmed the 91% to 93% in insurance for this year\u2019s combined ratio, so I was hoping you could update us on the reinsurance side? Mark Kociancic : Yes. Meyer, it\u2019s Mark. Good morning. So look, on the reinsurance side, we have got a great rate environment right now. And I think Jim articulated a lot of the points that are behind that. We have clearly got loss experience, supply-demand factors impacting capacity, and our Q1 results are really demonstrating some solid growth. And our reinsurance franchise is very scalable, so we are able to take advantage of that. I think the rate is well established. We define that quite a bit in our press release and in our opening remarks. And you are going to see property I think, become a larger component of our combined ratio over time, we are still using prudent loss picks no matter what, because you do have the loss experience of the past cannot go down to the bottom line that quickly, but it is shorter sale business on the property side. So, we would expect to realize margin notwithstanding the loss experience of the current year over time. So, I think what we have got is fairly meaningful strength underpinning our combined ratio going forward. So, as you see the net earnings earning out with the increase of 2023 premiums, whether it\u2019s the pro rata side or the excess of loss with this strong rate environment, the shift towards more property versus casualty and the combined ratio. I think you will see improvements in the combined ratio within reinsurance specifically. And we definitely see the margin expansion through the renewals, and we know that\u2019s going to filter down through the combined ratio over time. So, I see this combined ratio question kind of solving itself through actual results in the coming quarters on an improved basis. Juan Andrade : Meyer, I would add just to Mark because I think that was well said. This is one. And I would repeat what I said to Elyse earlier in the call is that our combined ratio should continue to improve on the strength of the rate improved terms, mix of business, everything that Mark was talking about. And you look at the combined ratio that reinsurance had in this quarter, and I think that gives you a starting point. Meyer Shields : Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question today is a follow-up from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. I just want to ask a follow-up on the earning of the pro rata premiums and reinsurance over a 2-year period. I thought it would be 1 year. Is there a multi-year treaty component there, or is that just how pro rata is earned? I guess it\u2019s a bit new to me. Mark Kociancic : Yaron, it\u2019s Mark speaking. So, it\u2019s a standard accounting convention to earn pro rata on what\u2019s called an 8s basis, so over an eight-quarter period of time. And it\u2019s not a multiyear treaty. It\u2019s definitely a 1-year treaty, but your cedents are obviously producing business throughout the year, so they could produce premium, for example, in December, and it takes time to earn that out. So, the premium recognition or earnings is really standard in the business for pro rata and it\u2019s earned on an 8s basis. And in the first quarter, without getting too technical, you have kind of a slow ramp-up because you would essentially start that earnings really at the midpoint of the first quarter, the 45th day of a 90-day quarter and then it ramps up over time throughout this eight-quarter period. And so you have got last year\u2019s pro rata, whether it\u2019s property or casualty, still learning into the \u201823 earned, for example, you got the \u201823 writings earning out. And so that shift will occur through the year, combined with whatever the loss picks are and the weighting for those specific segments. Yaron Kinar : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one other follow-up, if I may. I think you called out some timing issues with expenses. When do you expect that to normalize? Mark Kociancic : Well, I will break it into two parts, so corporate and underwriting. So, on the corporate side, look, we have two components. The largest of which is really interest expense. We have a meaningful component of floating rate debt through the FHLB and then a floating rate sub debt and that\u2019s based on three-month sulfur. And so that increased, I would say, roughly $3 million a quarter on the run rate versus, say, Q1 of last year. I think that stabilizes for \u201823. It\u2019s difficult to see sulfur moving that much this year. So, I think what you see in Q1 will hold for the remaining of the year, potentially go down if sulfur goes down. Corporate expenses, I think last year\u2019s run rate of approximately $16 million a quarter is a pretty good run rate for this year. So, I see pretty good stability, generally speaking, for the corporate side. On the underwriting, two pieces, reinsurance, insurance. So, I think on the reinsurance side, we feel good about our expense ratio in general, you see a slightly elevated number in Q1 really for platform expenses for the most part. But I think somewhere in the 2.6%, 2.7% expense ratio type area is a good number for reinsurance in 2023. On the insurance side, we see that elevating a bit into the mid-15% area. We started off the year at a 15.9%, and I think that\u2019s a combination of two things talent acquisition and then a bit on the platform expense as we are building out and scaling our operations in internationally and also domestically, but we are adding meaningful talent, especially at a senior level globally within the insurance franchise. So, I think that will pay off over time, but you do pay for it early on in terms of the expense load. I would point out a couple of things. So one, we feel \u2013 we still feel very good about the technical ratio and insurance profitability that\u2019s coming in from the commission and ELRs on that standpoint. And hence, my comments in the prepared remarks of affirming our assumption of 91% and 93% combined for the insurance division as a whole. So, we see a bit of a mix here in terms of elevated underwriting expense, but still good on 91% and 93% based on sound fundamentals of diversified businesses and the good margin that we are seeing in that business. And I think you will also see a pretty good growth rate in the \u2013 for the remainder of the year. Typically, we start seasonally with a lower production in Q1 for insurance, and then it tends to ramp up Q2, Q4, in particular. So, we do feel that there will be some economies of scale occurring as the division grows even more. Yaron Kinar : Thanks for taking my additional question and for the comprehensive color. Operator : And our next question is a follow-up from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning again. So, I want to go back also to the reinsurance discussion. I appreciate right that you guys are saying some of these contracts are going to take a couple of years to earn in. But maybe asking it in a different way, you guys printed a 58% underlying loss ratio in the first quarter. When this business is fully earned in, and we see the full impact of the rate increases in your financials, what can that 58%, what can that number drop to? Mark Kociancic : That\u2019s \u2013 look, Elyse, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a difficult question to answer. Let me frame it with a few of the components that will be taken into consideration. So, I mentioned to you the composition of the business itself. So we do see property coming in stronger. And I think both Juan and Jim really articulated the level of rate increase that we are seeing. I think the growth is self-evident. You are seeing very strong rate. Jim is talking about risk-adjusted returns that are significantly higher. So, we believe the margins there are superior, really, really good. On the flip side, you are still seeing significant casualty growth, especially on the pro rata, and we are using prudent loss picks there because we are in an elevated risk environment. We are getting paid to take that risk. And so you got a mix of business that is still meaningfully impacted by casualty. And so those are the kind of factors that mix and then the rate itself, which we feel good about, that are going to determine that over time, not to mention whatever the loss experience. But again, the fundamentals are great. This is truly a generational hard market, in particular. For reinsurance property, we are just getting started. We love our positioning and the ability of our franchise, how we are globally positioned to take advantage of it and really be selective and adding value to our clients in this process. So, I think that combined ratio will solve itself based on the sound fundamentals. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my \u2013 one other for me, your PMLs, given your expectations for what you expect could transpire at midyear, it sounds like you guys are still pretty positive about the reinsurance pricing environment, where would you expect your PMLs to trend once we get through the June and July 1, catastrophe reinsurance renewals? Jim Williamson : Sure, Elyse. This is Jim Williamson, great question. So, first of all, we do see tremendous opportunity, and we are leaning into that, and we have selectively deployed incremental capacity, always within the defined appetite of the group, and we have talked a number of times about our willingness to put both our earnings and capital at risk, and we have plenty of room within that defined appetite to maneuver, and that\u2019s certainly what we have been doing. The other thing that I would say that\u2019s a repeat of what you have heard from me in the past, but we always start with creating our own capacity. In any portfolio, there is good, better and best deals. And I can tell you the good deals are not getting capacity anymore. It\u2019s really moving to the best deals. And so what that\u2019s allowed us to do is selectively expand available capacity. What does that mean, that means gross PMLs go up modestly. It wasn\u2019t a huge move, as you saw 1/1 when we printed our PMLs. I expect that trend to kind of play out through the rest of this year. As I indicated earlier, if 6/1 meets our expectations for pricing and terms, I expect total capacity deployed to be consistent with last year, which I think will produce meaningful increases in premium even more meaningful increases in expected profit, very modest or no real change in PMLs. And then as you roll through the rest of the year, I would expect, again, modest increases in gross PMLs, with even larger increases in premium and profit. So, that should give you a view. I don\u2019t expect a wild move on the PMLs by any stretch of the imagination. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today\u2019s final question is a follow-up from Mike Zaremski at BMO. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Great. Just one quick one. Just kind of thinking through the bullish outlook, generational hard market that term was used dislocation. Just curious, is there \u2013 would there be a scenario in the cards where Everest would want to opportunistically raise capital? The debt capital was \u2013 levels were increased last year, which looks like a great move, just curious if there is any scenarios in which equity capital need to be raised as well. Mark Kociancic : Mike, it\u2019s Mark. So look, we feel very good about our positioning in this market, our ability to execute our plan. We have got the franchise on a global basis. We are a leading reinsurance market. So, I think the platform is clearly well demonstrated to meet this opportunity. We have got a lot of financial flexibility, and I will just leave it that we are always exploring and evaluating our market opportunities and our capital structure to make it better. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Thank you, and thank you all for being with us today. I think as you can see, our operating performance was excellent in the first quarter. We are off to a strong start, and we are on offense. You have heard some of our commentary here regarding the market and regarding the bullishness. The momentum is strong and our ambitions were high. We are building on our first quarter momentum to continue delivering exceptional value for all of our stakeholders. So, with that, I thank you for your questions, for your time and for the support of the company, and we will see you soon at our second quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest second quarter performance was outstanding. We grew the business at significantly expanded margins, taking full advantage of the hard reinsurance market and delivered industry-leading returns, including a near 22% operating return on equity and a record annualized 25% total shareholder return. We have strong momentum across the board. Capitalizing on the hard market opportunity in reinsurance, which continues globally, and both underwriting businesses continue to benefit from the global flight to quality amidst excellent and persistent market conditions. In addition, our superb execution drove strong results in the June and July reinsurance renewals. We continue to invest in our primary insurance business, which is also benefiting from similar tailwinds with favorable pricing across a number of business lines. In May, we completed our successful $1.5 billion equity base. The response from the market was excellent and validates the opportunity we see before us. We remain proactive and nimble with our capital deployment, and we are on track to fully deploy the capital raised by the January 1, 2024 renewal. We changed our official company name and stock ticker symbol during the quarter. This was another key milestone. Our updated Everest Group name with our newly branded ticker symbol, EG, is a testament about our hybrid strategy and steadfast commitment to global reinsurance and insurance. As we approach the back half of the year, our talent, underwriting discipline, and capital position give us significant firepower to achieve our objectives and drive superior returns. With that, I\u2019ll turn to our second quarter financial highlights, beginning at the group level. All of our group key financial metrics improved and included quarterly records for both operating income and total shareholder return. Growth was broad and diversified. We continue to see excellent opportunities for further expansion across our portfolio. We grew gross written premiums by 22% year-over-year in constant dollars, led by exceptional reinsurance growth, which hit a new written premium record. Net operating income increased to an all-time high of $627 million, up more than 62% year-over-year. This was supported by underwriting profits in excess of $400 million. The group combined ratio improved 410 basis points year-over-year to 87.7%. This is an excellent result, especially considering this is projected to be the worst second quarter for U.S. catastrophe losses since 2011. Everest net catastrophe loss was just $27.2 million. Additionally, our investment portfolio performed well, producing $357 million in net investment income, a significant improvement from the prior year. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Second quarter reinsurance results were also excellent. They are a product of our lead market position, breadth of offering and outstanding execution by our team. We grew our portfolio and we expanded margins. The Property Cat pricing remained strong, and the 2023 hard market has now surpassed the post-hurricane Andrew market. This provided the backdrop for excellent mid-year renewals. June 1 renewal, centered on the Florida market, was very strong with prospective returns exceeding the January 1st renewal. This momentum persisted into the July 1 renewals. Pricing was up sharply in key markets around the world. For example, the Australian market underwent a complete restructuring, moving away from frequency covers to true catastrophe structures. Everest is the preferred market by many of our customers. And as I noted earlier, we continue to benefit from a flight to quality around the globe. We were able to deploy additional capacity to many of our core clients at attractive returns. Gross premiums for the quarter were up 27% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant dollar basis, $2.8 billion. As I noted earlier, this is a record for the division. Growth was widespread across business lines and geographies. Property Cat premiums were up 30% from last year. Along with casualty and property pro rata premiums at 16% and 35%, respectively. We also grew in specialty lines, including marine and aviation. International growth was strong, particularly in Asia, where we nimbly took share in dislocated markets like South Korea. Pretax catastrophe losses were modest despite the active cap order for the industry. Our deliberate initiatives to shape the portfolio and manage volatility continue to improve our results. We nearly doubled our underwriting profit to $337 million, equating to a combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.9% improvement year-over-year. Approximately 90% of our portfolio now renewed in 2023 at significantly improved rates and terms, we enter the second half of the year well positioned and our outlook for the January 1, 2024 renewal is positive. Turning to insurance. We made strong progress in advancing our global insurance business. We grew the segment more than 14% in constant dollars, generating a record $1.4 billion in premiums. Growth was broad and diversified, both geographically and by product line, particularly strong in property, both domestically and international as well as in specialty lines like marine, aviation and energy. We maintained our disciplined approach to managing and diversifying the portfolio, reducing our exposure in lines where the market is not well priced, like monoline workers\u2019 compensation and public company D&O. While it\u2019s still early days, we are also gaining traction in international markets where we are methodically expanding our capabilities and local expertise. Market response has been excellent. Reinforcing the abundant global opportunity that we see. In aggregate, rate continues to exceed trend across our core portfolio. We achieved a double-digit rate increase, excluding workers\u2019 compensation and financial lines. Group pricing was particularly noteworthy in property, marine and other specialty lines. The heart of reinsurance market contributed to positive pricing in the primary market. This, coupled with persistent industry cat losses and a heightened risk environment supports continued favorable pricing in insurance. Despite severe weather in the U.S., our cat losses were de minimis and reflect our consistent proactive portfolio management and our focus on superior risk-adjusted returns. The enhancements we have made to augment our technology and streamline our infrastructure are yielding greater efficiencies and connectivity across our platform. Everything from claims to distribution is being scaled methodically around client needs, allowing us to remain agile and responsive as we grow. I\u2019m proud of Everest\u2019s performance in the second quarter, and our team\u2019s consistent ability to adapt and serve the needs of our clients and deliver leading returns to our shareholders. We have built a long and durable runway to profitably grow our hybrid platform, we\u2019re approaching the market opportunity with full force. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a very strong quarter, rounding out a solid start to the first half of 2023. The company reported record operating income of $627 million or $15.21 per diluted share in the quarter, equating to an operating income ROE of 21.8%. Total shareholder return or TSR stands at 25.3% annualized. We improved our overall combined ratio by more than 400 basis points while generating double-digit growth in constant dollars in both segments as pricing and terms remain attractive in most lines of business around the world. Juan mentioned during May, we completed a successful $1.5 billion public equity offering in the quarter and are on schedule with the deployment of that capital. Company\u2019s strong performance in the second quarter was led by our team\u2019s high level of execution in our core markets, we have a number of tailwinds that are back throughout the remainder of the year and well into 2024. Looking at the group results for the second quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $4.2 billion, representing 22.3% growth in constant dollars year-over-year. The combined ratio was 87.7%, which includes 80 basis points of losses or $27 million from natural catastrophes. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were partially offset by $30 million of catastrophe bond recoveries related to Hurricane Ian. The group attritional loss ratio was 59.4%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year\u2019s quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail in just a moment. Group\u2019s commission ratio improved 50 basis points to 21.1% on mix changes, while the group\u2019s expense ratio was 6.3%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums written grew 26.9% in constant dollars during the quarter. Strong growth came from the continued successful execution of our 2023 renewal strategy. We generated double-digit growth across every line of business. Combined ratio was 85.9%, which improved 600 basis points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 120 basis points to 57.6% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms, which we expect to continue into 2024. The commission ratio was 24.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.6%, which was essentially flat year-over-year. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 14.1% in constant dollars to a quarterly premium volume record of $1.4 billion. Growth was primarily driven by property and specialty lines in the quarter as pricing gained additional momentum. Overall, pricing remains ahead of loss trend, as Juan mentioned. Combined ratio was 92.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The division benefited from zero natural catastrophe losses in the quarter further demonstrating the success of our derisking actions on our portfolio. The attritional loss ratio was modestly higher this quarter at 64.4%, driven by business mix and one-off premium adjustments in our Lloyd\u2019s syndicate. Commission ratio improved 100 basis points, largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of ceding commissions and decreased gross commissions across multiple lines. The underwriting related expense ratio was 16.5%, largely driven by certain one-off expenses and continued investment in global systems in our platform. We expect the expense ratio to diminish over the course of the year. And finally, to cover investments, tax in the balance sheet. Net investment income increased $131 million to $357 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher new money yields, our investment in floating rate securities and higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $59 million of net investment income, a sequential improvement as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 2.8% to 3.9% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 2.9 years. And as a reminder, the 22% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the second quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 11.5%, in line with our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year. Shareholders\u2019 equity ended the quarter at $10.9 billion or $12.5 billion, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities. At the end of the quarter, unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio equate to approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of $167 million as compared to the end of the first quarter resulting from increases in rates at the front end of the curve. Cash flow from operations was strong at approximately $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $251.17, an improvement of 18.1% from year-end 2022 when adjusted for dividends of $3.30 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding unrealized depreciation and depreciation of securities stood at $288.64 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 11.4%. Net leverage at quarter-end stood at 19.1% modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent second quarter of 2023 and is well positioned heading into the back half of the year and 2024. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Matt. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow up, then rejoin the queue for any additional questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping you could just walk us through your plans on putting the $1.5 billion of equity you guys raised to work. I know, Mark, you said you guys are on schedule deployment of the capital. Can you just give us a sense, expand upon that and give us a sense of the split that you see between property and casualty reinsurance writings as well as the expected ROE on the deployed capital. Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Elyse. This is Juan. So let me get started, and I\u2019ll ask then Jim to join in and provide a lot more granularity to you on that topic. But as both Mark and I said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re very much on track to fully deploy the capital by the January 1, 2024 renewal. As you saw from the numbers, we drove meaningful growth not only in the quarter but also during the July 1 renewal. But in addition to the key renewal dates, and Jim will talk a little bit more about this in detail, we have also done a number of private or closely placed opportunities at excellent rates and terms that have also emerged outside of the renewal period. So we continue to see plenty of opportunity. We don\u2019t see any change in the market, and we\u2019re very much on track with the deployment. But now let me ask Jim to go a little bit deeper on that. James Williamson : Sure. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And I\u2019m going to be a little expansive here because I do think this is connected to a number of critical trends within the business. I mean, first, to take you back to a little bit of what we said on the last quarter\u2019s call around how we expected this to play out, we sort of laid out, look, this capital deployment really begins with the 7/1 renewal, which is for us about $1 billion of expiring premium. It would continue through the end of 2023, where you\u2019ve got about another $1 billion of premium. And then it would complete at the Jan 1 renewal, which, at this point, our expiring book will be somewhere on the order of $6 billion. And that proportionality would account for the capital deployment. And that\u2019s playing out as we expected. In fact, I would add to that, that we did have some opportunities in a very targeted way outside of Florida, but at the 6/1 renewal to take meaningfully increased lines with some of our core cedents, which were very attractive. That continued into 7/1. We grew strongly at that renewal and we did it at excellent rate. In fact, if you look at the rate we printed for North America in the second quarter of [\u201847], we actually exceeded that in many cases for the June and July renewals. So we feel really good about that. And then as Juan had indicated, we participated on a number of private or closely brokered placements, and there\u2019s a variety of things in there, whether it\u2019s a large layer on top of the Cat program for a global cedent down to fact placements to deal with sort of dislocated single risks and everything in between. And so we\u2019re on our front feet that way and taking advantage of those opportunities as they come to us. And I would also add, obviously, I\u2019m focusing here on property Cat, but we\u2019ve also taken advantage of trends in casualty where we continue to grow in some of the specialty lines. And one example I would cite in the second quarter is our aviation book, which on the back of really incredible rate change was up over 50% year-over-year at again, terrific economics. And so as we\u2019ve executed this, we\u2019ve been focused on a number of key priorities. And before you even really talk about growth, it\u2019s portfolio quality. And so all the things that we\u2019ve mentioned in our last call continue to play out. Attachment points are going up. Our average attachment point is moving further out in the curve. And certainly, you saw proof of that in our second quarter Cat print, which was simply outstanding. You saw us adjust our portfolio in Florida. A number of the Demotech rated Florida specialists, frankly, did not pass our financial underwriting standards, and we moved away from them and redeploy the capital elsewhere. So we are nimble that way, and we\u2019re as focused on portfolio quality as we are on top line, even more so. And the other thing I would say in terms of priorities is over 90% of the incremental capacity that we\u2019ve deployed has been with our existing clients. These are people we know well and people who we play with across a wide variety of lines. And so that incremental Cat capacity not only is a tremendous opportunity in itself, it also further strengthens our core relationships. And so as you play all that forward to Jan 1, our expectation is that we\u2019ll be confronted with just excellent prospective returns at the renewal. Why do we believe that? Pretty fundamental stuff. The first is that the supply-demand imbalance that\u2019s been playing out in the reinsurance market hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed. And we\u2019ve certainly seen analysis that suggests there\u2019s still a very meaningful gap between supply and demand. And I would posit to you that demand is pent-up and growing rapidly. And that\u2019s because I think many scenes weren\u2019t able to complete their queue. There are 1/1 placements the way they wanted to. They\u2019re facing a risk environment that\u2019s not getting any easier, climate change being at the front of that line, but also inflation, geopolitics and other factors. And then obviously, while we had a terrific second quarter in Cats, many primary underwriters did not. In fact, it\u2019s a record level or near record level of second quarter Cat activity, particularly in the United States, but also in other markets around the world. So a really tough spot to be in as a primary underwriter and that\u2019s increasing their demand for reinsurance. We\u2019ve also seen no capital formation of any meaningful extent, obviously, putting our capital raise aside and I\u2019ve heard of nothing meaningful in the pipeline that\u2019s going to really change that. The other factor that I think is important is if you go back to 1/1, many of the panels that got put in place particularly for the global cedents, included a number of reinsurers that frankly, I think they\u2019d rather not be trading with very extensively. And as Juan had mentioned in his opening remarks, there is a global flight to quality happening, and we think we\u2019ll continue to benefit from that at 1/1, where we\u2019ll have an opportunity to help our clients clean up those panels with a much higher quality underwriter. And then the last piece that I\u2019ll cite, and I think it\u2019s important, it\u2019s a little harder to quantify or maybe impossible, but there\u2019s an underwriter psychology component at play, which is there\u2019s a reason this market hardened and it\u2019s because underwriters have taken a number of years of Cat losses. And I haven\u2019t met anybody in this industry who because they may have some additional capital coming into 1/1 wants to trade down or auction down pricing in property Cat. That\u2019s just \u2013 that is not the mentality that exists in our industry. So our expectation going into 1/1 is that we\u2019re going to push hard for increased rates. We think the industry should be pushing hard for more given the experience we\u2019ve had in all those external factors we talked about. We\u2019re going to be looking to grow not just property Cat, which we will grow meaningfully, but casualty, specialty and a number of other areas. We are globally diversified, so we can drive growth in multiple regions. We\u2019re also diversified by line, so we can grow Cat, non-Cat property specialty, you name it. And we fully expect that we will complete the deployment of the incremental capital at the 1/1 renewal at outstanding terms. So hopefully, that gives you the color you\u2019re looking for. Mark Kociancic : Elyse, it\u2019s Mark. I just want to add a few points to Jim\u2019s comments and once we get some of the specifics you were asking earlier, we still see greater than 90% of this capital raise deployment this year going into the reinsurance division. That\u2019s the lion\u2019s share. That\u2019s where we have a very strong an exceptionally strong franchise and underlying fundamentals that Jim just walked through that really gives us the confidence, especially coming out of the 7/1s, our conviction just couldn\u2019t be stronger at that capital raise will be put to good use. I do expect the property casualty mix to swing a bit more single digits into favor with property lines or property premium moving forwards. And I think you\u2019re seeing some of that evolution in our financial supplement. And again, the ROE on that incremental $1.5 billion of capital is something we feel confident in exceeding our Q1 operating ROE going forwards. Elyse Greenspan : That\u2019s helpful, and thanks for the all the color. My follow-up, we\u2019ve been \u2013 there\u2019s been headlines on surrounding collateralized casualty reinsurance. And I was wondering if you guys are seeing cedents looking to replace covers with high-quality reinsurers like yourselves? Or if this is something that you\u2019re expecting we could start to see play out in the market? James Williamson : Yes. Elyse, this is Jim again. Yes, we \u2013 look, we are definitely hearing a lot of chatter around the topic, particularly given some recent events, and you\u2019ve seen some dislocation in a variety of parts, particularly in the fronting market. And look, what I would say to that is obviously, we\u2019re opportunistic. We have the flexibility if there\u2019s an interesting opportunity that emerges, that gives us an opportunity to earn great returns. We certainly take it. But our priority remains building franchise positions with the best global underwriters over time. And that means that\u2019s where our focus is, and we don\u2019t get distracted by some of the noise that might exist around a particular opportunity even though we are ready to lean into it, should those opportunities come our way. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Elyse. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Maybe a follow-up on the last line of questions. We did hear some commentary yesterday from a couple of your competitors, one thing that they believe that property Cat rates were now adequate for the industry. And I noticed, Jim, in your response, you said that you\u2019re still looking to push a lot of rate in 1/1. So I guess I\u2019d be interested to hear your views on how adequate pricing or rates are today? Or if it\u2019s just a matter of really just keeping up with loss trends going forward? And then the other comment we heard yesterday was a preference by one of your competitors to really deploy capital and property more into insurance than reinsurance. And clearly, we\u2019re hearing a different tone from you. So I would love to hear how you\u2019re thinking about the two from that perspective. Juan Andrade : Yes, Yaron, this is Juan. So let me go ahead and get started with that. Look, I think from our perspective, we obviously like the returns that we\u2019re getting in property Cat but in general as well. And I fundamentally agree with what Jim said. We will keep pushing for rate terms and structure as we really haven\u2019t seen any fundamental changes in the external environment. I think you\u2019ve seen some of the headline news this morning with one of our competitors reporting that in the first half of the year, Cats were over the 10-year average at over $40 billion. So there\u2019s still an active Cat environment. That hasn\u2019t changed. We also see the general risk environment continue to be very elevated. You\u2019ve got geopolitical issues, you\u2019ve got social inflation, you\u2019ve got all these other things that are out there, that hasn\u2019t changed. And then you also have inflation that comes into the equation, right? There\u2019s an impact on cost of materials, et cetera. So this is why from our perspective, we don\u2019t see a change in the market. And therefore, we\u2019re going to continue to push price, rate, terms and structure. So from my perspective, that is how we think about it. To your second question on insurance and reinsurance and property Cat deployment, we do like the property Cat environment right now in reinsurance. But as you saw in our insurance numbers, we also grew property and insurance by 37% as we reported in the supplement. So we\u2019re leaning into it as well. And frankly, that\u2019s one of the advantages that we have in our hybrid models. We can take advantage of the best risk-adjusted opportunities and move capital pretty nimbly to that. But let me have Jim also add some color on this. James Williamson : Yes, Yaron, thanks for the question. And maybe at the risk of repeating a little bit of what Juan said, but I do think it\u2019s a critical point. The fact is, whether we like it or not, we live in a cyclical industry. And we\u2019ve come through a period of a number of years where Cat pricing wasn\u2019t where it needed to be. Losses were elevated and that hurt a lot of underwriting companies and losses piled up. And so my view is we\u2019re not sitting here saying, \"Okay, we\u2019re going to take rate change until we hit adequacy, declare victory and then just sit there.\" I mean that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to run this business. We want to be earning excellent returns. And you\u2019ve heard me consistently say, starting with the 1/1 renewal in particular, but really even going back to 7/1 of 2022, prospective return profiles are excellent. That does not mean we\u2019re going to sit idly and just accept that. We want to continue to push. It is an elevated risk environment. There is inflation. There is geopolitical challenge. Cat is inherently volatile, and we think reinsurers deserve to get paid for that, and we\u2019re going to continue to push for it. Michael Karmilowicz : And Yaron, this is Mike Karmilowicz. I would just add on the insurance side to the point that Juan made earlier, take into consideration the last couple of years, what we\u2019ve done to really basically go through our portfolio strategy, not just on volatility of muting that, but actually looking specifically at how we can actually take our concentration, derisk that across not just the U.S. but also the opportunity across the globe. So we basically have lowered our gross limits over the last two years by over 41%. In addition to that, lowered our PMLs, premium to PML ratio is dramatically the 1 in 100 to take that into consideration of what\u2019s given us the opportunity and the capacity to the point Jim just said, we\u2019re leaning in very heavy seeing very meaningful returns with average rate increases of over 30% when you add an exposure change you\u2019re talking premium change of over 40%. So we think the market is really robust. We see really good opportunity not just domestically, but internationally with a really good strategy to derisk and keep our concentration limited in a lot of pockets in both peak and non-peak areas, which I think just bodes well for us going into \u201823 and \u201824. Yaron Kinar : Thanks for a very comprehensive answer. And then maybe if we continue with you, Mike, and I apologize for nitpicking here on a very good quarter. But one thing that did stand out was the 170 basis point deterioration in the underlying loss ratio in insurance. I know Mark called out some premium adjustments and mix shift. But could you maybe give us a little more color there and quantify some of the EBIT changes? Mark Kociancic : Yaron, it\u2019s Mark. Maybe I can start. So a couple of components. Like I said in my scripted remarks, the premium adjustments were \u2013 they were a reasonable size. You\u2019re talking $5 million, $6 million lion\u2019s share coming out of the Lloyd\u2019s syndicate. So that\u2019s flowing through earned premium and altering the ratios mechanically, unfortunate situation, but definitely, we would consider it to be one-off in nature. And then you\u2019ve got a mix of business component. We do see property becoming a much more substantial portion of the earned premium moving forward, so that\u2019s going to help to change the composition of the attritional loss ratio within the combined ratio and you\u2019ll also see, I think, A&H subside in terms of the size of its contribution to the combined ratio and the dynamics it brings in terms of expected loss ratio and expense within there. So this is something that should mechanically move towards a lower attritional loss ratio moving forward. Juan Andrade : And what I would emphasize, too, Yaron, this is one is, as Mark was saying, the uptick was really from one-time and non-recurring adjustments. And just to emphasize his last point is, as we continue to write more property at excellent prices and you heard the numbers being quoted by Mike, and as we write, frankly, more specialty products, too, which we also \u2013 we saw the growth in other specialty in the quarter of over 39% like aviation and marine, energy, et cetera, all of that is going to have a very positive impact on the loss ratios it earns in during subsequent quarters. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Ward with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe a somewhat similar question, but for reinsurance. Just curious if you could talk about the pace of underlying margin improvement from here? James Williamson : Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Look, I\u2019d say if you look at the improvement in the current quarter, that\u2019s really driven by two factors. One, we have selected a lower current accident year attritional loss ratio for our Cat portfolio based mostly on our experience. So just in prior years, we\u2019ve outperformed that pick. And so we reduced it. Obviously, I expect a tailwind from all the rate we\u2019re getting to continue to improve that pick over time. So that would be a factor. And then the second factor is really the beginning of a mix shift toward property from casualty, not because we are not growing casualty, you saw we continue to do that in Q2 at a slightly lower rate, but that property growth has picked up and we\u2019ll continue to earn through the portfolio. So all those tailwinds that I described will continue. In particular, you\u2019re really just really at the beginning of earning through all of these positive impacts. So really positive that way. And I know you\u2019re talking loss ratio, but while we\u2019re talking margin, the other tailwind I would describe is around commission. You did see a little bit of commission improvement in the quarter, which obviously a good thing, which we welcome. That was driven almost entirely by mix. So that\u2019s a mix shift toward property and this property mix on the earned premium side increases, that will continue. The piece that you\u2019re really not even seeing yet, but you will see is the fact that casualty seating commissions have been coming down. We\u2019ve seen that pretty consistently starting with 1/1, and it\u2019s really just beginning to earn into the portfolio. So a tailwind there. So the bottom line is, we expect some really good trends in terms of total margin. Michael Ward : Thanks. Really helpful. And then so I guess, net investment income was pretty strong, including ops for the quarter. Just wondering if you have any outlook for the second half of the year. Mark Kociancic : Mike, it\u2019s Mark. So a couple of points to make here. I\u2019ll split it between the interest income component and then the ops performance. I think the interest income has got very good momentum. We\u2019ve taken advantage of structuring our portfolio taking into account the short end of the yield curve. And so you\u2019re seeing those floating rate securities that we speak about frequently, really pay off in terms of the resets and the higher yield that is generated from those securities. So I see a strong tailwind there. You\u2019re seeing our book yield rise year-over-year. We\u2019re clearly investing well north of a 5% new money rate on a global basis. And the AUM, I think, is churning north even beyond the equity raise contribution. We\u2019re getting some nice pickup on that. So feel very good. I think the credit quality of the portfolio is quite strong. We\u2019re really at the north end of an A+ average credit quality on the fixed income portfolio bordering a AA-, but \u2013 so that\u2019s important as we contemplate credit adequacy in the portfolio. And the op performance is something we\u2019re very pleased with. It\u2019s difficult to forecast, but we\u2019ve got a broadly diversified set of investments there on the private equity side for the most part. And that is expected to give us a nice stable \u2013 relatively stable distribution given the diversification of over 200 limited partnerships. Now it\u2019s somewhat cyclical in terms of how that contribution comes in, but generally correlates well with where the S&P 500 is coming in over time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing any kind of one-off type contribution in the quarterly performance for Q2, but rather you\u2019re seeing a broad-based support from the ops in the income. Michael Ward : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from C. Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess I had one macro question and then one more detailed question. On a macro basis, can you just speak and I know you\u2019ve spoken, talked about the hard property market. Can you talk about your perspectives on the facultative portion of the market versus the treaty portion of the market. I really don\u2019t hear a lot of commentary, but I believe you\u2019re pretty active in the facultative side, too. Juan Andrade : Yes, Greg, this is Juan Andrade. Look, facultative has seen some very strong growth as well. And it\u2019s frankly for the same reasons that we\u2019ve been talking about, right? Basically, cedents are looking for opportunities to upload, if you will, some of the risk that does necessarily fit into their treaty structure. So from our perspective, our global fac book right now is also growing pretty significantly. We feel very good about that as well. But Jim, maybe you can add some specific color. James Williamson : Yes, Greg, thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s an astute one because as we mentioned, it\u2019s a tough environment for our cedents and they\u2019re looking to manage risk. And if their treaty attachments have gone up, they\u2019re looking at their pre-risk exposures and their concerns. So they turn to the fac market. We grew our fac portfolio in the second quarter by almost 40%. Based on those trends, with a real emphasis on property as well as some segments of casualty and specialty lines. What I would add to that is very similar to what you\u2019ll hear us say about our insurance property business. The same factors are playing out in facultative in terms of our approach to underwriting. We\u2019re controlling limits deployed, so keeping limits very tight, focused on quality risk selection and ensuring that we\u2019re getting paid extremely well for the risks we\u2019re taking. And I would say, similar again to primary insurance market. The fac rate taking has really accelerated steeply, particularly as our competitors are dealing with their own reinsurance costs. So we view it as a nice opportunity. Gregory Peters : Makes sense. I wanted to pivot to the insurance operations as my second and follow-up question. When I look at some of the lines of business, accident, health maybe not so much, but specialty casualty, professional liability, workers\u2019 comp. We\u2019re observing other primary companies report some volatility around prior year development and really not seeing that out of you guys. So maybe you could spend a minute and just update us on sort of the give and takes out of some of the older accident years inside your book and how the reserves are developing? Mark Kociancic : Yes. So Greg, it\u2019s Mark here. A few points to make. Look, the social inflation and the pressure that you\u2019re seeing in the industry from \u201816 to \u201819 is real. That\u2019s something that comes through in the reserve studies. A few points about our portfolio. Last year, we had pluses and minuses in our insurance reserves. We had very modest movements, I\u2019d say, in those specific years for longer tail lines, the casualty lines. And we also had positive offsets coming from some shorter tail lines, workers\u2019 comp as well, et cetera. And so one of the points to make here is that we do have a broad-based portfolio that allows for pluses and minuses over the course of time. We also benefit from a couple of things. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 since 2020 when Juan started, I\u2019d say the prudency of our loss picks has been quite good. We try to be conservative, particularly on the longer tail lines, and we want to hold those picks until we have quite a bit of certainty. And so that conservatism, I think, is helpful when you\u2019ve got this level of uncertainty in the marketplace. And then I think the proportion of the business that we wrote in 2020, 2021 and onwards, particularly in insurance, is significantly larger than the set of reserves that we have for, say, \u201816 to \u201819. So the kind of relative scale is really quite meaningful. And one of the reasons that\u2019s important is you really saw rate take off pretty much, I would say, it probably started more Q4 2019 and has been compounding throughout those quarters since that time. And so that, I think, helps the equation. And then overall, we\u2019re obviously vigilant in how we track rate versus loss trends and the margin there in over time, and we make adjustments as needed in the ELRs, in the reserves and so forth. And so that\u2019s what gets us comfortable with where we are. Gregory Peters : Fair enough. Thanks for the answers. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks. Maybe touching on that subject. We see, I think, in your numbers on the paid to incurred levels ex Cat and PYD that they\u2019re creeping up a bit, but still well below I guess, pre-pandemic ratios. So are you kind of broadly seeing? I know there\u2019s \u2013 it might be tough to paint a broad brush. But are you seeing a bit of a inching up in loss cost inflation, maybe ex property Cat again that\u2019s a different discussion. Mark Kociancic : Yes, that Mike, it\u2019s Mark again here. That\u2019s definitely a concern, a trend. You have different levels of inflation. So whether it\u2019s obviously, the social inflation, I think, is well understood. Then you\u2019ve got excess, what I would call, excess inflation driven by CPI or certain segments, medical loss inflation, wage inflation, depending on which lines all of this pertains to. And so those are things that we monitor. Clearly, there\u2019s an elevated risk environment as we\u2019ve seen some of these increase, in other words, more moderately. So it\u2019s something we take into account with loss picks setting and the monitoring of rate adequacy. But again, I would reiterate the excess of rate versus loss trend. Juan Andrade : Yes. Let me jump in there, Mike. This is Juan because I think that\u2019s a very interesting point. And to build on what I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of this call, we are ahead of trend in a very comfortable way, right? So for instance, our insurance rate level when you take out comp and financial lines, which are really not core to us right now, we increased rate by over 12%. And loss trend for us in insurance on an aggregate basis is significantly lower than that. And then you can leverage on exposure on top of that. And that gives you a pretty good level of comfort on how far ahead of that we are, which basically means you\u2019re building margins. So obviously, we look at loss trends on a very frequent basis, as I\u2019ve mentioned on other calls in the past. We keep very close track of it. But we are comfortably ahead of trend right now with rate and then you add exposure on that, that gives you another buffer. Michael Zaremski : Got it. I guess we\u2019ve \u2013 I think most investors feel comfortable that what you\u2019re saying is happening. It\u2019s just we\u2019re not yet really seeing much reserve releases from Everest, which that\u2019s not a knock, just so it\u2019s sometimes tough triangulating some of the math. I\u2019m just curious on the pricing environment also kind of excluding property Cat. We\u2019re seeing some conflicting data points like the Marsh McLennan commercial pricing index was kind of flattish sequentially quarter-over-quarter, although, on the other hand, some of the carriers \u2013 larger carriers especially have seen a bit of an acceleration broadly for your portfolio, maybe even more on the pro rata side. Are you \u2013 is pricing changing much sequentially? Juan Andrade : Let me start, Mike, this is Juan, and then I\u2019ll have Jim and Mike Karmilowicz to add a little bit of color. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think the Marsh numbers are global numbers. And so you are going to have variations in those numbers from Latin America, Asia, Europe, et cetera, et cetera. The rate environment that we continue to see is actually quite good. And as I just said a couple of minutes ago, we have seen sequential improvement in pricing in primary insurance and certainly on the reinsurance side of things. So that is the environment that we\u2019re living in right now and that we\u2019re seeing as we trade on a daily basis. But Jim can give you some color on the pro rata\u2019s and then Karm can give you some more color on the primary side. James Williamson : Yes, Mike, it\u2019s Jim. So look, I think in the conversations we\u2019re having with our cedents and the analysis we\u2019re doing at renewals, I think fundamentally, as Juan had indicated, the key trend is that rate is moving in the direction it needs to keep up with loss cost and hold loss ratios in place on that front. And what I would just caution in terms of looking at industry indices as a measure of this is portfolio mix really does matter. And if you look at, in particular, some of the areas of the \"casualty market\" that are under pressure and are not experiencing some of the reacceleration that Juan discussed, things like D&O, or workers\u2019 comp where we have very little exposure. And so that can move an index. But what we\u2019re focused on, obviously, is our own portfolio, and we continue to feel good about where those metrics are heading. Michael Karmilowicz : Yes. And as far from the primary insurance group, I focus on a couple of things. We always stress the importance of cycle management. So when you talk about D&O, which we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year as well as workers\u2019 comp. You\u2019ve seen that as an example, workers\u2019 comp go from what was 27% years ago, now down to on the monoline guaranteed cost down to 4%. And then when you see opportunity where we\u2019re really leaning in besides the property side, the first party, aviation, marine, things that really actually we know we can drive rate to terms and really take advantage of the marketplace. So I think based on Juan\u2019s comments about what we\u2019re seeing not just with rate in itself and the exposure change, I think we see the benefit and we see opportunity, particularly in the foreseeable future. Michael Zaremski : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. A couple of here for you. First one, Jim, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about some of the private transactions top-up deals that you did in the quarter. And are those continuing? And maybe you can kind of give us a sense of if they\u2019re not continuing kind of how that would have benefited your growth. I just don\u2019t want to make sure I\u2019m not for my forward estimates, assuming those are continuing. Maybe they are, I don\u2019t know. Juan Andrade : Sure thing, Brian. Jim? James Williamson : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, look, we\u2019re seeing a variety of types. So to the first part of your question, one of the biggest features, and I think one that points to this pent-up demand for capacity issue is a number of our large global clients have come out into the market either in a closely brokered or in some cases, a private placement situation looking to top up their existing Cat programs. And I think the reality is they would have liked to have bought those top-ups at 1/1. I think they were advised and probably appropriately so by their brokers that wasn\u2019t the time to get that \u2013 try to get that done. And so they waited. We started seeing it really at 4/1 right around that time, and it\u2019s continued and it\u2019s been nice activity. And then at the other end of the spectrum, as I had mentioned earlier, some of this is we have a variety of partners coming to us with even large facultative placements, smaller treaties, et cetera, where they just want to deal with per risk exposures and peak zones and get a little more creative and on how they manage their total risk profile, but still keep the economics acceptable. And so it\u2019s continuing. I would say, though, look, the reality is the bulk of this market, particularly in North America, is an open broker market. The big renewals are driving the bulk of all the results that we\u2019re reporting. I would just view these other transactions is a nice tailwind. I think they\u2019re also more importantly a key indication of what we expect to have happen in the future in terms of supply and demand. And so they\u2019re extremely useful that way. Juan Andrade : Right. I would \u2013 this is Juan. I would amplify that last point that Jim made because this is exactly what we have been saying all along, right? What this really illustrates is the fact that the fundamental macro environment that we\u2019re all operating in has not changed, right? You still have high Cat activity. You have a heightened risk environment and our cedents are looking to also manage earnings volatility. And so therefore, they\u2019re still coming to market to try to figure out a way to do that, while at the same time, they\u2019re also trying to attack the property market on the primary side at the same side. So look, all of these are signs, and I think Jim is exactly right that the demand is still absolutely there and they want to trade with carriers like us, right, highly rated, great quality, et cetera. Brian Meredith : Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then the second question, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of where we are in the international build-out on the insurance business. So looking at operating expense growth is up 20%, call it, a little over 20% year-over-year. Should that continue here for the foreseeable future, just big year-over-year increases as you continue to build that out? And kind of where are we in the process? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thank you, Brian. Look, I think for us, it\u2019s still early days. We really began a very methodical build-out of this strategy really at the beginning of last year. We are now essentially in France, in Germany, in Spain, in Chile, in Singapore and in Australia at this point in time with a couple of other markets coming online later this year. We\u2019re really very excited about the opportunities that we see. And frankly, the market reaction has been phenomenal. I\u2019ve traveled the world over the last two years, as I normally do, meeting with our brokers, our people, our clients, et cetera. And frankly, the reception has been terrific. They love the fact that we have the A+ paper. They like the name of the company. They like the people that they\u2019re trading with because they know us. And so from that perspective, the opportunity set has been there. Part of that methodical build-out has been the systems, the target operating model, the people, the underwriters, et cetera, et cetera. And so all of this is really, frankly, within our expectations. When we think about particularly the expense comment that you\u2019re making. But we do see that beginning to trend down over time, I think as Mark had indicated in last quarter\u2019s call. And we\u2019re doing this in a very disciplined way. We\u2019re managing the expenses. We\u2019re managing the build-out in a very careful way, but we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re seeing. And frankly, the reaction that we\u2019ve had in each of these markets. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks. One introductory question, I guess, Jim, you talked about being more cautious on some of the cedents in Florida. I was hoping you could update us on how you\u2019re thinking about the reforms themselves holding up? In other words, how comfortable you are with the Florida market as long as the individual companies are okay. James Williamson : Yes, Meyer. Thanks for the question. Look, and I\u2019ll kind of break that into two parts. First, would \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you a little bit more about what we did and why and then get to the reforms. So, one of our most important, I think, underwriting screens when dealing with those Florida specialists, particularly the Demotech rated Florida specialist is our financial underwriting. And particularly given the stress these folks have been under over the last couple of years and the experience from last year, just a number of clients that we did business with in the past didn\u2019t pass that screen. A little over 1/3 of our Demotech-rated clients didn\u2019t pass that screen. And so we were just no longer able to support their programs. And so we ended up deploying less capacity to those folks. Now we we\u2019re in a terrific market. So we simply reallocated it to both Florida and non-Florida opportunities. So I think, a really good trade for us overall. In terms of the reforms, look, we think they\u2019re terrific reforms. We think the political class in Florida exercised a lot of fortitude, encouraged to tackle this problem head on. It was absolutely necessary. I think given the fraud and abuse that was happening in the state, it was heading to a place where you were going to have an insurance and reinsurance crisis. So we\u2019re positive on the reforms, but we\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019re folks that make decisions based on facts, and it\u2019s not yet 100% clear how the reforms will play out in loss costs. I don\u2019t expect the plaintiffs bar in that state to simply acquiesce to the reform. And so we need to see that play out. So as the results of the reform reveal themselves in actual loss activity if they show that loss costs are coming down, obviously, that would make us more favorable on the Florida market, all other things being equal. And if that\u2019s not true, obviously, less so. The only other piece I would add to that, though, is the commitment we have to Florida, I think, is the right size. I don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 not necessarily looking for signs to double down on the state either sort of irrespective of what happens. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, and we talked a little bit about sort of broad concern about casualty loss trends. I was hoping you could update us on your appetite for loss portfolio \u2013 writing loss portfolio transfers and how you see demand there evolving? James Williamson : Yes, Meyer, it\u2019s Jim again. Look, it\u2019s an area of the market where we\u2019ve done a few transactions over time. It is really not something we focus on. It\u2019s obviously highly competitive. And you\u2019re typically competing with companies who do not carry the kind of rating and quality balance sheet that Everest has and so that changes their economics. We would rather build strong forward-looking franchises with the best global and local cedents across multiple lines and that\u2019s where the bulk of our effort and focus is on. So I just don\u2019t see that being a big piece of what we do going forward. Meyer Shields : Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. I just had one follow-up on the insurance segment, right? You guys have laid out that 91% to 93% combined ratio target, right, with that financial plan a couple of years ago, obviously, the market is much better today. And I know there were some one-offs this quarter in the Q1 that impacted the reported results. But do you have a sense when given the market dynamics, when we could perhaps see that margin come in towards the lower end of the guided range? Mark Kociancic : Yes. So Elyse, it\u2019s Mark. Look, I think there\u2019s some very good fundamentals that we have on the insurance side. You do have a little bit of noise coming from a few factors. So let me just develop this a little bit. So a few points to make. One, we\u2019ve got a very solid top line premium. And you can see pretty good growth in property more expected. It\u2019s not necessarily translating to the earned right now as some of that\u2019s coming in from our international expansion. And so that\u2019s going to be a driver. And that exacerbates the expenses a bit as we\u2019re putting in some of the foundational pieces for the expansion. But that, no issue there. I think that\u2019s more timing. The key thing is that the business that we\u2019re writing internationally and domestically gives us very good confidence. And so from that standpoint, the mix changing, the expected margin, the growth overall is what I think is going to drive us to that lower end of the range. And I think to add to it even further is really the conscious de-risking that we\u2019ve done on the Cat side for insurance. And so when you take a look at this quarter, for example, a zero print on the Cat loss and a pretty low number in Q1 and some of the tactical changes we\u2019ve made and how we\u2019re constructing our Cat appetite for insurance, that\u2019s another meaningful driver of how we get there. And then maybe the last part, I think you can see this in all the commentary we give written and verbal the cycle management capabilities that we have in the insurance division are quite strong. You\u2019ve got a fairly diversified set of lines of business that allow us to transition into higher-margin lines when the markets are favorable in that respect and minimize other areas that are less favorable. And so I think those pieces are really what\u2019s going to get us to the lower portion of the 91%, 93%. And we\u2019re still quite comfortable with that working assumption that we gave you on the IR Day two years ago. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Juan and Mark for any closing remarks. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion. And I\u2019ll close this call by reiterating the confidence in our strategy and our team, frankly, the exceptional talent that\u2019s driving our execution. We remain no offense and we remain disciplined and opportunistic in this hard market. We have an unwavering focus on creating sustained value for our stakeholders, and that is top of mind. I look forward to seeing all of you again to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matthew Rohrmann, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Ltd. third quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest's third quarter performance was excellent. We delivered outstanding returns, including a near 20% operating return on equity and an annualized total shareholder return of 25%. We are leaning into the hard reinsurance market, where favorable conditions and a flight to quality persist. As a lead reinsurance market and preferred partner, we are taking advantage of strong pricing while deepening our client relationships and expanding our global portfolio at significantly improved risk-adjusted returns. We are positioned for success as we head into the January renewals. We also remain on track for January 2024 for the full deployment of the equity capital raised in May. Our primary insurance business delivered strong underwriting income with a significant year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. And our high-quality investment portfolio continues to support our underwriting performance with outstanding returns. We achieved these results despite another active catastrophe quarter. We tracked over 80 material events globally this quarter, resulting in a 9-month year-to-date industry loss estimated at roughly $93 billion. The industry is on course for another $100 billion loss this year. This reinforces the need for continued underwriting discipline and for additional pricing increases across all lines. As the world becomes increasingly complex, Everest value proposition, it's in greater demand. As you have heard me say before, we are on offense with strong tailwinds across all of our earnings streams, a strong balance sheet and top-tier global talent powering it all. With that, I'll turn to our third quarter financial highlights, beginning at the Group level. In addition to delivering exceptional returns, we drove substantial improvements across our Group key financial metrics, underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income and we delivered record increases in operating cash flow and book value per share. We grew the business at significantly expanded margins. Gross written premiums increased by 23% year-over-year in constant dollars, led by record quarterly reinsurance growth. We generated $613 million in net operating income, a significant year-over-year increase, and we have generated $1.7 billion year-to-date. The Group combined ratio of 91.4% also improved year-over-year by 21 points, which translates to an underwriting profit of over $300 million for the quarter and nearly $1 billion in underwriting profit year-to-date. Our attritional loss and combined ratios both improved by more than a point year-over-year to 59% and 86.5%, respectively. We generated more than $400 million in net investment income in the third quarter and we delivered over $1 billion of net investment income year-to-date. In addition to the improved interest rate environment, this year-over-year improvement was driven by strong returns from both our fixed income and our alternative investments. Turning now to our reinsurance business. The reinsurance division delivered an exceptional quarter with outstanding top and bottom line results and superb execution by our team. Leading into the strength of the market, we maintained our strategy of targeted and nimble capital deployment with core clients, resulting in significant growth across virtually all business lines and geographies at materially improved risk-adjusted returns. We grew gross written premiums on a constant dollar basis and excluding reinstatements, by 33% to $3.2 billion for the quarter. This is a new record for the division. In property catastrophe, where the market remains outstanding, premiums, excluding reinstatements, were up 41% from last year. Property pro rata premiums increased 44%. Casualty pro rata premiums were up as well at 20%, while we carefully manage the casualty market cycle and target best-in-class clients. Internationally, we expanded in key target growth markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We also grew in specialty lines with strong margins, including aviation, marine and mortgage. Despite the active catastrophe quarter, we improved our catastrophe loss ratio significantly year-over-year, reflecting our deliberate and consistent actions to manage volatility. The attritional loss and combined ratios were down year-over-year by 1.6 and almost two points, respectively, with the overall combined ratio improving to 91%. This helped us achieve an underwriting profit of $234 million. Looking ahead, our outlook for the January 1, 2024 renewal remains strong. We fully expect the robust pricing and favorable conditions to continue. And as a lead market, we stand to benefit. Our nimble, creative and collaborative approach allows us to simultaneously improve our economics and strengthen client relationships. This tremendous relationship equity will serve us well. Expectations for pricing and terms and conditions in the global property market are now well understood, which should make future renewals more orderly. At recent industry events, including Monte Carlo and CIAB, our clients told us that they want more of our capacity and want to further broaden their partnership with us. Our confidence in our strategy and in the strength and durability of the market is high. I am excited by the magnitude of the opportunity we have created for the business. We are extremely well-positioned with the expertise, global capabilities and financial strength to seize this generational market opportunity and to optimize the portfolio for the long-term. Now turning to our Insurance division. In our primary business, rate continues to exceed loss trend with improvements across multiple lines. We achieved an 11% increase in our core portfolio, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. In addition to property, improved pricing was particularly strong in marine and other specialty lines. We grew the business approximately 4% and generated more than $1 billion in gross written premiums. Growth in the quarter was diversified and particularly strong across property, where we see excellent opportunities and specialty lines such as marine, aviation, trade credit and political risk. The growth was offset by reductions in workers' compensation and financial lines where the market is less attractive. Additionally, we are gaining traction internationally, where we are methodically scaling our capabilities and our platform. Our focus remains on driving bottom line growth. We continue our disciplined underwriting to take advantage of high margin opportunities and reduce exposure in pockets of business that do not meet our profitability objectives. The attritional loss ratio improved year-over-year to 63%. Our pre-tax catastrophe losses at $10 million, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums were modest, leading to an improvement in the reported combined ratio to 92.6%. We achieved an underwriting profit of $66 million in the quarter and a record profit of $196 million year-to-date. We continue to attract and develop best-in-class talent. We share our vision for the company and our commitment to world-class customer service. I am bullish about the momentum we have created for our business and Everest's position in the market. We have every advantage at our disposal, a world-class team, strong and diversified reinsurance and insurance platforms and market tailwinds at our back to accelerate our progress and build even greater value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another very strong quarter and built upon the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. The company reported operating income of $613 million or $14.14 per diluted share in the quarter, equating to an operating income return on equity of 19.2%. Year-to-date, total shareholder return or TSR, stands at 24.5% annualized. We significantly improved our overall combined ratio while generating double-digit growth as pricing and terms remain attractive in most lines of business around the world. The company's strong performance in the third quarter was led by our team's high level of execution in our core markets and we have a number of tailwinds across both of our businesses heading into the last quarter of the year and into 2024. Looking at the Group results for the third quarter of 2023, Everest reported gross written premium of $4.4 billion, representing 23.4% growth in constant dollars year-over-year. The combined ratio was 91.4%, which includes 5 points of losses or $175 million from pre-tax natural catastrophes, net of estimated recoveries. The natural catastrophe losses in the quarter were driven by a number of midsized events globally. Group's attritional loss ratio was 59%, 120 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led by the reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The Group's commission ratio increased 50 basis points to 21.4% on mix changes, while the Group's expense ratio remains a competitive advantage of 6.1%, up modestly year-over-year as we continue to invest in our talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums grew 32.7% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. As Juan mentioned, this was a record for the segment. The strong growth was driven by double-digit increases in Property Pro rata, Property Cat XOL, Casualty XOL and Casualty Pro rata and was broad-based globally. The combined ratio was 91%, which improved from 115% in the prior year. The prior year period included $620 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums, largely due to Hurricane Ian. The attritional loss ratio improved 160 basis points to 57.5% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate in terms, particularly in property, which we expect to continue throughout 2024. The commission ratio was 24.8%, an increase of 90 basis points from the prior year due to the impact of reinstatement premiums from the Q3 Cats last year. There was a modest 30 basis point underlying mix impact benefit, excluding the Q3 2022 reinstatements. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 2.5%, which was essentially flat year-over-year. We continue to lean into the hard reinsurance market and the equity capital raise deployment remains on track and will be fully deployed by January 1 renewals. Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew 3.5% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. As you may have noticed, gross written premium growth was more modest this quarter as the division enjoyed double-digit growth in a diversified mix of property and specialty lines, while being partially offset by lower written premiums in workers' compensation and financial lines. Overall, pricing remains ahead of loss trend, and we continue to see attractive market opportunities across our book of business. We will also continue to have underwriting discipline in areas we find less attractive as we exhibited this quarter. The combined ratio was 92.6%, which improved from 103.5% in the prior year. The division benefited from a relatively low level of natural catastrophe losses in the quarter in the amount of $10 million net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums, further demonstrating the success of our derisking actions on our portfolio. The attritional loss ratio improved slightly this quarter to 63.1% driven primarily by business mix, given the higher proportion of longer tail lines of business. The commission ratio improved 120 basis points largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of seating commissions. The underwriting-related expense ratio was 16.7%, largely driven by certain one-off expenses and the continued investment in our global platform. And finally, to cover investments, tax and the balance sheet, net investment income increased $255 million to $406 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher new money yields, our investment in floating rate securities and higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $75 million of net investment income, a sequential improvement as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.2% to 4.2% year-over-year, and our reinvestment rate remains close to 6%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 2.7 years given the attractive level of short rates. And as a reminder, the 23% of our fixed income investments are in floating rate securities. For the third quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate was 6.5%, which was lower than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year, and this was largely due to geographic income splits. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $11.3 billion or $13.1 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of $242 million as compared to the end of the second quarter, resulting from rate increases and foreign exchange movements. Cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion during the quarter was a company record and book value per share ended the quarter at $258.71, an improvement of 22.4% from year-end 2022. When adjusted for dividends of $5.05 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $301.76 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 16.4%. Net leverage at quarter end stood at 18.6%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent third quarter of 2023 and is well-positioned heading into the final quarter of the year and into 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions . We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question I had for you is on the demand for Property Cat reinsurance headed into this next year. And I'd just be interested if there's any color you can provide from early discussions and indications around that piece of things in terms of just thinking through last year, the retentions brought up a bit, I think limits in certain cases, weren't taking up as much as insured values were going up, that kind of thing. Are you seeing some willingness to reverse some of those actions? Do you think you'll see that kind of growth in the Property Cat reinsurance market this next year? James Williamson : [Audio break] on demand is that we see very strong signals that our clients are looking for more Property Cat capacity. And as you say, there was, I think, some pent-up demand at 1/1 of '23 that ultimately didn't get fulfilled. And so they're now back in the market and seeking capacity. We are having discussions with our clients actively about the 1/1 renewal and have also taken advantage of some opportunities to do some private placement activity in the latter half of this year to start filling in that demand. So I think that's a very strong signal and our view with that is that, that will continue to drive really attractive returns in that market. As respects retention levels and the market's reaction to that and what might happen next year, our view is, overall, the movement in retentions were necessary and appropriate. There clearly was too much industry loss activity flowing into the reinsurance sector that needs to be retained in the primary market. Now does that mean that every single carrier landed in the right spot, probably not. And I'm sure there'll be some adjustments around the edges. But fundamentally, I don't see any change in terms of going backwards on retentions. Alex Scott : Got it. And in terms of a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about Casualty Reinsurance and just your comfort with the price adequacy of the quota-share commissions and so forth. We heard that there was some negativity coming out of Monte Carlo from some of the European reinsurers. What's your perspective on some of the social inflation concerns and how well that's being captured in price and willingness to grow in some of those areas? James Williamson : Sure, Alex. It's Jim again. So as you say, I mean, this issue is clearly on the minds of the market, and it's been much discussed, including by Everest with our customers at both Monte-Carlo and CIAB. I think to fully understand our view of the market and what happens next, you really have to understand the context of how we built our book of business. We've been incredibly deliberate and focused on managing the market cycle, and growing with the best-in-class cedents around the world, right? So we timed it correctly. We grew after the market began to harden. In 2019, we grew with best-in-class underwriters. We did not write the entire market. And I think some market participants did do that, and their results and their market commentary reflects that error. And you also may have heard recently if you expressed, I think, that reinsurers have been slow to recognize the changes that are happening around social inflation and the other trends you mentioned. I mean that is absolutely not the case with Everest. You would have seen our approach over the last 3-plus years. We've been very decisive on the reserve front. We've been prudent in our loss picks and which we've maintained by the way, even though pricing over the last couple of years has exceeded our expectations. We've been updating our trend factors on a frequent basis. So we are staying very much close to these trends and staying on top of them. So today, we are sitting here with a very strong book with the best underwriters in the market. And those underwriters are not sitting by idly waiting for bad things to happen, which, by the way, is why we are starting to see signs of some reacceleration of rate taking among many of our clients, they're managing this closely. That said, social inflation is real. It's a real trend that needs to be managed. And so our approach at whether it's the January 1 renewal that's coming up or really any renewal is to assess each deal on its merits. And we do that in a very rational way. If the deal passes muster and is delivering returns we want, we'll write it. If it doesn't, we are more than happy to move away from it. We have many, many options to deploy our capital, which is why diversification is so important in our business, many different ways to get to our financial goals. And so we have the flexibility to move among deals. The other point that I would make just relative to a piece of your question around ceding commissions, given all these trends, our expectation is that ceding commissions will continue to improve. We've seen that movement already begin and we expect it to strengthen considerably as we move into 2024. Alex Scott : Thanks for all the details. James Williamson : You got it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Shanker : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe there's no answer to this question, but obviously, the attachment points have gone up this year and the portfolio is more risk averse than it was a year ago, presumably. Given the moderate and frequent catastrophes this quarter, is there any way of putting in context what the Cat loss would have been had it happened last year instead of this year? James Williamson : Sure, Josh, this is Jim. Well, one point I would start with, I know you've made a point that it was a moderate Cat quarter and I think we feel very good about our Cat loss. But this quarter, from an industry perspective was anything but moderate. I mean we tracked over 80 events around the world. You had significant hurricane activity, which fortunately because of landing points, et cetera, did not do significant damage. But the comment I would make, and as you say, it's sort of an unanswerable question, but you've seen our year-to-date performance in terms of our reported Cat losses. And that's happening against the backdrop of a year that's likely going to be another $100 billion plus industry loss a year, which is incredible, right? And our expectation is that if you repeated the losses of 2022, for example, our loss this year against those same events would have been meaningfully lower, and that's because of attachment points. It's because of portfolio management, it's because of aggregation, it's our underwriting discipline, it's all those things laddering up. So we have clearly changed and improved the risk profile of the book, particularly when you're talking about a large number of mid to large sized Cat losses. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And then if I can get one more in. You mentioned that you're ready to deploy the capital you raised earlier in the year at January 1. Is there any way to discuss the degree to which capital is underdeployed right now in 3Q '23? And what the impact might be if you were fully deployed the way you want to be? James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Josh. Jim again. Well, look, so just to kind of go back to what we said after the capital raise, our expectation was that we would begin the deployment meaningfully with the 7/1 renewal that there would be incremental opportunities through the back half of 2023, and then we would complete the deployment at the January 1 renewal. So, we have done exactly that. We've begun the process of deployment. We had a really strong 7/1. The back half of the year after 7/1 gets quieter, but there's been some nice deal activity both at the renewal periods as well as on a private placement basis. And based on the conversations we've had with our cedents, we see a very strong path to completing the deployment. We really have no concerns around that. So I'm not going to speculate on, well, what if I just sort of deploy all the capital at 7/1. But what I can say is the path to completing that process, as we described, is incredibly clear. Mark Kociancic : Yes, Josh, it's Mark. Just to add a couple of points to Jim's commentary. So number one, we are obviously very, very certain of our ability to deploy by 1/1. So you're dealing essentially with a 6-month time frame between the raise and the 1/1 deployment along the way. Clearly, we are deploying it where we see fit. From an investment point of view, it's fully deployed the way we would like it for the time being. No issue for us to carry a little bit of excess capital. That's going to get remunerated to some extent, but will be, like I said, fully deployed by 1/1. And there's no benefit to rushing any kind of deployment. We want to stay disciplined and focused just as our initial plan back in May for the equity raise indicated. Juan Andrade : Josh, and this is Juan. Just maybe to put a fine point on it. Rates are still improving in property. And we also got paid a lot more for the risk that we took, and so that's part of the confidence that we have in being able to deploy this fully by the 1/1 renewal. Joshua Shanker : And so we should expect a healthy growth with 1/1 given all that you've said? James Williamson : Yes, Josh, it's Jim. I mean my expectation is we are going to grow our Property Cat writings with our core clients very nicely. Again, we see significant demand. Our expectation is that risk-adjusted rates will increase at the 1/1 renewal. So lots of opportunity in the environment. Joshua Shanker : Thank you for the extended answer. I appreciate it. Juan Andrade : Right. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you and good morning. My first question piggybacks on your thoughts on 1/1 renewals in the property reinsurance market. So certainly, you sound very constructive. You're also talking about demand being up. What about the supply side? Because I would have thought that with relatively benign reinsurance losses this year and certainly in hurricane season, you're going to see an uptick in capital. So how are you thinking about that and the kind of supply-demand dynamic, especially for maybe more remote risk, which seems to be where the insurers are more interested in playing right now into 1/1, is the constructive view really driven by supply/demand? Or is it more about sentiment and discipline considering maybe a more balanced equation this year? Juan Andrade : Yes. Yaron, this is Juan. Thank you for the question. Look, I think from our perspective, you're seeing a couple of dynamics that really have not fundamentally changed since the beginning of the year since we've been talking about this issue. Number one, there's still definitely a supply and demand imbalance that's out there. And I think as we've discussed before, whether that's $100 billion or $40 billion, it doesn't really matter because it's a pretty big gap between supply and demand. And there has not been a particularly large or moderate influx of capital into the industry to close that gap. So there's definitely that imbalance that continues to exist on the supply side. In addition to that and building on what Jim said earlier, you're still seeing pent-up demand and increased demand from our cedents across the board. A lot of that is also generated by, frankly, a flight to quality. It is basically cedents wanting to work with more companies like us who have stronger balance sheet, who've been very constructive into renewals, et cetera. So from that perspective, we are not seeing anything in the environment right now that really fundamentally changes the pricing trajectory or the trajectory of this business going into 1/1. And frankly, further, you saw the growth rates that I quoted earlier in my prepared remarks, where we were up over 40% of property. You heard Jim's comments just a minute ago about what he expects to see at 1/1. So we do expect that tailwind to continue to be behind us as we go forward. But let me ask Jim to jump in and see if he wants to add anything to that. James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Yaron. A couple of other points I'd add to what Juan said. I mean there is -- I think you've referred to it as a sentiment, but there's an underwriting discipline that underlies all of this, irrespective of how much capital is available to underwriters. In our industry, every underwriter I've talked to, they want to get paid more for the risk they've been taking, and that's a reflection of the last several years of elevated Cat losses and even what we've seen this year and in this quarter. And I don't see any sign that's dissipating. And then to your -- the other point you made around more remote layers and that seems like an area where more people want to participate. You've seen some Cat bond activity up there, et cetera. I mean that how much rate gets added to the effects of 2023 and at which levels will remain to be seen. But in our view, it doesn't really matter. If there's more supply at the remote level, that means that just below that there'll be great opportunities. We are very flexible and nimble in where we deploy our capital. And so those kinds of impacts don't really reflect our -- or change our opportunity. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. That's very helpful. And then if I could maybe shift gears to the Insurance segment. And I think, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about some mix shift as maybe driving the loss ratios to stay -- have unchanged year-over-year despite the fact that you're getting rate over trend. Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? Because for me as an outsider, if I look at the book, it seems like property and short tail lines grew by about 40% year-over-year. In aggregate, over the last 12 months, I see other specialty up 40%. And then we see some of the lines that I would have thought have higher attritional loss ratios, such workers' comp and professional liability actually coming in a bit. So I'd love to better understand the dynamics there if you could elaborate? Mark Kociancic : Okay, Yaron. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and then I'll ask Karm to finish and add some color to it. Look, first of all, I think the attritional loss ratio is pretty much right where it should be. We are still setting conservative loss picks for casualty lines in particular. We are in an elevated risk environment. We want to be prudent on that. We are obviously getting rate, and we are getting the kind of business we want to write in terms of cycle managing this particular marketplace. So you've seen some increases in writings and decreases in different lines, and that gives you a sense of our discipline in the marketplace. And so that mix in the attritional loss ratio is coming out too broadly stable with last year. We don't see any problem with that. We've got an embedded margin in there that we are quite comfortable with, quite confident in, and we think it takes into account the risk environment that's out there for the different lines we've underwritten. Michael Karmilowicz : Yes. And Yaron, I would add -- this is Mike Karm. I would add to it a couple of things. First, the focus for us is Juan stated in his opening comments, is about profitability, and we've been leaning into the first party lines pretty heavily, particularly in the property, aviation and marine. And then you see the other specialty lines like you mentioned, we are driving lines [indiscernible] and energy, where we see really, really strong risk-adjusted returns. I think you'll see that play through, hopefully on the [technical difficulty]. Ultimately, that's being offset when you think about what we are in that cycle management that Mark mentioned, particularly on the workers' comp and financial lines, and that offsets it. If you think about the quarter for us, we are focused on mix. That is our general focus ultimately is to get the loss ratio continue to get lower. But for us, ultimately, is really trying to make sure that we are leaning into the market where there's opportunity and again, being disciplined around what we don't chase. And we don't chase the lines that we think right now. We are not showing those risk-adjusted returns. So if you took those out, particularly the workers' comp and particularly the financial lines, our growth would have been where we are year-to-date around 9% plus. So I think for us, we tend to focus on the long term, it's really about generating the right mix and making sure that we are driving the best loss ratio we can do. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just looking at the paid to incurred ratio ex catastrophes and reserves. It's been, I think, not just you all, but it's been ticking up a bit year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Anything worth calling out or talking about in terms of trend there? Mark Kociancic : Mike, it's Mark. I wouldn't say there's anything specific to say there. I think it's largely your portfolio mix that's just driving that trend, mix of property, the long-tail lines. There's no particular significant set of claims or COVID settlements or anything like that, that's in the mix. So from my standpoint, it's just a natural outcome of the portfolio mix. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. I guess switching gears a bit back to the discussion on ceding commissions. The business mix has changed a lot over time. And I know you used to -- I think the wording it could improve considerably. Any perspective on kind of like if ceding commissions are still -- many points different than they were many years ago, right? But I know your business mix has changed a lot, too. So is there any context about what considerably could mean if things do go -- continue to move in favor of reinsurers into '24? James Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim Williamson. Look, we've -- one of the things we said this year is that ceding commissions on Casualty Pro rata overall have moved by about a point. And obviously, it differs by deal and geography and all those sorts of things. I think our view is that, that will accelerate and needs to accelerate. And we've certainly seen some anecdotes that you probably would have heard of as well of deals in the back half of this year moving by more than that, and we've seen some of that as well. And I think that bodes well for us in 2024 being able to accelerate from that one point to a larger number. I'm not going to predict what that ends up being, but the trend line around getting a better outcome is certainly there. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Got it. And maybe lastly, just wanted to make sure on Everest historical Cat load guidance, is it correct that your last Cat load guidance was less than 6%. And I'm -- I clearly heard -- but we clearly heard what you said about if Cat losses last year happened this year, what would happen, but then also you're probably leaning into the marketplace as well and business mix has changed. So just is less than 6% the most recent update? Mark Kociancic : Yes. Roughly 6% is the expected annual Cat load that we would have in our operating plan for the year. Now that's consistent -- broadly consistent with what we said at the IR Day back in '21. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Ward from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering if you had any preliminary view on maybe the industry exposure for Hurricane Otis in Acapulco? Juan Andrade : Yes. Sure thing, Mike. This is Juan Andrade. Look, I think Otis is a great example of what we've been talking about over the last few minutes. And the reason why frankly, the property cat market will continue to be hard into '24 and '25. Let's put it in the context of what we said earlier, right? We saw 80 events roughly around the world that we were able to track. The industry loss now is at about $93 billion, 9 months year-to-date, headed well probably into $100 billion plus by the end of the year. And now you have something like Otis, which if you follow what happened with that storm, it basically exploded from being a 70-mile an hour storm to be at 165 miles an hour in a period of about 12 hours, which was pretty significant strengthening and then hitting Acapulco, right? So this is one of the things that when you look at the world, you realize that you still need to continue to push for pricing. You need to continue to push for cash flow points being up, terms and conditions, et cetera. Look, from our perspective, we expect that loss to be modest at the end of the day, I can't speak for others out there. But I think this is also the discipline that you've seen from us on how we manage our volatility and our accumulations around the world. Michael Ward : Thanks. That's helpful. Maybe on the expense ratio front, the internal investments seem a little weighted to insurance. I guess as you look to 2024, do you expect that to set up softer comps in that segment or for the group overall? Mark Kociancic : I missed the last three words on that, sorry. Could you repeat it, Mike? Michael Ward : I was just -- looking into '24, I was wondering if you expect the expense ratio weighted towards insurance to set up softer comps, whether it's insurance or just for the group overall? Mark Kociancic : Well, we are continuing to expand in insurance, both in North America, but also internationally. So that comes with a bit of front end loaded expenses, something we think we can manage well within our combined ratio expectations for the business. It's a bit elevated right now compared to prior years as we start to gear up. But it's not something that I would expect to have any kind of meaningful impact on our combined ratio going forward. Having said that, I think the benefits of our expansion, this is something we'll get into in our Investor Day, but that's something we feel very confident about going forward in terms of being a future profit driver and an expansion of our franchise offering. Michael Ward : Thanks, guys. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I just have one, and I guess it's on the Kilimanjaro bond. So earlier in the year, it looked like you guys let a couple of hundred million of those expire without replacing them. And it looks like there's almost another $0.5 billion of those that expire at year-end. And I'm just curious if there is a plan to replace those with some other form of reinsurance? Or should we think about the capital raise you did earlier this year is potentially going to fill a little bit of that. Mark Kociancic : Ryan, it's Mark. So let me take a shot at this. I think whenever we talk about our capital shield, we always start with the gross risk that we are underwriting. We essentially want to be gross underwriters. It's not a flow-through or anything else in terms of the use of retrocession cat bonds, et cetera. So that's kind of the starting point. So we have a substantial laddering of Cat bonds, typically over a 4- or 5-year type of duration. There are different layers at which they attach and our book changes as well on the growth side from time to time. So we take the gross portfolio that we are underwriting into account. We take our overall cat position into our account, and then we start to modify. And there's a couple of other factors that would go into it. So let me just start with the easy stuff. So we always -- we have the ability to use and we prefer to use Mt. Logan, our third-party sidecar vehicle as much as we can in terms of hedging and aligning it with the kind of risk we are taking in property cat. Tactical use of ILWs on a periodic basis is another tool that we use, and we use this proactively, depending on where the efficiency of the pricing and the placements are for cat bonds and ILWs and then Logan, of course. So we also take into account the capital position. You referenced the capital raise in May as an additional source of capital base for the company. So that definitely enters the equation. And lastly, I would throw into the mix the economic capital at risk graph that we talk about frequently in our investor deck. And essentially, that space that we are comfortable playing in shows that we have a lot of room to expand risk appetite within our tolerances for tail risk, earnings at risk. And we tend to do that, especially when we see superior margin on the types of risks that we are underwriting, particularly property cat. And so we take all of these factors that I've mentioned to plan out our capital shield going forward. And so obviously, we had a conscious decision to not renew the -- I think we had two bonds in the spring. We did add another one at a different layer, but net-net, there was a reduction. We've got significant capacity that's up for maturity in -- I believe it's November, December. And that's something that we are taking into account now, but I've given you the framework of how we look at it. So I can assure you that given our ambition as a gross underwriter and pursuing superior risk adjusted returns, we are going to look at the options on the capital shield side relative to our gross book as we make those decisions. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. I guess I wanted to step back with the substantial growth as you're leaning into the market and property and the reinsurance side, I mean you're also reporting the growth in the insurance operations on property short tail. Could you just talk to us about how you're managing risk aggregation because it's a lot of growth and just I'm sure there's a lot of involvement in managing your risk, but give us some perspective there? James Williamson : Yes, Greg, this is Jim Williamson. It's clearly an important topic. We have a very robust risk management process at Everest that spans both our reinsurance and our insurance business across really all aspects of the risk we are taking, whether it's property cat, it's credit risk, casualty, et cetera. And there are robust processes underneath that framework where underwriters in the respective divisions are analyzing our aggregation, assessing risk reward. We have a companywide risk reward scorecard that shows us where we are getting best paid for capital deployment. And we leverage that process to ensure that we are moving capacity to the areas of the business that drive the best returns. And so what you would have seen, for example, earlier this year, if we rewind the clock in those discussions, Mike Karm and I were staying very close on what was happening in the reinsurance market. And so reinsurance started consuming more of the available capacity because that's where the opportunities lie. That started to balance out a little bit more now as the opportunity in insurance has strengthened so much. So that's the process we use. If you look at our PMLs by peak zone, we are still in really good shape in all of our peak zones. We do monitor it very carefully. But as Mark indicated, on an earnings and capital at risk, or if you look at our stated risk tolerances in our ORSA filings, et cetera, we are all well within risk tolerances, which gives us room to grow both reinsurance and insurance as these opportunities emerge. Juan Andrade : Yes, Greg. And one thing that I would add to what Jim just said, and this is Juan. A lot of it is rate, not necessarily exposure, right? And that's the trade that we've talked about in the past that is an excellent trade for us, which is, we are able to get significant rate for similar exposure and significantly better risk adjusted returns. And that's our focus right now, and basically we are achieving that. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Sorry, I guess you're going to get all four of us, Greg, it's Mark here, and then I'll let Mike finish it off. I just want to add two points. So number one, we have very clearly defined risk tolerances inside the company for how much risk we are willing to take. Those are not going to be breached. Those are governed at the Board level, respected by management, and we have a clear process to manage that stuff, a lot of flexibility there as well. And number two, we are fairly diversified and broad based with our exposures as well on a geographic and line basis, which also helps. You're not seeing single concentrations that are onerous in the different zones. Mike? Michael Karmilowicz : Sure. Yes. And I'll finish it off. I guess just from a perspective, you've seen over the last few years in insurance, we've meaningfully derisked a lot of the portfolio, particularly in the peak zones. Over the last 2 years alone, you saw us exit the Florida condo business, not just because it wasn't profitable, but because it really didn't meet our risk-adjusted returns and we just saw the regulatory environment and litigation environment changing. And then more importantly, the specific portfolio actions we've taken around our hurricane 100 PML over 40%, we reduced that. We took our gross limits in our wholesale, which is more cat-prone again and reduce that over 40% deployed limits over the last year. And what you're seeing from us right now is basically getting much, much better risk adjusted returns, but really derisking our concentration around these P zones and really basically diversifying the portfolio, not just domestically, but globally as well. Gregory Peters : Well, that's good detail. Juan, I think you mentioned the durability of the market in your prepared remarks and I know very well, many of us are focused on wind in North America wind and which has not been an issue this year, at least in a sort of material way. But there hasn't been many losses in fire at DIC in North America either. And I'm just curious, I know it's rather a specific question, but do you see any change in pricing or terms in fire or DIC going into 1/1 considering the lack of any loss there? Juan Andrade : Look, I think -- thanks, Greg. It's Juan. I think ultimately, all of this goes back to the fundamental question as to how much capacity is available for property in general. So I think it is part of the same equation. And so in our view, we expect this market to continue the way it is. You look at the rates that you're getting in wholesale in North America are basically 30% or plus. In the retail property in North America, they're 20% to 30%, and that has continued. That sort of gone unabated in this period of time. So I think that same dynamic that we talked about earlier, where not only is there a supply and demand issue here, but there's also the psychology that Jim was talking about. I think Yaron may have asked the question. The environment hasn't fundamentally changed. And so because of that, I don't think there's going to be a fundamental change in pricing in property ex cat at this point in time. Gregory Peters : Fair enough. Thank you for the answers. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Greg. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Two really quick questions. First, Mark, in addition to the investment spend, I think you noted some one-time expenses in insurance. I was wondering whether there's any way of quantifying that? Mark Kociancic : Well, one-time expenses. So let me break it down into kind of two components on the insurance expansion. So I would say roughly maybe a little less than two-thirds of our expense is compensation related to human capital. So we are expanding that's going to provide future bandwidth to underwrite and current bandwidth. It's clearly actionable. The second piece is you are dealing with technology spends as well to improve systems and middle office process type stuff. So that stuff is making its way through. It's very manageable. It's a relatively modest amount, and it's something that comes first and the growth is trailing somewhat. But we definitely see this paying for itself and again, manageable within the combined ratio assumptions that we have for the plan. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Second question, just to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I think, Juan, you've talked about a lot of executives have noted that this year -- or sorry, the 1/1 '24 reinsurance renewals should be much more orderly. Is there any benefit to the more chaotic renewals that we saw last year? Did that -- or are there any good guys embedded in that? Juan Andrade : Well, look, I mean, you always want to be in a place where your customers, your cedents and the brokers sort of understand the situation and understand what you are, essentially putting forth the storms, conditions, et cetera, et cetera. And I think that was a more challenging renewal last year because the market changed so quickly. I think what we see now is basically what I articulated earlier, where, at this point in time, I think we all recognize the world that we are living in, we all recognize the environment. Discussions have begun much earlier than they did last year. And so from that perspective, I think that's actually a pretty good thing. So we feel pretty good about it. I think, frankly, the only benefit that I would have seen last year is the fact that Everest was one of the first, if not the first, to get out and offer constructive terms and conditions and pricing, whereas a lot of our competitors were still looking to essentially fill the retro buckets to know how much capacity they had. So I think for us, that was a good guy last year. But ultimately, I think having an orderly market is good for the industry. Meyer Shields : Perfect. Thank you so much. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Meyer. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Just one quick one here. Mt. Logan, I'm just curious kind of plans are for 1/1. Do you think you're going to be able to increase capital there and maybe investor demand for those types of facilities? James Williamson : Yes, Brian, this is Jim Williamson. Yes, Mt. Logan has had a pretty solid year from a capital raising standpoint, particularly against the backdrop of a lot of the big ILS allocators sort of being on the sidelines this year. We've raised over $250 million, AUM sits just under $1.1 billion. So feeling very good about that. The team at Mt. Logan has done a terrific job of building a pipeline of what we view as sort of world-leading allocators, being the really smart, long-term money, the sovereign wealth funds, the pensions, et cetera. And we do expect some incremental capital raising at 1/1 and throughout the course of next year. I will say, as a general comment, I've had a number of discussions recently with some large pension fund allocators, the challenge they still have is they've seen a lot of deterioration in other parts of their portfolio, which tends to bump them up against their ILS risk limits. And that is easing a little bit, but it's still a factor. And so I think -- which, by the way, we view as a good guy, it helps sustain momentum in our underlying market, which is our critical priority. But my guess is that we'll have some nice successes in 2024. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. James Williamson : Got it. Operator : The last question for today is a follow-up from Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Ward : Hey, guys. Thanks. I was just wanted to follow-up on the Otis and Acapulco. Is there any quantification on the potential industry exposure -- I know it's early. Juan Andrade : No, Mike, this is Juan. I think it's so early. I mean, this thing just made landfall really yesterday at this point in time. And for us, as I said, this is a modest exposure based on how we have managed the portfolio to reduce the volatility. But I think it's way too early. We haven't seen anything yet from any of the modeling agencies at this point in time. Michael Ward : Okay. Thanks so much guys. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Mike. Operator : That was the last question. Juan Andrade : Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions and for the excellent discussion. We had an excellent quarter, and I look forward to discussing the company's strategic plan at our Investor Day on November 14. I hope to see you all then. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Ltd. fourth quarter of 2023 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings, including extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was the most profitable year in our history. We delivered exceptional full year results. We achieved record underwriting income, record net investment income, record operating income, record net income and record operating cash flow. We executed on our objectives and delivered a 2023 operating ROE of over 23% and a total shareholder return of over 26%. The strength and quality of our franchise was evident as we achieved these results in another elevated catastrophe year, while also taking prudent actions to further strengthen our balance sheet, Everest capitalized on the hard market to grow in attractive lines across our businesses. Our precise execution at the 2024 January reinsurance renewal created excellent outcomes. We completed the deployment of our $1.5 billion equity capital raise on schedule and at superb risk adjusted returns. We expanded key client relationships, while improving the scale, quality and profit potential of our portfolio, giving us a strong start to the year. Market conditions remain strong. We are not seeing any meaningful new capacity enter the market and we expect conditions for upcoming renewals to remain excellent. Our capital strength positions us to profitably grow both underwriting businesses. At Everest Investor Day last November, we outlined our progress, strategy and financial objectives for the next three years. As you have seen from our 2023 results, we are on-track to achieve these goals. Our primary objective is to generate industry leading financial returns consistently and across market cycles and we have delivered. We are building on momentum created by our actions to transform Everest over the past four years. Operating as one Everest, we elevated all aspects of our business. Everest is a more diversified and higher margin business with a strong underwriting culture of execution and accountability. This guides our underwriting decisions and our drive to outperform and allows us to deliver on our long-term objectives. Turning to the full year financial highlights beginning with the Group. The Group delivered outstanding results in 2023. As I said, we achieved new company profitability records including annual operating income and net income which both exceeded $2.5 billion for the year. We grew by 21% in constant dollars, ending the year at nearly $17 billion in gross written premium. Our performance was supported by the execution of our strategies and our ability to take advantage of strong market conditions and reinsurance and insurance. We generated $1.2 billion in underwriting profit also a company record and we improved the combined ratio more than five points to 90.9% despite industry catastrophe losses exceeding $120 billion. We achieved a six point year-over-year improvement in the Group loss ratio contributing to our excellent underwriting results. Building the strength and flexibility of Everest balance sheet has been a priority for this management team since we took over this company. This was reflected in the quarter through our modest favorable development as we built additional strength into our already strong reserve position. Mark will provide more detail on these actions. Turning to investments, we achieved another record with annual net investment income of $1.4 billion driven by our actions to capitalize on the rising interest rate environment. Now for the underwriting segments beginning with reinsurance. The reinsurance division had an exceptional year. Our disciplined planning and execution in 2023 allowed us to capitalize on the generational hard property market, delivering outstanding top line growth and bottom line results. For the full year 2023, growth was 26% in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums with $11.5 billion in total gross written premiums. Growth was broad based as we expanded with core seeds, grew in targeted markets and allocated capital to higher return opportunities. We grew our core North America property catastrophe portfolio by over 30% had exceptional risk adjusted returns. Internationally, we grew our total property portfolio by over 40% with strong and targeted growth in Europe and Asia. We also leaned into growth opportunities outside of property catastrophe including in targeted proportional property deals, aviation, marine, and in facultative with strong of returns in these lines. The division delivered $1.3 billion in underwriting profit for the year. The attritional loss ratio improved by 4 point to 57.7%, and the attritional combined ratio was down 110 basis points from 2022 when adjusted for prior year commissions related to the reserve releases. We leveraged deep client and broker relationships and our strong balance sheet to build a more profitable and higher margin book, which culminated in outstanding results at the January 2024 renewal. At 1/1/\u201924, we grew our total property catastrophe portfolio by over 25% compared to expiring premium. Following the significant increases in 2023, we saw further property catastrophe rate increases at 1/1 broadly across geographies. In North America, the Property Cat XOL risk adjusted rate change was approximately 7%. Internationally, rates on our portfolio were up 14%. This trend also continued in specialty lines particularly marine and aviation. The flight to quality in the reinsurance market continued. Our leading market position allowed Everest to grow market share on oversubscribed deals with leading clients on the best quality Property Cat, cyber and specialty line treaties and in geographies around the world. Our clients signed down other carriers to make more room for Everest. We also played a leading role in several of the increased CAT limit purchases being made by some of the best primary insurance underwriters in the business. This reflects the strength of our franchise and reputation in the market. To illustrate the point, we generated close to $300 million in additional premium growth through increased shares on existing property treaties. The favorable terms and conditions that we achieved during the 2023 renewals held while attachment points which increased significantly last year or maintained. We were also surgical in our approach towards certain casualty lines at 1/1. We non-renewed 16% of our casualty and professional liability pro rata business particularly when ceding commissions did not meet our thresholds. These targeted actions however were partially offset by expanding shares on attractive casualty programs with select top clients. We achieved our objectives at 1/1 executing with the same discipline and focus Everest has consistently applied to shaping and diversifying the portfolio. We do not right the market. We selectively underwrite risks that meet our requirements. Our priority is growing the bottom-line to deliver leading financial returns. Coming out of the 1/1 renewal, the quality of our book is excellent. We are positioned to drive sustainable margin expansion, while continuing to distinguish ourselves as the preferred lead market platform. Now turning to our primary insurance division. 2023 was a pivotal year for Everest Insurance. We advanced our key objectives while establishing strong foundations. We solidified and enhanced the division's global leadership team with top talent in the right places operating through a regionalized structure aligned to customer needs. In 2023, we grew the insurance business by 10% in constant dollars, achieving record annual premium of over $5 billion. Growth was balanced and diversified by product, business line and geography. We saw excellent opportunities in property and specialty lines including marine, aviation, trade credit and political risk. We are disciplined. The modest growth in certain casualty lines was primarily driven by robust rate increases as we remain prudent in our writings and focus on lines of business meeting our return thresholds. We continued to shift to shorter tail lines with favorable pricing and a strong profit trajectory. For both the year and the fourth quarter, we achieved a broad-based 12% rate increase in our core portfolio, excluding workers compensation and financial lines. Beyond property, pricing accelerated and was particularly strong in marine and other specialty lines, commercial auto, general liability and access liability. Overall, rate remains ahead of loss strength. We will only grow where we can do it profitably. We will remain disciplined in less attractive lines including D&O, workers' compensation and commercial auto. The combined ratio increase was driven by our reserve strengthening to address the impacts of social inflation along tail lines in the 2016 to 2019 period. The core underlying performance of the book is strong. We advanced our disciplined international strategy led by a proven entrepreneurial team of industry leaders and local underwriting talent. They accomplished a great deal in 2023, scaling our insurance platform across Latin America, the UK and Ireland, Continental Europe in Asia Pacific where our value proposition is differentiated and eagerly welcome. We made strides implementing systems and capabilities enabling us to operate from common platforms and drive efficiencies. We are on-track for new openings this year in Colombia, in Mexico and Australia. While we have tremendous headroom in lucrative markets, we are focused only on the most accretive opportunities. Since this management team took over in 2020, we have significantly increased prudence around risk selection and deployed a disciplined underwriting strategy. We rebuilt the underwriting engine from top to bottom, investing in top tier underwriting and experienced talent. We significantly strengthened our underwriting guidelines and risk selection parameters. Additionally, we pushed rate in excess of trend, broadly raised our inflation assumptions and initial loss picks. We added more loss sensitive features, raised deductibles, and lowered limits. We exited certain social inflation prone industry classes and invested in additional claims technology. As I said, if business doesn't meet our underwriting criteria, we just won't write it. As we head into 2024, the insurance division is executing from a strong foundation and is well positioned to deliver on the targets we set out for the business at Investor Day. Our financial results led to the most profitable year in Everest's history. We are building on this momentum with standing start to 2024. As favorable market conditions persist, we are leaning into robust tailwinds across our reinsurance and insurance businesses with the full power of Everest behind us, and we will make the most of the opportunities in front of us. We have the right team driving a clear strategy with multiple avenues to deliver on our primary goal of generating consistent leading financial returns. We are confident about delivering on our objectives. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had a strong finish to 2023. For the full year, Everest delivered record annual results in underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income. This drove annual operating earnings per share of $66.39 and an operating return on equity of 23.1%, the annualized TSR or total shareholder return was excellent at 26.5%. 2024 is off to a great start as we successfully executed on our 1/1 renewals, where we enjoyed strong growth and deployed the remaining capital from our $1.5 billion equity raise last spring. We capitalized on our market position and prevailing conditions, growing in attractive lines of business with expected returns in excess to cover our financial targets. This was evidenced in particular by strong growth in our Property Cat book globally. Market fundamentals remain strong and we expect the upcoming renewals throughout 2024 to continue to be excellent. Our underwriting franchises are fully mobilized and our capital strength gives us lots of capacity for 2024. This positions us well for profitable organic growth. Turning to the fourth quarter results, operating income was $1.1 billion or $25.18 per diluted share, equating to an operating ROE of 32.4%. Looking at the Group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.3 billion representing 18.3% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 93.2% for the quarter, driven by improving underlying loss ratios offset by the results of an active CAT quarter and the CAT losses in the quarter were largely driven by Hurricane Otis, which made landfall in Acapulco, Mexico as a Category 5 Hurricane. I would note that the prior year quarter had much lower than average CAT activity. Everest also recorded modest net favorable reserve development of $5 million in the quarter, which we'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. The Group attritional loss ratio was 59%, 60 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement. The Group's commission ratio was 21.3%, when excluding the impact of 2.5 points from the profit commissions associated with favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segment related to the mortgage business, an improvement year-over-year. The Group expense ratio was 6.3% in the quarter, an excellent result as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross written premiums grew 21.9% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. The strong growth was primarily driven by double-digit increases in Property Pro rata, Property non-Cat XOL and Property Cat XOL, and was broad based globally. The combined ratio was 78.8%, an improvement of 8 points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 40 basis points to 57.8% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms, particularly in property. The attritional combined ratio improved 90 basis points to 85.1% when excluding the impact of $94 million in profit commissions associated with favorable mortgage reserve development this quarter. The normalized commission ratio was 24.8% when you exclude the 3.6% attributed to those profit commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year. Moving to insurance, gross premiums written grew 11.6% in constant dollars to $1.4 billion. We continue to methodically scale our primary franchise globally, while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short tail specialty lines. The growth in casualty and professional lines was largely driven by rate increases. A number of casualty lines saw pricing accelerate in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined in our approach as some lines are less attractive than others, including D&O, workers' comp and commercial auto as we've discussed on prior calls. The attritional loss ratio improved this quarter to 62.6%, driven primarily by business mix, given the higher proportion of short tail lines within the portfolio. The commission ratio improved 110 basis points, also largely driven by business mix as increased property writings earned through as well as increased volume of ceding commissions. The underwriting related expense ratio was 16.6% with the increase largely driven by the continued investment in our global platform. Now, let me touch on the reserve moves in the quarter. As we stated at our Investor Day, our objective is to book the company's overall reserve position at management's best estimate plus a margin. And as of year-end, we've accomplished that as our reserve position remains strong. This quarter, we recognized $5 million of net favorable reserve development following the completion of our detailed ground up review of all of our reserve portfolios for 2023. We released $397 million net of our embedded reserve margin from the reinsurance division, primarily from well-seasoned short tail lines like property and also our mortgage lines. The releases were split roughly evenly between the two lines. And this was partially offset by $392 million of strengthening in the insurance segment driven by a few specific casualty lines of business. The entire industry faces the real impact of social inflation focused on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. And Everest is seeing some of these same trends and we've prudently acted on them given the now well-developed loss patterns for those years and this is driven primarily by higher severity in general liability and to a lesser extent commercial auto liability. And this is contrasted with accident years 2015 and prior, which continue to show strength and stability and more recent accident years, namely 2020 and onward, where we see the benefit of significant rate increases, limit reductions and targeted portfolio management actions as Juan highlighted. We will be prudent and let long tail reserves from those more recent accident years from 2020 onwards continue to season more fully. As a result of these comprehensive actions, the portfolio today is a higher quality, more diversified book of business well-positioned to provide strong risk adjusted returns. In terms of the reinsurance division, we made marginal adjustments to long tail lines that were impacted by social inflation from 2016 to 2019 accident years and these adjustments were easily offset by favorable developments in other lines. Since this management team took over in 2020, we have made significant improvements to our reserving, underwriting and claims functions. And this allows us to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our feedback loop between underwriting, management, claims, pricing, and reserving. This allows us to manage information faster improving overall portfolio performance. We have been embedding conservatism into social inflation prone lines in both divisions to make sure we can manage these types of industry hurdles. In conjunction, the actions taken to build the company's balance sheet strength, Everest has significant financial flexibility, underwriting diversification, and the ability to better manage volatility. We were able to generate an operating ROE of over 23%, while taking actions to fortify the reserves on our balance sheet. As you can see from our full year 2023 results, we can manage issues as they arise and still produce excellent returns overall. Given our disciplined approach to acting on bad news early and good news late, we feel our reserve position is prudent and there is meaningful embedded margin that we will let season, we believe the balance sheet moves we made this quarter have closed the book on the 2016 to 2019 reserves and put us in very good shape to generate leading returns in the years ahead. Moving on, net investment income increased over $200 million year-over-year to $411 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management, higher new money yields, and our investment in floating rate securities as they benefit from higher reset rates. Alternative assets generated $41 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to rebound. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.5% to 4.7% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains at approximately 5%. We continue to take deliberate actions to best position our investment portfolio and capitalize on market conditions. We made a number of portfolio moves over the past quarter to take advantage of the evolving interest rate environment. We successfully executed our strategy to sell lower yielding bonds totaling $3.3 billion of market value in Q4, which resulted in after tax realized fixed income losses of approximately $210 million in the quarter, while reinvesting the proceeds into higher coupon bonds with higher credit quality and this contributed approximately 30 basis points to the book yield increase in the quarter and is expected to add significant additional interest income in 2024 and beyond. We generally purchased 10-year maturities thereby extending our duration modestly to 3.3 years, which is broadly consistent with our liability duration of 3.9 years. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our operating income tax rate before the Bermuda taxing impact was 14.5%, which was higher than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year, given the geographic distribution of income. However, the full year operating effective tax rate excluding the Bermuda tax impact was 10.5%, well within our expected range. Everest also booked a $578 million net deferred tax benefit in the quarter as a result of Bermuda's income tax guidelines and this will begin to be utilized in 2025 when the Bermuda income tax is in effect. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.2 billion or $13.9 billion when excluding net unrealized depreciation unavailable for sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after tax unrealized losses on the available for sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $723 million a decrease of $1.1 billion as compared to the end of the third quarter resulting from interest rate decreases. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion during the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Book value per share ended the quarter at $304.29 an improvement of 44.3% from year-end 2022 when adjusted for dividends of $6.80 per share year-to-date. Book value per share excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $320.95 versus $259.18 per share at year-end 2022, representing an increase of approximately 23.8%. This is an outstanding result and shows the value creation from 2023. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 16.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. As mentioned earlier, our capital raise back in May coupled with the organic capital generation of our portfolio throughout the year put us in a position of strength to be able to capitalize on a number of market opportunities. Another tangible example of this was our ability to reduce our CAT bond reliance at year end 2023 as we seek to retain more of the gross and net economics in lines of business with exceptional risk-adjusted return potential. So while our PMLs have gone up in the tail with the Cat bonds rolling off, we remain well within the risk tolerances of our predefined risk appetite as well as having ample room for additional organic growth. In addition, Everest had an excellent fourth quarter and year in 2023. We began 2024 with a strong set of renewals, plenty of dry powder for future renewals and attractive organic growth opportunities in both of our underwriting franchises. Our teams are fully mobilized to serve their markets. We have substantial flexibility and strong momentum across both businesses, leaving us very confident in our ability to deliver on the total shareholder return and combined ratio targets, we introduced at our most recent Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : I guess, I wanted to start with the reserve strengthening in insurance, and I appreciate the color that you offered in the prepared comments. But that said, it seems like there may be a little bit of a break with the messaging we heard in prior quarters, namely that the company was already -- had already started reserves considerably back in 2021, has cut loss picks conservatively high since then. So what's changed from that perspective now? And how can investors gain comfort or confidence that we're not going to see some similar pattern emerge in the reinsurance reserves? Mark Kociancic : Yaron, it's Mark here. So let me address that. I think, look, 2016 and '19 clearly is impacted by social inflation and there was a very marked rise in actual losses during the 2023 calendar year. And those years are exposed to social inflation and casualty, in particular, really showed signs of development for 2016 to '19. So we're seeing reported loss patterns that are very seasoned, very mature and the trends are undeniable. So for us, the issue really lies primarily in general liability. And from that standpoint, we believe we've captured it simply because these reporting patterns are fairly well developed, but the losses are on an actual basis now to a larger degree. And so there's less estimate involved more precision in how we're able to size that class or period of business. And so we feel pretty good about the fact that we're able to put this to. Juan Andrade : Yaron, in addition to that, this is the Juan Andrade. Look, I would say there is no change in the messaging from our perspective. We have been very consistent in the fact that we have a strong overall reserve position. We are confident in the most current years. You're right. We have raised inflation assumptions. We've raised our initial loss picks. We have pushed rate in excess of trend as well as a number of other things that I talked about in my remarks this morning. So we feel very confident about that. And I think as Mark said in his prepared remarks, we believe this closes the book on the 2016 to 2019 years. Yaron Kinar : And then maybe pivoting a bit to the current accident year and your current calendar year. In reinsurance, the underlying loss ratio, it did improve year-over-year, but the improvement actually subsided relative to what we saw earlier in the year, the first nine months. And intuitively, I would have thought that we'd see that improvement accelerate just as the changing terms and conditions and better rates that you implemented starting in 1/1/\u201923 would be earning in. So can you maybe address? Were there any offsets there? Anything I'm not thinking about correctly? Jim Williamson : Sure. Yaron, it's Jim Williamson. Thanks for the -- thanks for the question. So just to step back a little bit, our approach to establishing our quarterly loss ratios has been very consistent over the last few years. We set conservative loss picks as we enter the year. And then we don't tend to change them unless we see some bad news emerge. And so we do that at a very granular level. And so quarter-to-quarter, the only real effect you're going to see are mix related. And so what we have seen is, particularly on an earned premium basis, casualty is still greater than 50%. Operator : Pardon me. It appears, we have lost the connection with our speakers. Pardon me, everyone. We do have our speakers back, and we will move on to our next question, which comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Jim Williamson : Hold on, please. I'm sorry. Just one moment, let me -- this is Jim Williamson. Let me finish answering Yaron's question. Sorry for the interruption of their folks. So as I was saying, we did not take credit for the 1/1/\u201923 property rate increases in our 2023 property attritional loss ratio. And we do that out of prudence. We keep that pretty consistent year-to-year. And then the last factor, the only thing that affected our fourth quarter reinsurance attrition loss ratio was we did recognize the effect of 2 large property risk losses in the fourth quarter. And again, out of prudence, we bumped up our loss pick for those losses. That's about -- that's worth about 60 basis points on the total reinsurance loss ratio. So that also masks some of the underlying improvement that you'd be seeing from us, Yaron. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Josh Shanker : More questions about the insurance reserve charge, of course, $392 million of net adverse development principally related to '16 to '19 in general liability. But of course, those are inflationary CAGRs that are being set correctly, which span into 2020 to 2023. What was the gross amount of the inner impact on the loss reserves, I assume offset by development for frequency-related issues on the short-tail lines from the '20 to '23 period. I guess what I'm getting at is how much will reserve strengthen for inflationary issues on those later years? Mark Kociancic : Well, virtually, all of the strengthening took place in 2016 to '19, and that was really related to the inflationary pressure favorable development. We had some on the insurance side with respect to workers' comp, property and surety. But by and large, we're dealing with more of an isolated issue from '16 to '19. When we look at 2020 to onwards to 2023, we feel good about the loss picks that we've set and then the process that we followed there. So we've got a few points there. So start with underlying rate that's been achieved on an annual basis. And even before social inflation became even more elevated, we were increasing loss picks in 2020. And then there's the portfolio actions really identifying the root cause of some of the general liability development that we've had, and that's been acted upon. So the loss picks from 2020 to 2023 have reflected a proper amount for the social inflation risk, and we feel comfortable with those figures. And then going back to 2016 to '19, given the seasoning and the really well-developed patterns, payment patterns that we've seen, the fact that they're so mature approaching the 70%, 80%, 90% range depending on the year, you're looking at, that's what's giving us the confidence in that segment, and that's also why we're confident for the 2020 to 2023 period. Juan Andrade : Josh, this is Juan. I would also add maybe just a couple of things. Gross is very similar to net and there are no big moves under the covers per se. I think, as Mark basically just said. The other thing that's important to note in context always matters. When we're talking about general liability, for 2016 to 2019 and the actions that we took, they're really isolated to two things. One is a program that's now been put into runoff. The second one is related to a block of business that we have aggressively reunderwritten as well in the past couple of years. This is not endemic to the rest of the GL book in insurance. That also gives us confidence on the go-forward numbers. And hence, what you hear Mark saying that we have closed the door on the 2016 to 2019 years with this action. Josh Shanker : So look, I'm just someone who throws peanut shells from the cheap seats, and I apologize. To understand what you're saying is that the inflationary CAGR was underestimated in the '16 to '19 period, but even on those accident years, it was corrected in the 20 to 23 years such that you didn't have to make -- I mean I would assume that if you felt that the inflationary was 5% from the 6% all years need to be just up for that 6% CAGR. Is that a too simplistic way you're thinking about it? Mark Kociancic : No, you can look at it that way for sure. Josh Shanker : And then the question would be if the 2018 accident year inflationary CAGR was underestimated in '18, '19, '20, '21, '22 and '23, why don't I need to be concerned that the 2020 year was underestimated in 2021, '22 to '23? Mark Kociancic : Well, first of all, I go back to my other remarks that I was making. So you've got payment patterns for 2016 to 2019, well developed. And so we're showing ultimate loss ratios in the '16 to '19 period, which are markedly elevated from the initial loss picks. So that's one part. When we switch over to 2020, 2023 time frame, out of an abundance of prudence, we started with elevated loss ratios to begin with. So over and above what we would have expected. Then you're getting the rate in addition to that, and you've got the portfolio management, which is eliminating some of the root cause of the '16 to '19 development. So it's not just applying a raw number, a social inflation factor. There are other things that go to mitigate the development that could happen from 2020 to 2023 and probably more importantly, how do we get comfortable with those years. So GL for us from 2020 to 2023 still looks very good, good to us. There's -- we don't have an issue there. From 2016 to 2019, it was the lion's share of the problem that we're solving with this reserve charge today in insurance. Juan Andrade : Yes. And again, Josh, this is Juan. Just to add a little bit more color on that. Look, the bottom line is the factors you're talking about have already been addressed. And again, I would reiterate some of the things that Mark said, I think it's very important. They've been addressed, number one, by much higher loss picks that we started to put in place really at the end of 2019 for 2020. That's number one. The fact that we raised our inflation assumptions essentially in our loss trend select, so we price to it. Number three, the fact that additional pricing in excess of trend was coming in through that period of time, and on the underwriting side, the fact that we did a lot of different things, for example, increasing our loss sensitive mix, lowering limits, racing deductibles, all of that basically helped to give us the confidence that we're talking about today in addition to exiting social inflation prone industry classes. Josh Shanker : Okay. I know it's a complicated issue. I'll take anything else have offline. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan at Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Following up on the reserves as well. I was hoping can you give us a sense on where you're working your reserves overall and in each of the segments, insurance and reinsurance relative to the actuarial midpoint and where was it before? Mark Kociancic : So we're clearly looking to best estimate plus a margin overall. So we do feel confident with that. I can tell you two pieces to the margin point. So one is what's embedded in the balance sheet. And I think we've still got a good chunk of seasoned or embedded margin in the reserves. And then we have the more green years, particularly in long-tail casualty, which we feel strong about as well. But that's going to take some time to play out. So I would say there's an embedded margin in that's diversified in the current set of reserves. The second part is really the flow or the engine that's producing it. And this is what we're trying to emphasize with a lot of the remarks we made in the model lives. The steps that we've taken to ensure that we are producing margin accretive business, and we're just taking our time to let it season and we're not touching it right now. So when you think about the reserves that we've released, for example, you're seeing mortgage, for example. There was -- most of that release was from 2013 to 2019. So well-seasoned, very prudently reserved. We're letting that out. Similarly, on the property side, you've got 2020 to 2022 as the lion's share of those releases. Again, short-tail, well-seasoned, well defined, we're letting that out. And so we have this engine that is producing and embedding margins. And for longer tail lines, it takes more time to let it season for shorter tail, it can become available sooner. And so to get back to your point, best estimate plus a margin, feeling good about our positioning and the flow of margin in the future. Juan Andrade : Elyse, this is Juan. And just to add to what Mark is saying. To think about what we have been saying and said in this call today about the quality of the underwriting really over the last four years, the pricing environment that we've been in ahead of loss trend the portfolio management actions that we have done and how we have crafted both books to be higher quality. What that basically means is that there's more in the tank and there are lots of good news in the future that we just haven't touched for the reasons that Mark just articulated. They're just not well seasoned yet. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up question, you guys said that you made an adjustment in reinsurance, but I think, Mark, you said that it was marginal for some of those years, 2016 to 2019. Can you give us a sense of what the reinsurance charge was for those years? And I guess, why you didn't think you had to embed some extra conservatism and move that a little bit further? Mark Kociancic : Yes. It was marginal. You're looking at a very small percentage of the total reserves, low single-digit for those exposed years. I think there's a couple of things that you can look at, and I would start with the reserve charge we took in 2020 that was fairly meaningful at $400 million, and most of that was going into the casualty years from 2016 to '19. So I think we took a good chunk of that apple. Over the last few years, both sides, Insurance and Reinsurance, there has been some minor adjustments for those years throughout the time. So we have been nibbling away at the data that we've been seeing. 2023, I think, was more pronounced in terms of industry loss data for those years. But we were in a -- we were just in a much stronger position from a reinsurance point of view, on those years. I don't see any problem going forward on either side for '16 to '19 in either segment. Elyse Greenspan : When you say low single-digits, do you mean low single-digits millions or low single-digits as a percent of. Mark Kociancic : Percentage, percentage, yes. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just following up on the reserves. So Mark and Juan, you guys spoke about specific programs that are driving the insurance charge mainly on GL, but I guess I would have thought that the trends impacting those lines are the same trends that are impacting the rest of your book. So I'm just wondering, as you guys take a look at it, how do you make the conclusion that it's isolated to these books in these accident years and not other programs across GL, but other lines in general? Mark Kociancic : I think the data for us is quite definitive when you look at it. So in particular, 1 program and 1 block of business is driving a very strong majority of the development that we're seeing in GL. It doesn't mean it's 100%, but it's clearly a strong majority. And just in terms of other lines, made clear, umbrella, for example, on our side was performed well during that 20 to 16 -- to 2016 period. Professional liability, very minimal impact for us. So this is really general liability, and there were two main components for us, which we identified some years ago and began to act upon. But the 2016 to 2019 aspects of those two are what we're dealing with today. Juan Andrade : Yes, David. And what I would add is those two items that both Mark and I have mentioned, those are niche type businesses, not sort of standard type of GL. And essentially, we have closed that book for all intended purposes. David Motemaden : And then. Yes, just on that point, just closing the book. I guess I'm sort of just wondering any other color you can give us that would help us feel comfortable that this is behind us because I kind of look at the charge that you guys took in 2020. And then after that, there have been more additions. It sounds like you guys did a little bit here in 2023. So what makes you think we don't sort of see that same trend happen on the insurance side as well? Mark Kociancic : I think there's several points. First of all, you've got very well-developed reporting patterns for the '16 and '19 years. So again, anywhere from 70% to 90% development, completion of development for 2016 to '19. So that gives us a lot of confidence that we're dealing with actual data. We also have assumptions that I think are very prudent in terms of the social inflation impact. And so when you combine that altogether, we're able to capture with a high level of confidence what we think the ultimate loss ratios are going to be for really '17, '18 and '19, '16 is pretty much I think, done and really didn't move that much for us. The larger point is 2020 onwards, and I think this is what we've been trying to emphasize is we're benefiting from several factors, you can see with the process that we've embedded not only on the reserving side, but how we act upon information inside the company. And so you're seeing the claims data, what we're getting on the reserving side and embedding it within management pricing and underwriting. So which classes of business, which programs are causing issues or at risk? Are we getting adequate pricing for it? And so we're far more disciplined, I would say, 2020 onwards with respect to that. Second part, there's been a significant amount of rate that's accumulated on a quarterly basis beginning in Q4 of 2019. And that's clearly helping and it's supported by the industry loss data that's been developing since that point in time. And then you've got the prudent loss picks. Clearly, we've elevated our loss pick selection, taking into account social inflation factors, other risk factors, just trying to be more prudent as a management team. Nobody wants to go through this exercise. And so we recognize that when we started. And hence, the constant effort on portfolio management. I mean, that is ultimately the key understanding at a granular basis, your portfolio by line, by client, by policy what is driving your profitability? What is driving underwhelming results? What is driving good results? The risk selection aspect, and that's something that I think we've been able to do a pretty good job of since 2020. Mark Kociancic : The other piece I'd add to all this is as you think about us growing into the hard market years, these portfolio compositions are dramatically different. So to point to risk selection, we've massively cut down rates over 40% on average, our rates -- our overall limits are down in excess or we've actually continued to drive and thinking just on GL, our policy count is down over 23% in heavy risk selection, driving rate embedded to exceed margin. So we're making all the right steps to continue to be proactive in our portfolio management. Operator : And our next question today comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Gregory Peters : I'd like to pivot to the reinsurance business and a lot of market commentary and your commentary around the 1/1 renewals certainly seem more orderly on from a supply-demand perspective. I guess where I'm going with this is just the sustainability of price and terms and conditions that have been achieved over the last year. As we look to 6/1 and future renewal periods. So any perspective on that? Like, for example, we were hearing of more interest in the risk remote layers by the marketplace, et cetera. So just your perspective on how the market's changing inside reinsurance would be helpful. Jim Williamson : Everest did have another excellent Jan 1 renewals you heard Juan say we were able to deploy our incremental capital at really exceptional economics. We did grow the cat book, including leading or participating in many of the new top-off programs that you would have heard about as well as executing on a number of non-CAT opportunities in engineering and cyber, aviation and marine. So it's really excellent all around. In terms of the dynamics of the sustainability of the market on the Property Cat side, which is, I think, where the core of the question lies, I would really point to three critical factors in terms of what is driving or what drove the market correction that started in the back half of 2022, and then obviously reached a peak and sustained itself through 2023. The first is there's been this persistent gap between supply and demand in terms of available capital. And clearly, some of that ameliorates as the industry earns good returns in 2023. But there's really fundamentally been no formation of new capital in the industry other than our equity raise. And so I think there's still that element. There's also a rising demand from our cedents to buy more limit, which we saw again in some of those new deals that came out. The second key factor, which I think is critical is underwriting psychology. The fact is the industry has been affected by multiple years of elevated loss activity that's hurt underwriters across the business. And they understand, I think, where you need to sustain rate momentum to earn good returns. And then the last thing is, if you look at the underlying loss trends, climate change, the impact of development patterns we're in an elevated CAT world. It's the new normal, and we saw it again this year. We had an elevated 2023 CAT year. So our view is that puts legs on this market, and our expectation remains that these terrific conditions will persist past the January 1/\u201925 renewal. In terms of risk remote layers, yes, I mean, look, there's interest there because I think people are trying to get away from all of the factors that I just described. We did see some cap on formation up in the towers that caps price increases. But as you saw in our portfolio, there's plenty of areas of these programs where we can continue to do exceptionally well. And so we see just tons of opportunity for us as we go forward. Gregory Peters : And just building on that answer. I was looking at Slide 16 of your investor deck where you talk about the risk profile and after-tax net 1 :100 year PML. Given some of the growth statistics you've thrown out in Property Cat. I guess I'm surprised that we haven't seen a bigger increase in your 1 :100 year sort of PML calculation. Give us a sense of what's going on there that's keeping it muted. Jim Williamson : Sure. Greg, Jim again. Yes, so a couple of things, and you would have heard us opine on this in prior calls, a couple of things moving there. First of all, the way we shaped our portfolio definitely has an impact on the shape of the curve and the shape of the PMLs. And so, one of the things that we did, for example, throughout 2023 was move up in programs and really get more remote in terms of our average attachment level. And I've talked about an average attachment that might have been in the 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 year range is now more like a 1 in 7, and that's very meaningful in terms of managing total risk profile. And so that's been very important. The other thing I would indicate, obviously, is we are growing our portfolio across the world. We see really terrific opportunities in markets in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America. So we don't have to over-lever ourselves to our existing peak zones. We can be diversified and get exceptional returns. And then the last thing I would note, obviously, is the company is growing. And so the capital base, the denominator of those 1 :100 calculations that you're referencing is getting larger as well, which gives us obviously capacity to prudently grow our portfolio. So if you were to look at on a dollar basis, our reported PMLs, you'll see growth. I think that growth is appropriate given the environment. I'd say gross PML growth is lower than net PML growth. As we've hedge last as Mark indicated in his comments, which means more retained profit for us. So we're really moving all of these dials to ensure superior returns as we move forward. Mark Kociancic : Greg, it's Mark. I'll just add another point to it. I do think that you will see a movement to the right on that slide that you're indicating where we'll take a bit more exposure to tail risk through the course of 2024 and probably beyond. We are becoming more of a gross underwriter. And so in addition to Jim's point on the expansion of capital, the portfolio is shaping, there will be less reliance on some of the hedging instruments as we move into more of a gross underwriting mindset but all within our risk appetite and only where we have significant margin expectations. And then the last point is we are benefiting from meaningful diversification in our Property Cat book as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : I've got two quick ones here. The first one, I'm just curious, back to the reserves and I apologize on the reinsurance side. You're not the only ones on the primary side, obviously, there's some taking to adverse development in the '16 through '19 years on the insurance side. I'm just curious, is the border rows come in from all these other companies that are taking reserve charges. Do you or have you taken into account that increase in the claims activity and severity that you're likely to see just from Border Rose coming in on reinsurance? Mark Kociancic : Yes. We're definitely, I think, ahead of the curve on that. That's something that we've had in our vision for quite some time. And we're prudently reserved clearly in '23, have been proving out. So we feel very good about our casualty reserve positioning in the reinsurance segment for those years and recent years. Jim Williamson : And Brian, it's Jim Williamson. The only thing I would add to that, I totally agree with what Mark said. But we're not waiting for border rows. We have very strong collaboration with our core cedents in terms of claim -- from a claims management perspective, we're getting signals much earlier than reported rose and that helps to stay on top of these trends and to ensure that we're building significant prudence into our quarterly loss base. Brian Meredith : And then second question, just curious, capital management. I mean, obviously, you've had a lot of fantastic organic growth opportunities here, you're really growing. But as I look at your stock right now, it's kind of come down and getting closer to some pretty attractive valuations. And what are thoughts on kind of using some of the capital that you're generating for share buyback? Mark Kociancic : Well, it's always a consideration, Brian. But we made this point last year. The underwriting opportunities are very lucrative, particularly in reinsurance. And we think we can capture a lot of in 2024, build our portfolio, build the franchise, and we can execute easily. So remunerating that capital is fundamental to achieving our Investor Day objectives. If we can't do that, yes, capital management is a tool that we can use to remunerate our shareholders more adequately, but we're very confident in our ability to achieve those objectives from Investor Day, deploy that capital profitably, build the franchises and get it done. There's a runway here for 2024, clearly and well into 2025. Juan Andrade : Yes, Brian, this is Juan. And I would echo what Mark said, look, from our perspective, buybacks are always there right after organic growth and something that we consider on a regular basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Just one for me. If we think about your 2024, 2025, 2026 objectives, let's say, social inflation continues to kind of nag. So there's -- in this area where there's a little bit of underlying loss ratio pressure at the group level. Are those objectives still achievable in your mind? And I guess, if not, you mentioned capital management, but are there other levers that you can pull to stay within that ROE range? Mark Kociancic : Ryan, it's Mark. Short answer is, yes. Very well-diversified set of lines of business that we have in both franchises to execute from. It goes back to my earlier point about the granular that we have in our portfolios so that we understand where loss trend is, what we think of social inflation exposure, medical inflation, economic inflation, et cetera, all the kind of risk factors that go into calculating the expected returns that we can get. And so when you've got that type of diversification, much easier to do cycle management and make sure that you're disciplined in allocating that capital over time. So lots of paths to do that. In terms of the social inflation aspect, I mean, it's well known, I think, in the industry. So we're obviously taking prudent loss picks into consideration as we price that business going forward. So we feel very good about the three year plan beginning '24 to '26. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Michael Zaremski : So back to the reserving discussion. You said I think, Juan, you might have said that you're making much higher loss -- taking much higher loss picks on the -- as of 2020 from looking back at the transcript wording. I don't believe, and maybe I'm incorrect your disclosure, many of your peers, you can see the disclosure, but I don't believe you Everest discloses loss tax side vintage or by major line of business. So unless I'm wrong, and you want to give some color on that, it would be great to understand how much higher those loss picks are or if you wanted to change the disclosure in the future kind of as many of your peers to disclose that. Juan Andrade : Yes, Mike, I'll start and then I'll have Mark add some commentary as well. Look, we don't disclose our loss picks, obviously, for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that, again, as I've said before, since I arrived here in the fall of 2019 and for the first plan that we did for 2020, we significantly increased our loss picks in both insurance and reinsurance, particularly on long-tail lines of business. And that is something that we look at every quarter. and we true up every quarter, and you have not been seeing us really take loss big staff, at least not since I've been here as CEO of this company. And the reason for that is everything that we have been talking about right now, right? Number one is the fact that we recognize that there is loss inflation in the environment. So that's one of the key reasons for increasing the loss picks and not taking them down. We also have been truing up our loss trend assumptions and we've been doing that on a very regular basis starting in 2020. So before inflation, economic inflation really started to happen, we started doing that really in 2020. So I think those two things really come back to what Mark and I were saying earlier in the conversation, which also gives us comfort as to where we are right now. In addition to that, and very importantly, it's all the risk management and portfolio management actions that we have taken across the book. You heard Mike Karmilowicz, for example, talk about the fact that in lines like ex liability, where we might have had $25 million limits exposed back in 2018, 2019, they're down to $10 million now, and it's actually a net of $5 million for us in the company. So significantly lower. And that's across every single line of business that's out there. So when you take into account the increased loss picks, the increased rate, the additional loss trend is put up, the rate and the portfolio management actions, the risk selection, et cetera, all of this comes together. And essentially, the conclusion that we're giving you today on how we feel about that go-forward business and the fact that we have dealt with the 2016 to 2019 years. Michael Zaremski : That's helpful, especially the reminding us about the limits changes on lots of the policies in '20 and beyond. Let me -- just lastly, I don't know if -- just looking at the -- you've taken a lot of realized losses make sense to kind of lock in some higher yields and some reserve changes, too, a lot of premium growth, which is -- which uses up capital. So just is there -- should we be thinking about just being careful with our buyback assumptions on a go-forward basis given all the moving parts? Or should we -- am I splitting hairs and that you can keep kind of at the current pace? Mark Kociancic : Mike, it's Mark. The first point that I would make is we have ample capital. There's a lot of capital that we have at our disposal -- the capital raise that we did last year, fully deployed, we've generated an additional $1.5 billion in the second half of 2023. I think we've also got very favorable margin expectations for 2024 and beyond. And so the ability to generate income and retained earnings going forward, we feel very bullish about. And then you've got process that we have internally where there's the -- and I think this is really important, there's a discipline of what I call threshold pricing where we are able to move into the most accretive opportunities. We are not forced to simply underwrite certain lines or classes of business to keep volume or whatever it is. It's very much a profit focus. And so the attractiveness of what we see in this environment for underwriting expansion is driving everything. Capital management, I think that's a secondary tool. There's nothing that would restrict it. It's simply not as privileged given these opportunities that we have now. And the main point here is that with all this ample capital and capital generation ability. If we're not able to remunerate that satisfactorily to our TSR objectives. Yes, then I think you'll see more to management levers being pulled, but there's nothing stopping that conceptually. It's simply the opportunity set that we have in front of us that we want to pursue and capture. Operator : And our next question comes from Jing Li with KBW. Jing Li : The first question on that you mentioned in the block on the return on the casualty book. Just wondering like how big was and what's left on these books? Are they in majority GL book? Juan Andrade : Yes. So on the two items that we mentioned for general liability and frankly, what's creating some of the issue that we're proactively addressing right now. I would say one of those programs has been completely shut off at this point in time. And then second book has been remediated, re-underwritten very little new business coming into that at this point in time. But I don't know Mike Karmilowicz, if you want to add a little bit of color to that. Mike Karmilowicz : Yes. It's basically a couple of $100 million. And these were actually dealt with over the last 18 to 24 months. So we proactively got in front of it. And again, I think that gets back to the point you made around active and portfolio management. Jing Li : Just one more follow-up on the market. How attractive do you guys think is for the market looking post reform? Jim Williamson : Yes. This is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Our stance has been pretty consistent in that. We thought the government of Florida, the legislator did a very good job in the structuring of those reforms. Early indications in terms of communication with our clients in Florida and other stakeholders in the state would suggest that the reforms are doing what they were intended to do. But we also said that we would be waiting for the results of those reforms to show up in our data before determining what that means for our underwriting position. So our approach to Florida has been quite consistent over the last couple of years. We are a meaningful provider capacity to the state -- and as long as our expectation for risk-adjusted returns are met, which would mean at least as good or improved from last year, meaning excellent, we'll continue to provide that capacity. Obviously, if that isn't the case, we would do less. And if conditions get even better, we might do a little bit more. But I don't expect a major change at the upcoming June 1 renewal. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Juan Andrade : So thank you for the great dialogue and all the questions on the actions that we took in the quarter. I do think it's important to zoom out and keep things in context, right? If you look at the 2023 results for the company, they were simply outstanding. 23% operating ROE, total shareholder return over 26%. And if you exclude the Bermuda DTA action, you're still generating an operating ROE of 19% and a TSR of 21%. So simply world-class results. You also heard a commentary on the 1/1 renewals, which were excellent. That gives us pretty significant tailwind going into 2024. Not a great discussion on the reserves. And I think hopefully, the takeaway that you have here is we have a strong reserve position. We feel confident about where we are. And then lastly, as Mark and I both said, we are confident in achieving our Investor Day targets. We have lots of levers to achieve our objectives. So with that, I look forward talking to you after our Q1 results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Matthew Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Everest Group Limited First Quarter of 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest Management team.  Before we begin, I'll preface the comments on today's call by noting that Everest SEC filings include extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in our earnings release and financial supplement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Carlos Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a strong start to 2024. Our first quarter results included record underwriting profit and significant increases in operating income, net income and investment income. This resulted in a total shareholder return exceeding 18% and an operating return on equity of 20%.  We drove margin expansion through rate increases that are meaningfully in excess of loss trend, targeted risk selection, portfolio and cycle management, exposure growth and with underwriting discipline. We accomplished this while consistently and purposely maintaining conservatism in our loss space. We are confident in how we have shaped our portfolio.  In reinsurance, we built on our preferred lead market position at the January 1 renewals and continue to distinguish Everest in the accelerating flight to quality. Our Reinsurance portfolio is well positioned and driving strong risk-adjusted returns.  In Insurance, we advanced our disciplined expansion in targeted markets while remaining focused on prudent risk selection and the bottom line. We are focused on our primary objective of delivering consistent, leading financial returns. With the 3-year strategic plan, we laid out during November 2023 Investor Day, Everest has entered a new chapter of profitable growth and opportunity, and we are well positioned for the future with a focused strategy and great talent.  Now I'll turn to the first quarter financial highlights, beginning with our group results. We delivered $709 million in net operating income, a 60% increase from the prior year. Gross written premium increased by over 17% in constant dollars. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based and reflects Everest's diversification by segment, geography, business line and distribution. Growth was supported by best-in-class execution and our ability to take advantage of market conditions in Reinsurance and Insurance, particularly in property and specialty lines.  Our underwriting performance was strong in the first quarter. We delivered $409 million in underwriting profit. The group combined ratio was 88.8%, a significant improvement from last year. This is despite the industry incurring approximately $20 billion in catastrophe losses in the quarter. For Everest, pretax catastrophe losses, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums were $85 million or just 2.3 points, a year-over-year decrease directly resulting from our portfolio optimization efforts. Everest catastrophe losses were primarily driven by the Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse in Baltimore. With regard to investments, we generated net investment income of $457 million, a new quarterly record.  Now turning to our Reinsurance business. Reinsurance delivered significant top and bottom line growth. Our success at the January 1 renewal gave us a running start to the year, delivering a higher quality, higher-margin portfolio. We grew the Reinsurance business in the first quarter, over 20% on a constant dollar basis, with $3.2 billion in gross written premiums.  We increased underwriting profit to $345 million, with an 87.3% combined ratio. The attritional loss ratio and attritional combined ratio also improved to 57.2% and 84.4%, respectively. This quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $80 million, net of estimated recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Both rate and terms and conditions remained at attractive levels, resulting in a portfolio that should continue to achieve excellent risk-adjusted returns.  We grew our total property portfolio significantly, building on meaningful increases in 2023. We expanded our portfolio in attractive specialty lines of business, particularly marine and aviation. We remain disciplined and surgical in our approach to certain casualty lines. Our responsiveness, creativity and constructive approach to the market once again set Everest apart. We deepened relationships with top-tier clients globally while capturing incremental demand and growing share on oversubscribed deals.  We continued this positive momentum through the April renewals, resulting in high-quality, broad-based growth, particularly in property lines and excellent overall risk-adjusted returns. We capitalized on strong demand, expanding with core cedents, while also growing with targeted new partners. Consistent with the January renewal, we maintained discipline in certain casualty lines, nonrenewing business that did not meet our thresholds. Overall, the market remains disciplined and trading conditions continue to be favorable, particularly in property and specialty lines. We continue to see incremental demand from cedents, and we are leaning into these opportunities. We expect risk-adjusted returns to remain attractive through upcoming renewals and into 2025.  Now turning to insurance. We continue to unlock value in our primary insurance business, making solid strides in bringing our capabilities to new markets globally. We grew the Insurance segment by 10% in constant dollars and generated over $1.2 billion in premiums for the quarter. Growth was diversified with 37% growth in property and 36% in specialty lines such as aviation, energy, surety and marine. We see strong rate and terms and conditions in these lines.  Also, due to strong rate increases, we saw modest growth in some casualty lines. With a consistent emphasis on profitability, we focused on lines of business with favorable pricing and strong profit trajectories. We achieved a 12% rate increase across the portfolio, excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. Loss trends in casualty remain elevated but they're stable and pricing continues to meaningfully outpace that trend.  We continue to see rate acceleration across casualty lines excluding financial lines. This was most pronounced in commercial auto liability, general liability and excess casualty lines. The rate increases in these 3 lines average mid-teens overall. The combined ratio at 93.1% resulted in an underwriting profit of $64 million. The attritional loss ratio was 64%, reflecting our discipline and continued loss pick conservatism in casualty lines of business.  We also continued our proactive shift or short-tail lines, which we expect will benefit underlying margins throughout the remainder of the year. As I've said in the past, we will recognize bad news quickly, and the good news from our positive portfolio rate actions will season over time. We are focused on profitably growing in geographies and lines of business we find attract while continuing to drive rate in excess of loss trend. Our first quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of Everest franchise and the results of our actions over the past 4 years. We see significant opportunities for our underwriting businesses globally, and trading conditions remain favorable. I'm excited about the journey ahead for our business and our ability to continue delivering leading financial returns.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest is off to a strong start to 2024. We delivered significant growth in underwriting income, net investment income, operating income and net income for the first quarter. This drove operating EPS of $16.32, and an operating ROE of 20%. The annualized TSR or total shareholder return was strong at 18.1% despite modest foreign exchange headwinds. The company's strong performance in the first quarter was led by our team's high level of execution and ability to capitalize on attractive opportunities. We have significant momentum behind us across both of our franchises driven by excellent outcomes at recent renewals and our disciplined insurance expansion into target global markets.  Looking at the group results. Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.4 billion, representing 17.2% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 88.8% for the quarter, driven by an improved underlying loss ratio and lower Cat losses. The CAT losses in the quarter were largely driven by the Baltimore bridge collapse, which contributed $70 million to Cat losses. The group attritional loss ratio was 58.9% and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement. The group's commission ratio was 21.4%, consistent with the prior year. The group expense ratio improved 30 basis points to 6.1% in the quarter, an excellent result as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises.  Moving to the segment results and starting with Reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 20.4% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was consistent with the trends seen throughout the prior year with strong and broad-based growth in property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in certain casualty lines.  Property lines grew 31% in the quarter, while casualty lines grew 11% in the quarter, and we continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short-tail lines, which now stands at 54% property and 46% casualty versus 50% property and 50% casualty in the prior year. Growth will continue to favor short-tail business as we trend throughout the year, which will be more pronounced on an earned basis. The combined ratio was 87.3% an improvement of 350 basis points from the prior year. The attritional loss ratio improved 80 basis points to 57.2% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms particularly in property and specialty lines. The attritional combined ratio improved 150 basis points to 84.4% during the quarter.  Both the commission ratio and underwriting expense ratio improved modestly to 24.6% and 2.6% in the quarter, respectively.  Moving to Insurance. Gross premiums written grew approximately 10% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. We continue to methodically scale our primary franchise globally while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short-tail specialty lines. The growth in casualty and professional lines was driven by rate increases as a number of lines saw continued price acceleration in the quarter.  The attritional loss ratio stood at 64% this quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior year. The commission ratio was consistent with the prior year, while the underwriting related expense ratio increased to 16.6%, driven by the continued investment in our global platform.  Moving on to investments. Net investment income increased nearly $200 million year-over-year to $457 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management and higher new money yields versus maturing assets. Alternative assets generated $74 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to rebound.  Our overall book yield improved from 3.8% to 4.7% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains north of 5%, which is in excess of maturing security yields. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.4 years given the attractive level of short rates.  The investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment and is supported by the compounding effect of strong underwriting income and cash flow. Our high-quality portfolio is built to generate strong returns on a consistent basis. For the first quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 12.2%, which was broadly in line with our working assumption for the year. Our capital strength gives us ample capacity for 2024 and positions us well for profitable organic growth. We opportunistically repurchased 90,000 shares in the quarter, amounting to $35 million with an average of $387.64 per share. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.6 billion or $14.5 billion when excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities.  At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $876 million, an increase of $153 million as compared to the end of the fourth quarter, resulting from interest rate increases. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $313.55, an improvement of 3.6% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $1.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $333.70 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 4%.  Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 15.8%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis.  In conclusion, Everest had an excellent start to the year. Market fundamentals remain attractive and we have strong momentum across both underwriting franchises.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to 1 question plus 1 follow up, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I just had a question on the premium growth in property Cat. I was a little surprised at the 4% growth, I thought it would have been more than that, just given how attractive market conditions are. Could you elaborate on what you're seeing and it looks like you may have shifted a little bit more towards property pro rata. Maybe just talk about why you chose to grow that instead of a property Cat. James Williamson : Sure, David, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question.  First of all, just on the property Cat XOL growth that you're seeing printed in the quarter, that's really a premium recognition timing phenomena. And so if you look back at the June 2023 property Cat renewal, which was the Florida renewal, that was really the only renewal last year that we did not grow. And so you're seeing that roll through the numbers in this quarter. All of the other renewal dates that we've experienced recently have shown strong growth.  And just to give you some of that perspective, at the January 1 renewal of this year, we grew our property Cat business by 24%, which was just excellent. We did that at outstanding risk-adjusted returns. And then we were able to continue that growth at the April 1 renewal, where we grew globally just about 10% and in our North America property business, we grew property Cat by 76%, again, at outstanding risk-adjusted economics.  So it's a little bit of a blip that way. My expectation, obviously, is it will work itself out as we go forward.  In terms of the property pro rata part of your question, it's really not a matter of saying, okay, we now like property pro rata better than property Cat XOL for the reasons I just described. What it is, is it's starting really in the back half of last year, we saw just terrific economics in the primary property market, particularly in the E&S space in North America. We leaned into that with our core clients and wrote bigger lines with some of the best underwriters in the market, and that's now flowing into our financials, and we're picking it up in meaningful growth this quarter.  And then the other major contributor to pro rata property growth is the expansion of our business in Asia, where we've traditionally been underweight. We're growing very nicely again with best-in-class underwriters in that market. And that market does tend to be more of a pro rata market and very much a property market. And so you're seeing the effects of selecting some really outstanding deals in the Asia market. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. Thanks for that clarification on the property Cat growth. I appreciate it. And then maybe, Juan, just on the attritional loss ratio in the Insurance business. So I caught that you're expecting that to come down over the course of the rest of the year as you shift to more short-tail lines or that should benefit underlying margins throughout the remainder of the year.  Could you just elaborate on that a little bit and just maybe talk about what drove the 64% this quarter? I think you mentioned conservatism, but I was just wondering if you could just talk about that and maybe also what sort of impact that has on your view of the 2020 through 2023 accident year, if at all? Juan Carlos Andrade : Yes. This is Juan. Let me start and then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to add some color as well. I think the most important thing is, really start with sort of the framework, right? So we have been essentially running between the 63% and 64% attritional loss ratio in insurance over the past 2 years. And so there's a couple of things. One, in every quarter, you're going to have some timing and mix noise, but the fundamentals to our approach have remained consistent. And that's really the fact that we have been very disciplined underwriters and we continue to remain conservative with our loss picks for casualty lines in both divisions, not only in Insurance and this is something that we have talked about in prior venues.  So we're holding our loss picks longer across all lines of business even if we see favorable loss experience in any given quarter and we're going to continue to do that in a very disciplined and systematic manner. And so that's basically what you're seeing as far as the 64% here in the quarter. But let me ask Mark to add a little bit more on that. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Juan, just a couple of things to add to the equation. So in addition to the conservatism and the prudence of the lost fix, we feel very good about the margin that we're building in the lines that we're writing. We're obviously tracking loss trend, give you a couple of high-level points on that. Essentially, it's been elevated for a while, for several quarters, but stable, broadly stable, and rate has been meaningfully in excess of trends. So we feel good. No issue on our side to have the extra, what we would call, level of prudence in those loss picks given the loss environment that Juan spoke about and I spoke about during the Investor Day.  I do think mix of business will eventually push the loss ratio mechanically lower as we had a bit more short-tail lines to the mix overall. And that should happen throughout the year and a little bit more over time over the 3-year plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : Juan, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for midyear renewals. We're hearing some signs from brokers that there's ample capacity and maybe we're seeing property Reinsurance pricing kind of peaking out. Is that your perspective on things? Juan Carlos Andrade : So sure, Brian. Let me get started, and I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit of extra color on all of this.  Look, I think as we've said, both in my prepared remarks and in Jim's question -- answer to David a few minutes ago, we had a terrific 1/1 renewal and we had an excellent 4/1 renewal. So at this point in time, we got close to 70% of our book that's been renewed at what we believe are excellent risk-adjusted returns. The market for us continues to be pretty good. If you think about it from a pricing perspective, you would expect some of the pricing to moderate, given that we've had rate on rate on rate, particularly in some of these geographies over time. But I think more importantly is the fact that attachment points and terms and conditions have continued to hold. And I think that is a critical point to keep in mind going forward for the future.  The other thing is what I said in my prepared remarks, which is our competitors remain disciplined. So the trading conditions from that perspective continue to be favorable. But let me ask Jim to give a little bit more color on how he views Florida at 6/1, and then some of the 7/1 renewals as well. James Williamson : Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Just to maybe reinforce some of the points Juan made, which I think are spot on. We have seen really terrific results from the most recent renewals, including April. And you would certainly have expected, given how much rate the market took last year, that more underwriters are going to be interested in writing the business. And while that's true, we've also seen just a floor under the discipline that people are applying to this market, which is what's sustaining terms and conditions, keeping risk-adjusted rate on the upward trajectory, which is resulting in the economics that we find so attractive. The other thing to keep in mind is we're still experiencing elevated losses around the world. And while we had a terrific Q1 Cat result, the fact is Cats remain elevated, whether it's weather, earthquake, man-made disasters, et cetera, those things are happening, and I think that's keeping a focus on the discipline that the market is pursuing. And then the other factor to keep an eye on is we see some really strong increasing demand from some of our best clients. And given Everest's position as a preferred and lead market, we have opportunities to deploy incremental capacity at really attractive rates. And I think that's happening both at the major renewals but also between those renewals. And there's a lot more in that pipeline that I think will help to sustain the market.  And so our perspective is, as we roll into the rest of 2024 with Florida renewal in June and then the 7/1 renewal, primarily driven by Australia, we expect discipline to be maintained, risk-adjusted economics should be terrific. And then I would further say that our expectation remains that, that will continue into 2025. Brian Meredith : That's really helpful. And then I just wanted to pivot back to the Insurance underlying, call it loss ratio just quickly here. I know that last year, you had some mid stop loss one-offs. So year-over-year, it looks like about 150 basis points up year-over-year. But I'm just curious, how much of maybe that conservatism you've built in is due to perhaps financial lines and workers' comp? I know you gave us a rate of 12x financial lines and comp. I'm curious, was that your -- you put everything all in. And if that is one of the contributing factors to the year-over-year increase? Mark Kociancic : Yes. Brian, it's Mark. I don't think it is. I think workers' comp is broadly stable in the last few years. So that's not driving it. You're right, we had 100 -- roughly 150 basis points of delta last year because of A&H. There is a bit of mix that drove the delta from last year down to something that was sub-63% attritional loss ratio. But I'd say our run rate is more in the 63% to 64% range. And I think what you're seeing here is just a mix of business that is skewed a bit more to longer-tail casualty, and we're keeping those loss picks at a healthy level, a prudent level on our side. Brian Meredith : Do you have the all-in number for kind of what rate looked like in the first quarter when you include financial and comp? Juan Carlos Andrade : Yes, that would be about a little bit over 7%. Operator : And our next question is coming from Michael Zaremski from BMO. Michael Zaremski : Follow-up on the primary insurance pricing. I think you might have answered part of this, but so the rates have accelerated in social inflation, I guess, associated lines and the decelerated in property, I think, is how -- what kept the kind of the math flat at 12%. On the social inflationary lines, do you feel that there's still kind of momentum in the marketplace potentially as the year progresses? Or is kind of the jump up into the low to mid-teens, is that a kind of -- is that a very healthy level to kind of protect against what looks like to be an inching higher of social inflationary trends? Juan Carlos Andrade : Yes, Mike, this is Juan. So let me give you a little bit of perspective, and I think you can break it down sort of into different lines. If I look at, for example, commercial auto liability, we have seen essentially rate trend up over, frankly, the last 5 quarters or so with a pretty consistent basis. General liability has done the same for about the last 4 quarters, [ umbrella ] and excess for about the last 3 quarters, right? So that gives you a sense that this is -- it's a trend, right? It's not a fluke, per se, just 1 quarter over the other. And look, I think the issues in the industry are well known. It's something that, obviously, we have discussed with all of you, competitors have discussed with all of you. So I would expect that, that continues through the rest of 2024. Again, it's 4 to 5 quarters, depending on the line of business that you continue to see that momentum. When I look at property, there's certainly been a bit more capacity that's come in, particularly into the E&S market, and we saw that in the first quarter. But the pricing is still good and it's still significantly adequate in an excess of loss trend. So we still feel very good about the property business on the primary side of things as well. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Got it. An encouraging trend on the liability side, given what we're seeing. I believe my follow-up in the prepared remarks, I think, Jim Williamson said that property Cat grew by 24%, I believe. Is that -- I feel like when we're looking at the disclosure in the earnings release, we see a much lower number for Cat XOL? Am I thinking about something incorrectly? James Williamson : Yes, Mike, this is Jim. Yes, the -- an earlier question was about the fact that we had printed a lower Cat growth number. You would have seen about a 4% growth number on Cat XOL. And what I had indicated is that's really the impact of the recognition of written premium flowing through the first quarter financials, which included a renewal last year, the June 23 renewal where we actually chose to step back a bit on Florida because of the stringent -- our own stringent financial underwriting approach. And so now that's kind of flowing into the financials. What I further commented on is that at the January 1 renewal, we grew our property Cat XOL business by 24% for the renewal at really terrific risk-adjusted economics. And then further said, we did also very well at the April renewal, growing about 11% overall, we grew our North America property business at 4/1 by 76%. And so just outstanding growth rates and you'll see that show up in future quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : A lot of property questions. So on the big pro rata growth, can you talk about what that means for your exposures and how that affects your capital utilization? James Williamson : Sure, Josh. This is Jim. So a couple of things. One, if you look at our gross PML and then further our net PMLs as they've trajected over the last several renewals, they're up modestly. I would say that's being driven more by taking advantage of the property Cat XOL market. We've been pretty cautious on how much Cat exposure we're taking in the property pro rata book. Obviously, it exists, but we're being thoughtful about that balance.  I would further say, there's no constraint, given our available capacity, where we are relative to our risk appetite, as you would have seen in the investor presentation, we still have plenty of room to maneuver. And so there's not going to be a point where -- the fact that we've taken advantage of some really exciting opportunities in the property pro rata space, where we then can't go and grow where we want to with key clients on the property Cat XOL, that is definitely not a trade-off we're making. And we would not disadvantage the Cat book for any other opportunity. Joshua Shanker : And capital utilization? James Williamson : Are you referring in terms of how we put the capital to work? Joshua Shanker : Yes. As you've grown that book, does that -- obviously, more efficiently, I guess, it is capital. Does that -- is there a binding constraint on how much of this property pro rata you can write? Mark Kociancic : No. Josh, it's Mark. The answer is no. Despite the large level of growth, very manageable full degrees of freedom to underwrite as we see in the market going forward. No issue on that side. Joshua Shanker : And then switching gears to casualty reinsurance. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of incurred loss activity versus claims as disclosed by your customers on the reinsurance side for the older accident years as they deal with social inflation? Have they taken their picks up enough? Or are you -- do you think that they're playing a game of sort of catch-up based on picks that you've set in the space? James Williamson : Yes, Josh, it's Jim again. Look, I'm not going to comment on the approach that other companies are taking to lost pick selection. What I would say is -- and this is true of older accident years and more recent accident years. We take a very prudent approach to ultimate loss ratio selection. We certainly did that over the last few years as we've strengthened reserves in reinsurance casualty. You saw us do that. We took a very conservative approach to how we set those ultimate loss ratios and put ourselves in a position to ensure that, that's in the rearview mirror. And then we do the same thing on more recent accident years, which, in some cases, means that we have a different view of the ultimate loss ratio that our clients have. And you would have heard us describe in the last earnings call that we stepped back from some casualty in the -- at the January 1 renewal. We reduced our expiring book by about 15% due to portfolio management actions. And in many cases, that was due to the fact that we had our own independent view of the expected loss pick, and that may have been higher than what our clients expected. So we're absolutely applying our own disciplines and analytics to what others are reporting, whether they're reporting in their financials or reporting it to us in their submissions and we think that puts us in good stead. Operator : And now we have a question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Sorry to follow up again on the property Cat question, but just going back to the 4% reported growth. And Jim, I know you said that the property Cat XOL book grew 24%, sorry at 1/1. I understand that debt premium earn lags as you write business. I just didn't, I guess, appreciate that there's a lag on a gross or net premiums written basis on business that you would have written in the middle of last year. Can you just, I guess, just kind of explain that just that concept to me, just like the lag on the written that would, I guess, flow through 6 months later? James Williamson : Yes. Sure, Elyse. It's Jim. Yes, we've recognized written. We don't recognize written premium on a reinsurance contract the way you might on a primary insurance contract where you recognize all of the written premium in the period that you originally incepted the deal. Instead, the written recognition of premium is spread out. In the case of property Cat, it would typically be over a 4-quarter period, whereas something like casualty pro rata is typically recognized over an 8-quarter period and you don't recognize all the premium in a straight line, particularly for casualty pro rata. And you may recall earlier in the year and last year, we talked a lot about this relative to the recognition of growth from the Jan 1, 2023 renewal relative to casualty. And so there are going to be these effects. But as I indicated earlier, we're seeing -- we've seen strong growth pretty much at every renewal since January of 2023 and actually going back into June of '22, as the market started to correct. The only renewal that we've had in that entire time that showed a reduction was the June 2023 renewal because we stepped back a bit in Florida because a lot of smaller clients weren't able to meet our quite stringent financial underwriting approach. So to give you some statistics, we talked about January '24, July '23 almost 25% growth, April '23, 30% growth. Jan '23, almost 50% growth. And it was only June '23, where we actually reduced the book by about 2.3%. So it just gives you a sense of the fact that we are delivering strong growth at terrific economics at all of these renewals. Got a little bit of a blip in this quarter and we expect that to correct. Now the other thing I would indicate, of course, as you'll see in the financials is earned premium for Cat XOL was up almost 20%, which is much more consistent with what you might expect. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then on the -- on the capital side, you guys started to buy back a little bit of your stock this quarter. I think you used the word opportunistic around that. So can you just give us a sense of just kind of capital return thoughts from here just balancing growth? And I guess, obviously, as we get closer to win season? Mark Kociancic : Elyse, it's Mark. So you're right. We did start some modest share buybacks in the first quarter, really no change from what we've been saying all along. We're privileging the organic growth, no reason we can't do capital management actions like share buybacks. At the same time, we demonstrated that in March and no reason it won't continue going forward, it's an attractive level. Operator : And our next question comes from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Charles Peters : So for the first question, I'm going to pivot back to the TSR target that you guys have rolled out. And I'm just curious if there's been an updated view on the risks to hitting your TSA target -- TSR target, excuse me. And in that regard, I was looking at your slide deck, and I noticed your -- you disclosed your 1 :100 PMLs. I'm wondering how that might look when we get to [ 7/1/24 ]? Mark Kociancic : So it's -- Greg, it's Mark talking. Let me kind of split this into 2 pieces of PMLs and TSR, ways of getting there. So back in the Investor Day, one of the points that I made during the presentation was that we had lots of different avenues to achieving leading financial returns as measured by total shareholder return. So it doesn't matter really from our standpoint, if there's pluses and minuses coming from different underwriting markets, pricing and rate. We have a very well-developed and diversified set of franchises to manage cycle management, portfolio management and really drive growth of the franchise, combined with strong investment income. That's unchanged in terms of achieving the target that we set out. PMLs, I'll hand it over to Jim and maybe I'll add a little bit of color at the end. James Williamson : Yes. Greg, it's Jim. So referencing your question and the PMLs that you would have seen in the investor presentation. So a couple of things. One, look, the peak zones that are represented there, we certainly have seen a little bit of growth in our net PMLs from July of last year to 1/1 this year. That's a couple of factors. One, we've taken advantage of the market as I've talked about on this call, and we've grown our portfolio at great economics, which is fantastic. We've also optimized our hedging and we're taking more of our Cat risk on a net basis, and that's contributed to the growth in the net PMLs. Now those particular peak zones that are featured in the investor presentation. We'll see a little bit more growth, I would expect in Southeast wind through the June renewal, assuming that Florida pricing terms and conditions hold, which we expect.  California quake is pretty much in the bag for the year, where you will see us continue to lean into the market at the 7/1 renewal is outside of our peak zones. And so we have plenty of capacity, both in our PMLs and our capital and really any other way you want to think about risk to continue to grow. And I think that's best illustrated by the other exhibit on that page, which shows our earnings and capital at risk and our current position. And you see there that we're -- we have plenty of room to maneuver within our stated risk appetite to take advantage of great market conditions and grow where we need to. Juan Carlos Andrade : Greg, this is Juan. And I would just essentially reinforce 2 points that Mark and Jim have made. So number one, we absolutely see no change to the 17% target. And you see where we started the year at the 18.1%. But I think the second point is probably more critical one, which is the one Jim just made that we are well within our Cat underwriting appetite. And so that gives us confidence to be able to maneuver and frankly keep growing the property Cat book, given the, frankly, the excellent risk-adjusted returns that we're seeing in that book right now. Charles Peters : I guess, my follow-up question, just more specific. Can you talk a little bit about how the facultative market is evolving because sort of hearing mixed messages out of the market and value your perspective on that. James Williamson : Sure, Greg. It's Jim again. Yes. So in terms of facultative, we had a terrific quarter in our facultative business. We were able to grow that business very nicely, about 14% over prior year. And that's really on the back of significant demand by our cedents. And in particular, in short tail lines where they had to increase their Cat XOL attachment points last year to manage the market cycle. That means that, in some cases, they're feeling exposed on larger risks. Their per-risk limits might be uncomfortable. And so they're coming to Everest to try to manage that exposure. And so we're getting really great results that we're excited about and I expect we'll continue to lean into. That said, like all parts of this business, we need to be very thoughtful in our risk management approach. And so there are parts of the portfolio, none of this would surprise you, where we're being very cautious and very prudent. And certainly, commercial auto would be an area where we're being prudent. We've pretty much exited or significantly reduced any exposure to professional or financial lines. We're being very careful about limit deployment in excess casualty. So we are writing some terrific deals there, but we're being careful about limits, obviously, ensuring we're getting paid adequately. So like any business, whether it's reinsurance or primary insurance, need to manage the cycle carefully, but we continue to see really strong opportunities in fact. Operator : And our next question is coming from Bob Jian Huang from Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : So first question is on reserving. So looking at the last year's reserve charge, a large portion of that came from the accident year 2016 to 2019 cohort. I understand that you will probably do more reserve studies later on in the year. But just curious if there are any new developments or update at this particular point regarding the current reserving positions and as well as that 2016 to 2019 cohort as well? Mark Kociancic : Bob, it's Mark. So we did do our Q1 quarterly review process. It's quite comprehensive. You're right, no real reserve studies to go through in the first quarter, but plenty of anecdotal data that we're looking at, all kinds of information.  And so after we did a review of not only those years, but really across the board, we don't see anything that's altered our view of our reserve portfolio. So steady as she goes. Jian Huang : Got it. That's very helpful. Second one is more of a modeling question. So I understand that your expense ratio for the Insurance segment was elevated a little bit due to international build-out. How should we think about maybe a near-term run rate on this? Is this something that will persist for next few quarters, next few years? Is there a good way to think about the expense element on the Insurance segment? Mark Kociancic : Bob, it's Mark again. So I think it will be elevated for several quarters. So we're adding talent, technology. The premium, as you can see, is growing meaningfully. The earned is trailing and obviously earns in over time. And so we're still in a process of scaling. And you can see, just in the Q1 comparatives, we're coming in for the insurance division of 16.6% expense ratio versus something closer to 15% a year ago. So our North American operations are fairly stable in the expense ratio. The international is what's got this trailing effect. The good thing on our side is the -- I think the growth is quite accretive. We're seeing very nice technical ratios from the business that we're writing there, diversifies well, good margins that are embedded. So -- and we like the pace that we're going at. So I can see that being elevated for several quarters, but eventually trending down as the scale starts to catch up with the size of the foundation we're building. Juan Carlos Andrade : Bob, this is Juan. Let me add a couple of comments as well to what Mark just said. I think one important thing to keep in mind is really the hallmark expense discipline of Everest. And if you look at the group expense ratio really at that low 6% range, 6.1%,  6.2%, we've been able to maintain that throughout the entire build-out of that international component because of our expense discipline and our ability to prioritize things that matter and say no to things that don't. So I think that is something you can expect for the company going forward is that we continue to have one of the most competitive expense ratios in the industry, and that, frankly, is not going to change as we invest and build and grow the international component. Operator : And next in question is Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Unknown Analyst : This is Andrew on for Yaron. Within Insurance, it sounds like there could be some benefit on the underlying loss ratio for the remainder of the year. But does the guide of 90% to 92% for reported combined for full year '24 still stand, considering the reported 93% this quarter? Mark Kociancic : Yes, Andrew, it's Mark. The short answer is yes. I think there are several factors that are going towards that. You heard me in the previous question speak to some of the scaling benefits that we expect to get, particularly from the insurance franchise. So there are several factors, tailwinds that we have that I think will help us achieve that range.  I would start with -- we've got a mix that's going to trend a little bit more short-tail in terms of its proportion to the overall book that will come with lower combined ratios. You're still seeing very strong margin that's being added to the portfolio across the board as we cycle manage through the different opportunities that we have.  The expense ratio, really the 2 points. So the earned is going to grow more quickly on the international side as it trails the gross written. So that's going to help mechanically when you do the math. And then the expenses as a whole, I think given the fact we've spent over a year, well over a year building the foundation, those benefits are going to start to pay off and expenses will start to level out as an overall ratio.  So those factors overall are what's going to drive us back into that 92%, 90% range. Unknown Analyst : And maybe on Reinsurance, some strong growth within casualty pro rata and casualty XOL. Could you talk about some of the opportunities there this quarter? Juan Carlos Andrade : Yes. So let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Jim. This is Juan, Andrew. So I think 2 things drove particularly that casualty pro rata. Again, some of it is the timing of the business that was written at 1/1/23 last year. And I think Jim has talked a little bit about how the earnings pattern on that business works. So I think that's an important part of that. And we felt good about the pricing for that business as well. The second part of it is we saw some attractive opportunities in both Canada and Europe, outside of the United States where you don't have the social inflation issues that you have in the U.S. But Jim, maybe you can provide a little bit of additional color? James Williamson : Yes, I think that's right. It is on the pro rata side, it is largely timing of recognition. As we had indicated after the January 1, 2023 renewal, we earn casualty pro rata or I should say, recognized written premium over 8 quarters. And it's really in the middle of that period that you see the largest recognition of premium. And so we're in that period. We had really strong printed numbers last quarter on Cat's pro rata, same this quarter, et cetera. And there have been incremental opportunities, as Juan indicated. And in particular, when those are taking place outside the U.S. and in a very balanced way, we're more than happy to lean in to those opportunities. On the XOL side, not an entirely different story. I mean, we have chosen to grow in a targeted way with some of our top cedents. But the other thing that you'll see in that line, in particular, which is a relatively small part of our portfolio is that the amount of rate that will be flowing through in that line is going to be elevated. That's our expectation, and that certainly helps to support the growth numbers that you're seeing in the quarter. Operator : And next, we have a question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Unknown Analyst : It's Jean on for Meyer. I have a question on the professional line growth, kind of accelerated from 9.9% in 4Q. So instead of 11.7%, you mentioned rate acceleration. Are you guys expecting more if rates continue? Can you give more color on that, please? James Williamson : Yes, it's Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Actually, for the most part, the acceleration you would have seen some of the growth in professional lines for the quarter in our Insurance business was really related to one large fronting arrangement in our Canadian operation. So it's not really a general trend that you can apply to the rest of our business. Juan Carlos Andrade : Yes. The only other comment I would make and this is Juan, is [ freight ] also had some implications into that as well. But the growth that you're seeing is really what Jim has described, is that fronting deal in Canada. Unknown Analyst : Got you. So we don't expect that to continue for the rest of the year? Juan Carlos Andrade : No, I don't think we would expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Again, that was due to just one specific deal in Canada. Unknown Analyst : Okay. Got it. Just one more question, just a board question on Reinsurance. Just curious, can you share any plans for buying reinsurance for the Insurance segment? James Williamson : Yes. Sure. It's Jim Williamson again. Yes, we've been a pretty consistent buyer of reinsurance for our Insurance business. There are a lot of good reasons to procure reinsurance, obviously, it helps us to manage volatility within that line. In a number of cases, particularly our pro rata treaties in North America are quite accretive from a ceding commission perspective. So I think that strategy of using reinsurance strategically to manage our exposure and our economics will continue. I would expect, as the business matures both in North America and then, of course, over time in our international business, you could expect our net to gross ratio to increase as we retain more of our business. But I think those changes will be modest and will occur gradually over time. So I wouldn't expect any near-term changes in our approach that way. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for some closing remarks. Please go ahead. Juan Carlos Andrade : Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion. And I'll end really where I started, which is we're off to a very good start in 2024, with an 88% combined ratio for the quarter and a 20% ROE. And from the prepared remarks and the commentary that we found over the past hour, you see that we are still in a market with strong trading conditions, generating that 17% growth that you saw overall for the first quarter. And then you certainly heard about the opportunities we see in both Reinsurance and Insurance for the remaining part of the year. And lastly, we're very focused on delivering our 3-year plan. And I think you've heard from Mark and from us pretty clearly that we still see that ability to generate excess of 17% TSR on an ongoing basis. So with that, thank you very much, and we'll talk in the next quarter. Operator : And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Rohrmann, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Rohrmann : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Everest Group Limited second quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I'll preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in Everest's SEC filings. Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These items are reconciled in the earnings release and financial supplement available on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Everest had another strong quarter and an excellent first half of the year. We delivered solid second quarter underwriting and net investment income, resulting in both an annualized total shareholder return and operating return on equity of 20%. We grew in lines of business and geographies with superior profit trajectories while remaining focused on disciplined risk selection. We continue to build a well-diversified portfolio designed to produce leading financial returns. Our reinsurance business continued to generate strong results and expected risk-adjusted returns remain very attractive. Our preferred lead market position continues to be a differentiator for Everest. This was once again evident through the mid-year renewals as there was strong demand for our participation on treaties from a broad array of top-tier customers. We also made progress expanding our primary insurance franchise with investments in talent and capabilities to scale the platform globally. We opened new operations in Mexico, Colombia and Australia. Both of our underwriting businesses are capitalizing on opportunities where market conditions are most attractive and where we can achieve sustained profitable growth. At the same time, our investment portfolio is delivering strong and consistent earnings. We are executing on our strategy with significant momentum heading into the second half of the year. Most importantly, we are delivering on our primary objective of generating industry-leading financial returns as measured by total shareholder return. Our strategy provides significant operating flexibility with multiple paths to achieving our primary objective in 2024, 2025 and 2026 as outlined at our last Investor Day. With that backdrop, I will now turn to our second quarter financial highlights, beginning at the Group level. Everest second quarter performance resulted in an annualized total shareholder return of 20% and net operating income of $730 million, an increase of more than $100 million year-over-year. We grew gross written premiums by 13% in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums, while remaining disciplined in casualty lines, particularly in North America. We generated $358 million in underwriting profit in the quarter and $767 million year-to-date, an increase of $94 million as compared to the first half of 2023. The Group combined ratio of 90.3% included $135 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums from several mid-sized international and U.S. events. This is a good result, particularly given that the elevated level of global industry catastrophe losses is now estimated at approximately $60 billion year-to-date. In the quarter, we improved our attritional loss ratio by 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by mix contributions from both segments, sustained pricing momentum and disciplined underwriting. Terms and conditions also remained favorable. As I mentioned earlier, our investment portfolio continued to perform well, producing over $0.5 billion of net investment income in the quarter and nearly $1 billion year-to-date. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Second quarter reinsurance results were excellent. The business delivered underwriting profits of more than $300 million. The attritional loss ratio and attritional combined ratio improved to 57% and 84.4%, respectively, as we continue to proactively shape the portfolio. Consistent with our execution at the January and April renewals, Everest had excellent midyear renewals. We expanded our portfolio with top-tier cedents growing across property and specialty lines, including marine, aviation and engineering at excellent expected margins. As the June 1 renewal progressed and overall reinsurance capacity became scarce in the final days, Everest secured a number of shortfall covers at superior terms. On many Florida deals, we successfully negotiated non-concurrent terms, including higher minimum premiums and lower ceding commissions. Our property book grew more than 25% at the June 1 renewal. In addition, cat exposed premium continued with a double-digit growth trajectory at the July renewal with higher expected margins compared to last year. Importantly, across the mid-year renewals, we achieved preferential signings, drove differentiated terms and conditions on a number of property catastrophe deals, and we were signed in-full on virtually every transaction we chose to participate on. Overall, we grew the business by 17% on a constant dollar basis, excluding reinstatement premiums in the second quarter. Growth in our property pro rata book increased significantly, up 31% from last year as we took advantage of the strong underlying property market, particularly in commercial E&S. Property market conditions continue to be favorable. Rates have persisted at attractive levels and terms and conditions and attachment points have not wavered from the significant improvement made over the past two years. In casualty, we remain disciplined in lines that did not meet our underwriting criteria. While casualty pro rata premiums grew in the second-quarter, this was primarily driven by strong rate increases as opposed to exposure growth. We have shed over $300 million in casualty renewal premiums so far this year as a number of programs did not meet our underwriting standards. The quality of our book is excellent and the strength of our franchise continues to set the business apart. We expect risk-adjusted returns to remain very attractive. Our outlook for 2025 remains bullish. Now turning to insurance. We grew the insurance business by 6% in constant dollars, generating $1.5 billion in premiums in the second quarter. As we continue to optimize our mix of business, overall growth was driven by a 31% increase in property short tail and 26% in specialty lines. Our international business continued to gain traction as we were rapidly becoming a go-to market for our distribution partners. The overall growth in the quarter was partially offset by the continued caution around casualty as well as the previously-announced Medical Stop Loss business exit, which started in 2023 and will be completed by the end of this year. Consistent with prior quarters, we were prudent in less attractive lines such as directors and officers liability, workers compensation and other casualty lines exposed to social inflation. We gained additional momentum and achieved rate acceleration in excess of loss trend across a wide array of casualty lines in the quarter as increases in commercial auto liability, general liability and excess casualty lines averaged in the mid-to-high teens. Looking across the portfolio, we achieved an average rate increase of over 10%, excluding workers compensation and financial lines. The combined ratio benefited from a 70 basis point improvement in the attritional loss ratio. This was offset by higher cat losses as last year's quarter was benign and lower-than-expected earned premium resulting from the underwriting actions I have already described. At our Investor Day last November, we set a goal of hitting a 90% to 92% combined ratio for insurance. We are confident in achieving our objective, but the timing for getting to our target combined ratio run rate is now 2025, and we will not be satisfied till we achieve this goal. In order to achieve our target, we must, one, create a more balanced mix of business, including more short-tail premium. Two, continue to increase scale, particularly in our international businesses, And three, continue to prudently navigate the underwriting environment. We are making good progress on all of these. First on mix. As I said, we grew short tail lines in the quarter by over 30% and our specialty business by 26%. These are good results, but there's more work to be done, particularly in North America. There were also some jurisdiction-specific regulatory approval delays in new international markets that have now been granted. Those operations are ramping up in the second half of the year. Second, scale improved in the quarter as we did achieve strong growth with very attractive loss ratios in our international businesses, where we have continued to invest in people, products, technology and infrastructure. Earned premium will start to catch up. Some of this progress was offset by our underwriting discipline actions such as the ongoing runoff of our North America Medical Stop Loss business, which I mentioned earlier. This reduced earned premium in the quarter by approximately $70 million. Finally, regarding our work to navigate the complex risk environment, we are keenly focused on the effect of social inflation on casualty loss costs. We are booking our casualty business at prudent loss picks. And while we are achieving increased rate in excess of observed loss trend, we are reducing writings in certain lines, classes and jurisdictions. As a result, casualty premiums were slightly down in the quarter. We are focused on underwriting margin and we walk away from business that does not meet our standards. We are pulling all of these levers and making progress to reach our target combined ratio for insurance. This is our immediate focus for this segment. And in conclusion, I am proud of what we have accomplished thus far. We have a clear strategy. We are focused on executing our plan and we are delivering above our target total shareholder return. We are focused on making Everest even stronger. Our reinsurance segment continued to exceed expectations. We are strengthening our insurance platform as we position ourselves as a go-to global market and continue to solidify our value proposition. With the market environment setting the stage for continued opportunity, Everest is well positioned to continue building momentum. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter, rounding out an excellent first half of 2024. We delivered significant growth in operating income, net income and net investment income for the second quarter. This drove operating earnings per share of $16.85 and both an operating ROE and annualized total shareholder return of approximately 20%. Our reinsurance division delivered another strong quarter with successful execution at recent renewals with strong top and bottom-line results. The insurance division continued to gain traction in key markets internationally. We have strong momentum across our business heading into the second half of the year. Looking at the Group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.7 billion, representing 12.8% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 90.3% for the quarter, driven by an improvement in the attritional loss ratio, offset by higher cat losses when compared to the prior year's relatively benign second quarter. The cat losses in the quarter were primarily driven by mid-size international events, including several global flooding events and the Taiwan earthquake as well as the U.S. convective storms. The Group attritional loss ratio was 58.8%, a 70 basis-point improvement over the prior year's quarter with both segments contributing to the improvement, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. The Group's commission ratio modestly increased to 21.4%. The Group expense ratio was in line with the prior year at 6.3%, while at the same time, we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 16.5% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was consistent with the trends seen throughout the prior year with strong and broad-based growth in property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in casualty lines. Property lines grew approximately 30% in the quarter with Property Pro Rata and Property Cat XOL both contributing to the strong growth. We continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short tail lines, which now stands at 56% property and 44% casualty, a 4-point shift from the prior year. The net earned premium mix stands at approximately 51% property and 49% casualty. Consistent with prior quarters, growth will continue to favor short tail business as we trend throughout the year, which will become more pronounced on an earned basis. The attritional combined ratio improved 30 basis points to 84.4% during the quarter. The attritional loss ratio improved 60 basis points to 57% as we continue to achieve more favorable rate and terms while building higher expected margins, particularly in property and specialty lines. In addition to the business mix, I mentioned earlier, the combined ratio was 88.9% as the prior year benefited from a relatively benign level of cat losses. Both the commission ratio and underwriting expense ratio relatively in line with the prior year at 24.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Moving to insurance, gross written premiums grew approximately 6% in constant dollars to $1.5 billion. We continued to methodically scale our primary franchise globally, while proactively focusing our North American portfolio towards the most accretive lines of business, led by retail property and short tail specialty lines. We're maintaining a conservative underwriting approach in casualty lines, mono-line workers comp, Medical Stop Loss and public company D&O. Our North American casualty growth is being driven predominantly by meaningful rate increases, and we began reducing certain lines such as Medical Stop Loss, starting in 2023, and we expect the drag to be completed by year end. While a number of casualty lines saw continued price acceleration in the mid-to-high teens, gross written premiums were down slightly as we are focused upon risk selection, which meet our underwriting standards. Casualty rate increases remain above loss trend. We will continue to practice prudent cycle and portfolio management, drive rate and hold the line on terms and conditions. We are starting to see the benefits of these actions in the results as the mix shift contributed to a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year in the attritional loss ratio to 63.7%. At the same time, we remain prudent with our loss picks to reflect the elevated risk environment. The commission ratio was relatively consistent with the prior year, while the underwriting-related expense ratio increased to 16.9%. The increase was a function of higher expenses due to accelerated investments in our global platform and the lag in earned premium from both underwriting discipline actions in North America and some temporary regulatory delays in new geographies that Juan mentioned earlier. We expect the expense ratio will start trending downward in 2025 and approach a more normalized level of 15% over time as our international footprint scales. Aside from cat, the lag in expected earned premium was the primary driver of the year-over-year increase in the segment combined ratio to 94.4% in the quarter. As Juan mentioned, while it will take us a little more time to get within the target insurance combined ratio range introduced at our Investor Day, we have a clear and well-defined path to achieve our insurance combined ratio objective during 2025. We do expect to have a 93% to 94% insurance combined ratio quarterly run rate for the rest of 2024. Given the overall strength of our franchise, we have significant momentum heading into the back half of the year. We are well-positioned with multiple paths to achieving our ESR objective. Our reinsurance segment continues to perform strongly and market conditions remain attractive. And as I just stated, we're on our way to improving our insurance combined ratio. Moving on to investments, net investment income increased over $170 million year-over-year to $528 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management, higher new money yields versus maturing assets and strong performance from alternative assets. Alternative assets generated $124 million of net investment income, an improvement from the prior year as equity markets have continued to accelerate. Overall, our book yield improved from 3.9% to 4.8% year-over-year and our reinvestment rate remains well north of 5%, which is in excess of maturing security yields. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.4 years, given the attractive level of short rates. The investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment and is built to generate strong returns on a consistent basis. For the second quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 13%, modestly higher driven by the mix of jurisdictional profits in the quarter. Our capital strength gives us ample capacity for 2024 and positions us well for profitable organic growth and to opportunistically repurchase shares. We repurchased 174,000 shares in the quarter, amounting to $65 million or an average of $374.17 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 264,000 shares, amounting to $100 million. And we will continue to look opportunistically to repurchase shares in the back half of the year. Shareholder's equity ended the quarter at $14.2 billion or $15.1 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed-income securities. At the end-of-the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $936 million, an increase of $60 million as compared to the end-of-the first-quarter, resulting from interest rate increases. Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion during the quarter. Book value per share ended the quarter at $327.68, an improvement of 8.9% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $3.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities stood at $349.30 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of almost 8.8%. Net debt leverage at quarter-end stood at 15.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had an excellent first half of the year. We have substantial flexibility and the fundamentals of our globally diversified businesses remain strong. Our investment strategy is well positioned and our capital structure is very efficient, providing ample capacity to execute our strategic plan. All of this positions us well to achieve our primary objective of consistently generating industry-leading financial returns. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matt Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. My first question goes to the pushback of the reported combined ratio target in insurance to 2025. Is that mostly driven by the expense ratio? Or is the loss ratio also a bit more elevated than you expected it to be for the year? Jim Williamson : Yes, Yaron, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. There are really two factors that we are focused on driving to get ourselves to the 90% to 92% performance level. The first is related to mix, and you heard Juan address that in his prepared remarks. We are focused and need to continue to focus on balancing our portfolio and writing more short-tailed lines. We are making excellent progress. We grew our first-party business in insurance in the quarter by over 30%. We grew our specialty business by over 25%. And third party, which is mostly liability was essentially flat. So, we are moving the mix in the right direction. We need to continue to do that. I would also add that our international business, which is growing very strongly contributes mightily to that portfolio shift. And then the second factor is related to scale. So, it's growth in all the areas I just described and continuing to drive that as we go forward and we do see excellent opportunities to do that. And then allowing our international business to fully mature. I mean we've opened a number of international offices. In most cases, you need to front load investments in people and technology and process in each of those offices. They're now online. They're producing premium. And as the earned premium catches up, you'll see more scale relative to our expense base. So, I don't really think it's an issue of the expense base being too high. We just needed to plant some seeds that we are now going to be reaping the fruit from. So those are the factors that get us there. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And so maybe if I try to translate that into expense ratio and loss ratio, it sounds like the mix issue would also drive the loss ratio down over time. But at the same time also maybe lower the expense ratio and then the -- obviously the platform investments with slow revenues ramping up would be an expense ratio and back, right? Jim Williamson : Yes. Yaron, you're exactly right in that. The actions we're taking, they affect both of those dimensions simultaneously. So as you're growing into short tail, you get a mix benefit on your loss ratio, even while we're holding prudent and continue to hold prudent loss picks in all our lines, but especially in casualty. And then as the earned premium catches up, particularly in international, that scale benefit will drive down our expense ratio. So it's really -- you get the benefit in both directions. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then my second question, obviously, there's been a lot of focus this last quarter on liability reserves for 2020 through 2023's accident years as well. And just given the reserve actions that you took at the end of last year, could you maybe give us an update on how you're looking at those reserves today, specifically liability reserves for 2020 through 2023. Mark Kociancic : Yes, good morning, Yaron. It's Mark. Sure. So let me start with, look, we review our reserves quarterly and we do it on a comprehensive basis and that process hasn't changed. It's what we've done for numerous quarters in a row. We've set prudent loss picks and particularly for casualty, we plan to hold those loss picks. We've mentioned in previous quarters and we'll state it again today that we've got a broadly stable and elevated loss trend in U.S. casualty and that's what we expect in this kind of heightened risk environment that we've seen for quite a few quarters led by social inflation. We feel good about the loss trend that we're posting in our assumptions. It's a high single-digit for U.S. casualty. But the real key is what we've emphasized previously, which is we've been able to build significant rate, limit reductions, underwriting actions. We've been able to diversify the book significantly since 2020 and it's matured into something that's much larger and diversified than pre-2020. And we're also benefiting from the international expansion we're having on the primary side as it further diversifies long tail, short tail lines and the long tail international lines come with a different type of risk profile, which is, I would argue more favorable. So in terms of where we are today, our picks are holding. We have various puts and takes for the first half of the year, but nothing material overall. So we're standing tight. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So for my first question, you mentioned in the call, in your prepared remarks about shaping the portfolio and skewing it more towards shorter term or short-tailed businesses, including more cat property exposures. And so I guess what I'm curious is, how does that -- how does that change the cat assumptions that you guys are thinking about as it relates both to the reinsurance and insurance segments? Juan Andrade : Yes. Thanks, Greg. This is Juan. Good to hear from you. Look, I think there's a couple of things here that are important to keep in mind. One is how nimble and opportunistic we can be as a culture and as a company, which we're very focused on always trying to identify the highest economic return opportunities. And that's what you see us doing in both segments, both in reinsurance as well as primary insurance at this point in time. While there has been a moderation in pricing in property, property is still very adequate and we continue to be very much attracted to those lines of business and the expected returns in those lines of business continue to be quite strong for us. From a cat appetite standpoint, that really just is not having an impact as far as how we view our underwriting cat appetite and we continue to be in the box that we put out for you in our investor presentation really now going on for about three or four years. So we feel quite good about where we are. But the bigger picture in all of this is really skewing the portfolio to where we see the biggest margin opportunities around the world. But I'll ask Jim to maybe add a little bit of context as well. Jim Williamson : Yes, sure, Greg. It's Jim Williamson. So the one thing I would emphasize that Juan has already said because I do think it's very important is if you look at our risk metrics, we've talked about earnings and capital at risk, we are well within the stated Group appetite. And so that gives us the flexibility where we see great opportunities to deploy some more capacity. And you certainly saw us do that in the second quarter, driven mostly by reinsurance, but also by insurance. The other thing that I think is a really telling item is the fact that our insurance division, while we have had such strong growth in first party lines, we haven't really had outsized cat losses even though there's been a lot of activity, certainly in the U.S. and around the world. And that's because we've been careful to grow our business, particularly in non-peak zones. And we've also been very thoughtful about where we're participating in large programs, shared and layered programs about selecting our attachment points thoughtfully to get the best economics and it also keeps us away from a lot of the attritional cat activity we've seen. So nothing in our growth trajectory that we see right now would change our assumptions around the cat load, for example, feeling very good about things. Gregory Peters : Fair enough. I'm going to pivot to the top-line results in the insurance segment for my second question. If I look at the year-over-year comparison on a net written basis, not a lot of growth as you continue to adjust the portfolio, you mentioned the Medical Stop Loss is one point. When you think about how -- and you talked about the target combined ratio moving it to 2025, how should we think about consolidated top-line growth inside the insurance segment as you continue to reshape the portfolio trying to get your target combined ratio. Jim Williamson : Yes, Greg, it's Jim again. Good question. So a couple of points. One, where you started on net written premium, you'll see obviously, that's a different number than the growth rate you're seeing on gross written. Really two factors there. First is the geography of our gross written premium growth has changed as we've focused on reshaping the portfolio. And so we've been growing more top-line in lines of business with a lower net-to-gross retention. So you will see for the next couple of quarters just a slight drag on net written premium as a result of that. And then lastly, there was just a change related to our hedging strategy in some of our short tail lines in North-America that creates a little bit of a drag on net written premium as well. So we'll work through that on a year-over-year basis over the next couple of quarters and then it won't be a factor as we go forward. In terms of you know, growing from there and driving the scale that we'll need to get to the 90 to 92 combined ratio and all the other things we talked about, it's really continuing the things that we said. So in this quarter, again first party up over 30, specialty over 25, now that's offset by the fact that third-party lines, despite all the rate we're taking were essentially flat. But the growth in those shorter tail lines, the expansion of our international business is really picking up speed. It's becoming a larger part of our overall business across all those dimensions. And so I think it will overcome this cautious approach we have on casualty as we move forward, which is why although we were not at the level of performance that we want to see yet, we remain very confident that we'll get there because all the levers that we need to pull are right in front of us. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the insurance 90% to 92% target. So you guys said 93% to 94% this year and then going within that range next year. Is that something that we should think about? You'll be within the 90% to 92% in the first quarter of '25 or is it something that you'll build to throughout the year? Mark Kociancic : Good morning, Elyse. It's Mark. So yes, I expect this to be 93% to 94% for the remainder of the next two quarters, largely driven by the two features that we've discussed. So one, you've got an elevated expense ratio as we're ramping up and then this mix of business earned premium dynamic will likely persist for a few more quarters. I do see us getting into that 90% to 92% range in the back-half of 2025. So it will be a gradual transition over the coming quarters. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is also keeping on the insurance business. You guys said that rate was 10% ex-workers comp and financial lines. So what loss costs would compare to that 10? And then can you also provide the all-in rate that you're seeing across the insurance book, including workers' comp and financial lines? Juan Andrade : Yes. Elyse, this is Juan. So the loss trend that we're seeing is roughly high single-digits. So the 10% obviously compares well to that. And remember what we said about the long-tail lines about commercial auto liability, general liability in excess that are running into the mid-to-high teens up and that's been accelerating. So we feel pretty good about where we are as far as being rate ahead of loss trend and all of that. If you include sort of where we are, including workers' compensation, it's roughly pretty stable to what we've seen over the last three or four quarters, which is right around 6% or 7%, including workers compensation. Elyse Greenspan : And then what about if you also include financial lines? Juan Andrade : That's all included. So if we include everything together, it's about 6% to 7%. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, it's actually Dan on for Mike. Thanks. Good morning. First one, just a follow-up on the insurance combined ratio target. Your answer on the mix of business being one of the -- does that imply that your views on the loss ratios worsened versus last quarter since the business mix has been changing or is it a more prudent view on the casualty loss ratio, which would make sense given casualty inflation levels or is it that the mix maybe hasn't shifted as much as you expected? Thanks. Jim Williamson : Yes, Dan, it's Jim Williamson. So it really comes down to the speed at which that mix is adjusting because we have sustained very prudent loss picks. On the casualty lines, our view on that hasn't changed and we really haven't had anything that's affected the short-tail loss picks either. So it's all about mix. While we have had terrific results in the mix shift and the growth in the short tail and specialty lines that I described, we had hoped to be a little further along. A couple of things are going on under the covers, mainly it took us a little longer-than-expected to get some of our international offices approved for operation. Those are now all up and running and we'll see the benefits of that over the back half. And then I would just say generally, as we've started this mix shift, you see it in the written premium first and we're -- when I'm citing like a 30-plus percent first-party growth rate that's on a gross written premium basis. Now that the net written premium is catching up, that will begin to have that gearing effect on our ratios as we move forward both -- and that's again, both a loss ratio and then with the scale comes a better expense ratio. Juan Andrade : And the other thing. I would add, and this is Juan, it's really going back to Yaron's question and what I said in my prepared remarks that the international business is growing quite well and it's grown with very attractive loss ratios, right? This is something that we've talked about in prior calls. Those loss ratios are well in the 50s. And so as that business continues to be a bigger portion of the overall insurance business you should get a positive mix benefit happening there. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And then maybe just following up on the international growth and Everest strategy growing internationally. Just wondering about what kind of the social inflation level you're seeing internationally and how that's impacting your loss assumptions and growth appetite maybe in certain geographies? Jim Williamson : Yes. It's a great question. Frankly, it's one of the reasons why we strategically decided to do this now a few years ago. Look, social inflation is largely a U.S. phenomenon because of the tort system and the way our legal system works in the United States. Outside of the U.S., there's very few jurisdictions that have anywhere near the same level of inflation, legal system and abuse that you have in the United States of America. So from that perspective, growing overseas is one of the reasons why it produces a lower loss ratio overall. In addition to that is most of these markets tend to be more first-party oriented towards property, marine, those kinds of lines, which carry better loss ratios to begin with. So I would highlight that listen, outside of the U.S., you know, there's very few jurisdictions that have similar issues and frankly, nowhere even close to what you see in the United States from a legal system abuse perspective. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Thank you. Jim Williamson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Two of them here for you. First one, more of a numbers question on the 93 to 94 in insurance for the remainder of the year. I'm assuming and maybe I'm wrong here that you would have a higher cat load in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. So is that kind of an average you're thinking over the remainder of the year or am I wrong there? Mark Kociancic : Brian, it's Mark. You'd be right, but cat is a much smaller proportion of the primary segment than of the reinsurance segment. And we've done a pretty nice job, I think, of managing cat risk in general. So that is included in our run rate 93 to 94 figure. Brian Meredith : Got you. That makes sense. Thank you. And then second question one, I'm just curious, Jim, the expansion internationally, obviously, a lot of -- you've got a little bit of expense coming through. But I guess, is there any contemplation of adverse selection as you kind of move into these newer markets that a lot of them are kind of entrenched with legacy carriers have been there for a long, long, long time. Maybe tell me about how you're going to kind of approaching this and kind of getting into these new markets? Jim Williamson : Yes. No, that's a great question, Brian. Look, really what we're after is upper middle market and large account business where there's significant competitive gaps among the other players in that space. So remember, we're not playing in small commercial or consumer lines in any of these markets where you would have the more local or regional companies that are entrenched in this. We are dealing with risks that have sophisticated risk managers, sophisticated risk needs, et cetera. And frankly, a lot of the competition is not focused on the space right now. So for us, it's really about a competitive advantage that is based on service, it's based on risk expertise, things like loss control, loss engineering, claims, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a very different risk mindset than you would run into in a sort of typical small commercial middle market type environment. It's really a segment where the risk manager really values the underwriting acumen and the expertise of our team essentially. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Brian. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Yes. Juan Andrade : Sorry, I just wanted to add just two quick things to Jim Williamson, two quick things that I think are also very important there. The first is we have been able to attract really the best people in each of the markets that we've chosen to launch our operations in, which I think gives us a line of sight into risk quality locally that you can't get if you try to run these businesses with expats. And then I would also say that we monitor the results of that business very closely. And as we said, it skews much shorter tail. So we're getting a quick read, an early read on performance of that business and all results so far indicate that we have excellent performance in our risk selection. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Dean Criscitiello with KBW. Dean Criscitiello : Hi. I wanted to dig a bit into the attritional loss ratio within insurance. Of that 70 basis points of year-over-year improvement, is there any way to sort of quantify like the positive mix shift benefits there? And also was wondering if that loss pick assumes higher casualty loss trends. Mark Kociancic : So good morning, Dean. It's Mark. So we've had a couple of things. First of all, we set prudent loss picks across the Board. So whether it's property or casualty taking into account market conditions at the beginning of the year from last year's planning cycle and then thoroughly reviewed every quarter, there is a shift in mix generally. So broadly speaking, you heard us talk about a significant growth in property. I think the figures were roughly 31%, specialty line growth north of 20% and then more modest movement on the U.S. casualty side in particular. So what you're seeing in general is, I think the figures are roughly 62% long-tail line composition of our premium mix in Q4 of last year, diminishing to something closer to 55%, 56% at this point. So, you've got a swing in the mix from longer tail to shorter tail. And in conjunction with that, you've got an increase in premium composition coming from the international markets relative to what we're doing in North America. So, that's going to swing some of those, that's going to swing the overall attritional loss ratio mechanically. I think most of the swing year-over-year will be a function of mix and a lesser function of the loss pick selection. Dean Criscitiello : Thank you with that. I wanted to next shift to the casualty reinsurance. I was just curious about how the market conditions, competition, rate dynamics are different between the pro rata book and the excess of loss book. Jim Williamson : Yes, sure. Dean, it's Jim Williamson. I mean, those are in many ways very, very different businesses, even though they're both casualty. What we've seen in casualty pro rata is just an abundance of capacity in the market. It's been more competitive than we think frankly it makes sense, and one of the key dynamics that we think needs to play out is a reduction in ceding commissions on that line. There has been some progress, but it's been in the neighborhood of about a point on average as we've moved through our renewals. We think more is needed and that's one of the reasons in addition just to some caution around the heightened risk environment that we've shed over $300 million in casualty pro rata renewals this year. And so that it's a pretty competitive market and we pick our spots carefully. We think the book performs well, but we are cautious. Casualty XOL is a very different market. It's a quite a small portion of our portfolio. While we did see a lot of -- we've seen growth at times. In the quarter, we were actually down slightly. The issue that we have there is not so much related to commission levels. It's really just making sure that our cedents are carefully managing social inflation. That is a line where we've seen some of that activity. And that's why we keep it as a relatively small share of our business. Dean Criscitiello : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from [Peter Kennison] with Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. So I'm curious on the Prop Cat Re growth number. I know last quarter that 4% growth had some impact by the recognition timing of Florida from 2Q '23. And I think ex that it was really up 24% on a clean basis. I'm wondering, is that '25 reported number a clean number or is there any sort of timing impact in this quarter as well that you could help me remove, if possible? Mark Kociancic : So Peter, it's Mark here. So in terms of the reinsurance Property Cat XOL growth, we've got 30% growth year-over-year on a quarterly basis, so Q2 this year versus Q2 last year. We talked about the dynamics last quarter about the methodology of booking it on a quarterly basis versus the almost what I would call a cash basis, which was really the deposit premiums on Q1 and Q3. And so that's been working its way through the system. The way I would look at it is if you take a look at the four quarters trailing, you're right in the 20% range or slightly above. So, this will normalize out by the end-of-the year, this accounting phenomenon. So that's really 30% year-over-year on the quarter and a north of 20% run rate on a rolling 12-month basis? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. And just following up on that growth. You know, a pretty solid result amidst a time where we've maybe seen some others pull back a little bit. And so I guess I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk more about what Everest is seeing there that might be different or what Everest is doing differently that's allowing you guys to really lean in right now. Jim Williamson : Sure, Peter. This is Jim Williamson. We have enjoyed a really terrific set of circumstances and opportunities in Property Cat. And I would really point to a couple of things. First, we've really achieved a lead market position in this generational hard market and it began really at the end of 2022 where you had a dislocated property cat market post Hurricane Ian. There was a lot of uncertainty in the market and frankly, a lot of bad behavior on the part of a number of reinsurers in terms of how they were treating their customers. I think Everest got high marks for being constructive, for being willing to create price discovery and for putting capacity to work. And the benefit of that and the reputational impact of that, I think will be very long-lived. And because we've been so consistent since that point in terms of how we manage our customers, getting out early ahead of renewals, you know, feeding capacity where it makes sense into their programs, taking up shortfalls, et cetera, we now are really in that lead market position. And what that brings to us is the opportunity to be the first carrier they call when they're looking to fill out new capacity and there's been a lot of new capacity buying. So that's been a boon to us. In many instances, we're able to achieve non-concurrent terms because our customers want us on their programs and that can benefit us in terms of pricing, in terms of terms and conditions. On the pro rata side, it can benefit us in ceding commissions. So you reap all kinds of benefits and that's been a very attractive part of this. And then I would just say it's also yielded benefits outside of property cat. So we get a first look at new programs or attractive non-cat lines of business that we want to write. So those are the things that I think are driving differentiated results for us. Now what we see in the market, whether it was the 6/1 renewal or 7/1 or frankly our expectations for January 1, 2025 is that the expected economics of these deals remain excellent. So as we model these transactions, expected return on our capital is just exceptional and we're continuing to lean into that. Our terms and conditions, which improved strongly at January 1, '23 have stayed strong. There's been no giveback that we've seen, no material give back in terms and conditions, which is significant. And then lastly, attachment points are not moving. And we like that because it takes us out of this attritional cat losses, if you will. So really it's our execution plus a market opportunity that remains excellent that allows us to drive the results you're seeing. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Charlie Lederer with Citigroup. Charlie Lederer : Hi, thank you. I think you mentioned shedding some casualty programs business in your remarks. Juan, I guess, was that a new termination or was it related to some of the issues from last year? And can you help us better understand what you're shedding? Juan Andrade : Yes, sure. So I mentioned two things. So I mentioned that in the reinsurance segment, we have shed about $300 million of casualty pro-rata renewals so far in the first six months of the year. And I think Jim did a nice job expanding on that a few minutes ago. Those were basically a pro-rata deals that we didn't like the economics. We're being cautious in casualty, as I stated, and so we moved on, but you still saw the growth of the book in general. And even in the casualty line, you saw growth. But as I said in my remarks, it was all rate-driven as opposed to exposure driven. So, I think that's the first part of that. And then on the insurance side of things, it's a similar story, right, where we are being cautious. And I said that we had rate in excess-of-loss trend for the long-tail lines in excess of mid-to-high teens which is excellent. But you also saw the top-line for the casualty lines be slightly down. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense of the discipline where we're looking at certain classes, jurisdictions, lines of business very carefully. And frankly, we're choosing to grow in areas where there's better margins, more certain margins, which are certainly the specialty lines and the short-tailed property lines right now. Charlie Lederer : Got it. Thanks. And I don't think you touched on this, but sorry if you did. So beyond the three geographies you detailed for new entrants or new entries internationally, are there other major markets that you're looking to enter and scale near-term in insurance? Juan Andrade : We have one more that we have on tap before the end-of-the year and that's basically Italy in Europe. And I think at that point, we'll pause for a period of time and really starting to dig deeper into each of the geographies that we've already opened. Charlie Lederer : Thank you. Juan Andrade : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Juan Andrade for any closing comments. Juan Andrade : Great. Thank you. Thank you all for the questions and the excellent discussion today. I look forward to meeting again and discussing our third quarter results. Thank you for your support of Everest. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Juan. Juan Andrade : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered another successful quarter with strong operating income, driven by healthy underwriting results and investment income. This resulted in an annualized total shareholder return of 19.4% and an annualized operating return on equity of 18.7% year-to-date. These results reflect our underwriting discipline and prudent risk management, which position the company to generate leading returns despite what has already been another year in, which industry catastrophe losses were higher than normal. Our thoughts are with all the people affected by these catastrophes across the globe from Hurricane Beryl's impact in the Caribbean, the Storm Boris in Europe and most recently in the US. First, hit hard by Hurricane Helene in late September and then by Hurricane Milton in early October. It has been an active third quarter and the impact of these natural catastrophes further strengthen our conviction that we have the right strategy. Our reinsurance franchise is generating excellent results and it's differentiating itself as a lead market. We are well-positioned to benefit from attractive market conditions in a number of lines of business as we approach the January 1 renewals and beyond. In our insurance segment, we made progress on a number of fronts including improving the portfolio mix by growing in lines of business with higher expected profit trajectories and pulling back in less attractive lines, and continuing to gain traction internationally. Our primary focus in insurance remains on building an increasingly profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. Additionally our investment portfolio continued to outperform, generating nearly $500 million of net investment income in the third quarter. With that backdrop, I will now turn to our third quarter financial highlights beginning at the group level. We grew the company with a focus on property and specialty lines where we see the highest expected risk-adjusted returns. Growth in these lines is well into the double digits for both segments. Currently we are pulling back in certain casualty lines and subclasses in North America that are less attractive and are more prone to social inflation pressures. These disciplined cycle and portfolio management actions contributed to an improvement of 50 basis points in our attritional loss ratio. The combined ratio included approximately eight points of catastrophe losses from three hurricanes, Canadian storms and wildfires, and a major flood event in Europe. Over the past few years, we have proactively exited or reduced our exposure to the largest seasons in Florida. We have lowered our share with Florida specialists and we have optimized our diversification throughout the state and we have reduced our overall exposure to US accounts that are heavily exposed to secondary perils, including flooding. These actions have allowed us to grow our property catastrophe portfolio with higher levels of expected profitability and drive strong results even when events happen. The success of these portfolio management efforts is illustrated by our Helene loss of $78 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Based on our preliminary assessment to date, we estimate that losses from Hurricane Milton, which made landfall as a Category three in early October, will impact Everest's fourth quarter results in the range of $300 million to $400 million on a pre-tax basis, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums. Our estimated range is based on information that is preliminarily available, which projects a total insurance industry loss of $25 billion to $35 billion. This again, reinforces the importance of our actions to manage natural catastrophe volatility and build a resilient portfolio. Turning now to our reinsurance business. Our third quarter results were once again, excellent. We continue to execute on our portfolio and cycle management initiatives to maximize risk-adjusted returns. This was evident in growth in the quarter, driven by property catastrophe excess of loss and property pro rata, which remained attractive and where we grew in the mid to high teens. Conversely, as a result of our prudence in casualty lines, casualty pro rata and casualty excess of loss premium, growth rates decreased to levels in the mid-single-digit range. This is a result of the actions, we have discussed in prior calls all year. So far year-to-date, we have actively shed over $400 million of casualty renewal premiums as we see these lines as less attractive and in need of further correction in terms of underlying pricing and ceding commissions. We continue to see strong opportunities to expand the portfolio in those lines with the best expected returns, primarily property and specialty. Both the attritional loss and attritional combined ratios improved, resulting in $245 million of underwriting profit. The quarter included catastrophe losses of $239 million, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums again, reflecting the resilience we have built into this business. Our strategy to focus on top-tier seedings, further enables us to produce consistent returns throughout the cycle. In the aftermath of Milton and other international events, we expect property catastrophe pricing in North America and Europe to firm heading into the January one renewals. Demand for our capacity has also increased. Following recent catastrophe events and high-quality cedents continue to expand their relationship with us. In addition, Everest underwriting strategies have allowed us to build what we believe to be meaningful embedded margin in our reinsurance reserves. Our reinsurance segment is well positioned to continue generating strong margins. Now turning to insurance. Our increasingly diversified insurance platform, positions us to be agile as evidenced by our discipline this quarter. For example, we have favorable market conditions in well-priced short tail and specialty lines, and strong capabilities in our expanding international business. So we leaned into this and we grew by double digits. Conversely, we are increasingly cautious in certain casualty lines in the US, as the environment remains challenging. This is the long-term value of the increasingly diversified platform that we have created. We can play offense and defense to pursue the most economically attractive opportunities. With regards to North America, we achieved an average rate increase of 11% across the portfolio excluding workers' compensation and financial lines. Rate in the aggregate, remains above expected loss trend. In casualty lines, such as general liability, commercial auto liability and excess liability, rate accelerated well into the high teens. These rate increases are necessary to respond to the elevated loss activity that we're experiencing as an industry and as a company. Everest continues to closely monitor the persistent problem of social inflation and legal system of use in the United States. In US casualty lines, we are focused on continuing to take action in classes exposed to this trend. For example, real estate, habitational and leisure accounts and we are taking decisive underwriting actions. Our teams are selective on new business, achieving strong rate increases and non-renewing underperforming accounts. As a disciplined underwriting company, our goal is to ensure we are writing business only where pricing is adequate to earn our target risk-adjusted return. We expect the combination of these actions to result in a higher margin and more consistently profitable book. In addition to our standard quarterly reserve review process, we will conclude our annual long-tail deep dive reserve studies within the insurance segment in the back half of the fourth quarter and we will continue to take a conservative approach to the findings. In conclusion, let me step back and summarize the status of our businesses. Our reinsurance business is firing on all cylinders. We are the lead treaty market for most of our global clients and we have a nimble and profitable facultative business with a global footprint. In insurance, our short-tail and specialty underwriting in the US is strong and we are increasingly local and relevant to our key brokers in markets across the country. We have upgraded important talent and we are investing in people and automation to keep driving that business. Similarly, our international insurance expansion is exceeding expectations. We have hired the best leaders in the business to drive that initiative. They've built an excellent book of business and all of our performance indicators are pointing in the right direction. That leaves one area of the portfolio where we are taking ongoing and aggressive actions, segments of our insurance casualty book in the US that are exposed to the real issues of legal system abuse. So looking ahead, we will remain disciplined and opportunistic in our underwriting, while building franchise value through best-in-class execution for our clients. Our diversified businesses and our high-performing investment portfolio coupled with our very strong balance sheet and our significant capital strength give us the flexibility and the optionality to position Everest for the long-term, as we focus on delivering industry-leading returns through the cycle. With that I'll turn it over to Mark to review the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Juan and good morning, everyone. Everest had another strong quarter delivering solid growth in operating income and net investment income. This drove operating earnings per share of $14.62 and an annualized total shareholder return of over 19%. Our Reinsurance division continues to differentiate itself in the market delivering another strong underwriting quarter. The Insurance division continued to gain traction in key markets internationally, while at the same time growing materially in short-tail lines and remaining conservative in certain casualty lines as we continue to recalibrate the North American portfolio and focus on improving underwriting profitability. Looking at the group results. Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.4 billion, representing approximately 1% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 93.1% for the quarter, driven by an improvement in the attritional loss ratio, offset by higher CAT losses when compared to the prior year figures relatively benign third quarter. CAT losses of $279 million in the quarter, net of recoveries and reinstatement premiums were driven by several events globally including Hurricanes Helene, Beryl and Debby, as well as weather events in Europe and Canada. The group attritional loss ratio was 58.5%, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter and the group's commission ratio decreased to 21.1%. The group expense ratio improved from the prior year to 6%, while at the same time we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Gross written premiums grew 1.7% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by property and specialty lines, while we continue to remain disciplined in casualty lines. Property Pro Rata and Property Cat XOL grew 19% and 15% in the quarter respectively. And when normalizing growth in Property CAT XOL on a 12-month basis growth increases to 22%. Casualty Pro Rata and Casualty XOL decreased in the quarter by 7.2% and 5.9% respectively. As Juan mentioned, we expect pricing to firm heading into the January one renewals and are well positioned to capitalize on favorable market conditions, particularly in property and specialty lines. We continue to see the written premium mix shift towards property and short-tail lines which stands at 56% property and 44% casualty a six point shift from the prior year. The net earned premium mix stands at approximately 55% property and 45% casualty. Consistent with prior quarters, growth will continue to favor short-tail line businesses which will become more pronounced on an earned basis. The attritional loss ratio improved 60 basis points to 56.9% during the quarter. The attritional combined ratio improved 140 basis points to 83.5%, as we continue to improve the scale and durability of the portfolio in addition to the business mix benefits. The commission ratio improved 90 basis points to 23.9% and underwriting expense ratio was in line with the prior year at 2.5%. Combined ratio was 91.8% and includes 9.1 points of CAT losses, driven by the storm activity previously mentioned, while the prior year third quarter included 6.4 points of catastrophe losses. Moving to insurance. Gross written premiums decreased approximately 2% in constant dollars to $1.2 billion. As stated in prior calls, we are proactively shaping the portfolio mix towards the most accretive lines of business and we made further progress in the quarter. We also continued to scale our primary franchise globally. While the North America business was down overall, we continue to generate strong growth in retail property and specialty lines each increasing in the double-digits. This growth was offset by reductions in certain casualty lines in North America, which were down in aggregate by almost 20%, driven by our intentional portfolio actions as Juan described earlier. Our international business continues to grow well into the double digits. And we also continue to be conservative in monoline workers' comp, medical stop-loss and public company D&O. As we stated previously, we expect the drag associated with the runoff of our A&H medical stop-loss business to be completed by the end of the year. We will continue to focus on prudent risk selection, rate adequacy and holding the line on terms and conditions. Following the third quarter, we announced an agreement for Ryan Specialty to acquire our EverSports and Entertainment Insurance business. The deal is a win for all parties and is well aligned with the strategic objectives of both organizations and this transaction will be accounted for in the fourth quarter. The attritional loss ratio was 63.3% in the quarter and this is consistent with the prior year and reflects our actions to shape the portfolio, while remaining disciplined particularly in casualty lines. The commission ratio increased by 40 basis points to 12.2% in the quarter. The underwriting related expense ratio increased by 80 basis points, as we continue to make investments in our global platform, drive underwriting discipline in North America and scale our international operations. The segment combined ratio increased to 97.1% in the quarter which includes 4.2 percentage points of catastrophe losses. The prior year third quarter benefited from a relatively benign level of CAT losses. And moving on to investments. Net investment income was $496 million in the quarter, an increase of $90 million versus the prior year third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher assets under management and higher new money yields versus maturing assets. Alternative assets generated $72 million of net investment income, a slight decrease from the prior year. Overall, our book yield improved from 4.2% to 4.8% year-over-year. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years. Given the attractive level of short rates, the investment portfolio remains well-positioned for the current environment and the fixed income portfolio benefits from an average credit rating AA-. For the third quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was 10.7% modestly lower than the second quarter and driven by the mix of jurisdictional profits in the quarter. Our capital strength continues to provide us the ability to pursue profitable growth and opportunistically, repurchase shares and we repurchased 272,000 shares in the quarter amounting to $100 million or an average of $367.3 per share. Year-to-date we've repurchased 536,000 shares amounting to $200 million. We will look to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $15.3 billion or $15.6 billion excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equaled approximately $220 million, a decrease of $716 million as compared to the end of the second quarter resulting from interest rate decreases. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion during the quarter and book value per share ended the quarter at $356.77, an improvement of 19.1% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $5.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $361.87 versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 12.7%. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 14.3%, modestly lower on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In conclusion, Everest had another strong quarter generating a total shareholder return in excess of our target. Our diversified franchises, well-positioned investment portfolio, and our meaningful excess capital positions us well going forward. And with that I'll turn the call over back to Matt. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks Mark. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask that you please limit your questions to one question plus one follow-up then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning everybody. So, first, I realize that liability lines are not monolithic. But I think that's the cut in premiums in the face of high teen insurance rates and embedded margins in reinsurance may cause some confusion. So, I guess what would you say to investors who may be concerned that the cuts and casualty premiums are a sign of higher accident year loss picks to come and/or for the need for reserve strengthening? Juan Andrade : Hi Yaron, it's Juan Andrade. Thanks for the question. Let me start and then I'll ask some of my colleagues to jump in as well. One of the things to keep in mind about our strategy is that diversification is one of the cornerstones. We're very nimble and we're very opportunistic. You see that in that 6% operating expense ratio for the quarter and that we consistently deliver. So, we're able to move when we see the opportunities. So, for us, cycle management and portfolio management it's what we do and it's what we do to ensure that we get the best possible returns. You've seen us do this before. We've done it in workers' compensation. We've done it in public D&O. We've done it with our medical stop-loss book and we certainly did it in our property book back in 2022 before rates firmed up prior to Hurricane Ian. So, we see the best opportunities today as I just said in my remarks in property and specialty lines. And while there's still some casualty lines out there that we like, there's also others that we don't given the environment. The environment remains elevated. We've stated our intentions previously to achieve a more optional balance in our portfolio, particularly in North America insurance. We've also talked about before, the fact that in our reinsurance portfolio, we're starting to skew the mix more towards property catastrophe in property in general because of the rate and the terms and conditions that we like. And so when you think about pricing being enough, particularly in the casualty lines in the primary business, loss trend is also elevated, right? And it has been elevated for quite some time. And we do expect social inflation to remain an issue. That's why we're being cautious in these lines of business. And this is one of the reasons why we've stated in the past that we're changing the mix of our portfolio to be more focused on those lines of business that we find more accretive. So, really none of this is new news. I mean it's information that we've talked about publicly in the past. And it's really about constantly examining the portfolio to create the highest quality book. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And then maybe shifting a little bit here. Do you still expect to achieve the updated 93% to 94% reported combined ratio guide for insurance that you offered in the last quarter and in the second half of this year? Mark Kociancic : Well, Yaron, it's Mark. Good morning. So I think the 93% to 94%, it really depends on where we are with the CAT. I think the fundamentals underneath that are still there probably more importantly where we were guiding towards was the 92% in the back half of 2025. And I think we still feel confident about getting to that target. Ultimately, you're going to see several pieces move us towards that direction. So, starting with increasing the scaling of the premium in the insurance franchise; the mix of business, I think will provide us with a favorable combined split; and then obviously, focus on expense leverage. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Mark Kociancic : Thanks Yaron. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Gregory Peters : Hey. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to, have you provide further detail on your answer there Mark. Increasing scale you commented on the higher expenses inside the insurance segment. Can you frame for us how we should think about the expense ratio, both commission and other underwriting expenses in the insurance segment, when we model out in 2025 and 2026? Mark Kociancic : Yes. So Greg, I think on the commission ratio, you're going to see something that is broadly stable with what you're seeing in the third quarter, maybe slightly elevated as we shed -- as we complete our shedding of A&H business in 2024. But the mix of business, I think will keep it relatively stable towards that 12%-ish type level. The general expense, it's really two pieces. There's -- we continue to invest in our franchises both North America and internationally. And so those dollars get spent upfront in terms of people, systems and so on when we're setting up our locations for further development. And the earned premium that we expect thereafter is really what's going to drive that ratio down. So we're still in somewhat of a growth or investment phase in certain areas of insurance. So I can see the expense ratio being somewhat elevated now but fundamentally moving down as we get that premium scaling. And we've seen the benefits of some of the additions we made a couple of years ago, especially internationally in terms of hitting those teams to develop their premiums in their markets. And so we know that can be done. We feel good about it. It's really more of a timing issue than anything else. Gregory Peters : Okay. That makes sense. I guess I'll pivot to pricing and reinsurance. It feels like following Monte Carlo, following relatively benign year-to-date CAT experience that, at least through September price talk in property CAT was trending down, maybe 10% give or take, maybe a little bit more. Maybe the recent Hurricane Milton may stabilize a little bit but we're approaching year-end. And I know the reinsurance market always talks up price. And I know that the cedents always talk down price. As we go through the next two months, I know you said in your comments Juan that you expect pricing to hold maybe stable, but it feels like the pricing trend is down. So maybe you could give us some updated perspectives on pricing and reinsurance as we go into the January 1st renewals? Juan Andrade : For sure, Greg. Thanks for the question. I hope everything was fine with your homes down in Florida given the impact of the hurricanes. Look what I said in my remarks is that we expect firming to take place at the 1/1 renewals. And we see that. And I think you're right that when we were all in Monte Carlo not too long ago, the talk was probably that pricing could come down somewhere around minus 5% minus 10% for US property CAT et cetera. But I think there's a few things that have changed since Monte Carlo similar to what happened in 2022 post-Ian. We had two major storms hit the United States in Milton and Helene within essentially a week of each other. And I think that certainly sets the perspective on what's happening out there. I mean, we're seeing rapid intensification. We're seeing very powerful storms, et cetera. So that's the US component. The other part of it is Europe. So the thought process in Europe was also likely that things were going to be probably down minus 5%, et cetera. But you have the floods in place this year last year. Now we have Storm Boris in the third quarter, et cetera. So our thinking is that pricing is likely to go up plus 5%, plus 10% both in the US as well as in Europe. And ultimately we'll see at the end of the day when the dust to settle. But I know our teams are actively quoting right now and we're actively engaged in that renewal process. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Juan Andrade : Sure. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Josh Shanker : I definitely want to follow-up on that comment. So is this a negotiation going on right now? Is there a tough argument? If you talk to brokers, I think everyone says pricing should be down 5%. I think it used to be down 5%, maybe down 5% now. You're saying -- this is confident you're saying plus 5% plus 10% here. Is this a January -- December 31st negotiation that's going to bear out? Or are there firm orders that are telling you positive pricing is in the offering? Jim Williamson : Sure. Josh this is Jim Williamson. I mean, we're not at firm order terms yet. It's very early in the process. I do expect this to be fairly down to the wire in terms of the negotiation. But if you step back for a minute and think about some of the fundamentals, some of the things Juan touched on first of all, it's been a very active CAT quarter. Now it has been a little less active if you're a reinsurer than if you're a primary, but the fact is the losses are in the system. It's over $100 billion a year. Again we've had several major hurricanes and the most recent one, while I think not as bad as people had feared I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to recall that if it shifted to the north and hit Tampa, it would have been a much larger, maybe 2x or more type of event. So that's in everyone's mind. The other factors that I think are critical and it is against the backdrop of elevated loss and climate change and capital management. As our clients are looking to buy more capacity, demand is rising quite substantially. We've already had a number of conversations with core clients who are looking to buy more. So that is certainly a factor. And then lastly I would say our clients in particular are looking to buy more from Everest. I mean the quality of our capacity is second to none. And I think that just -- that peaks that demand for our paper. And I mean it's something north of one-third of our North America CAT deals have nonconcurrent terms, which I think will be very favorable for us as well. So I think all of that ladders up to a situation when we think rates will be firming and we think expected returns will be very strong. Josh Shanker : And just quickly you mentioned this potential loss that Milton put on. That's really about 6/1 more than its about 1/1 or do you think that has a 1/1 impact? Jim Williamson : No. I think it has -- absolutely has a 1/1 impact. Now clearly it's going to have more of a 1/1 impact on diversified US CAT programs than it would on a program in Europe. Europe's got its own problems obviously. So there is going to be some differentiation based on where in the world the program is. But I think for all US programs, they all have a variety of Southeast exposures. And I think the fact that there is this intensified hurricane activity and the near miss, I absolutely think it will weigh on pricing. Josh Shanker : Right. Thank you. And then on Mark's comments you talked about the changes in the mix in the reinsurance business and how that's going to affect the loss ratios. Just to clarify both should we expect that as the larger portion of short-tail business works that weigh in we should see the loss ratio decline year-over-year with a modestly higher CAT load to it? Mark Kociancic : Josh, it's Mark. I just want to clarify you're talking about insurance or reinsurance? I missed that part. Josh Shanker : Reinsurance. The pullback from longer-term lines and the short tail lines. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Look generally speaking yes. But the only caution I would provide is we obviously review the loss picks for relevance particularly on casualty now that we're in a what I would call a higher risk environment given the elevated loss trends. But generally speaking I would say yes. Josh Shanker : Okay, very good. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Josh/ Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays. Alex Scott : Hey, good morning. I was hoping we could come back to the reserve study in that you're going through in 4Q. I mean just from the pullback and it becoming seemingly much more significant this quarter in some of the comments it appears that your view of loss trend maybe changed more substantially since the last time you looked at this. And I just want to understand that dynamic and how impactful could this be for capital? I'm just trying to understand in the context of the share buybacks that were a bit higher and capital that maybe gets deployed towards property next year? Mark Kociancic : Good morning, Alex. It's Mark. I think the short answer is I really don't see scenario that impacts share buyback or excess capital strength that we currently have. So I mean that's the short answer on that part. I think the other pieces are we continue to build a well-diversified business. And so we're seeing strong margins particular in property and shorter tail lines of business. It's really North American casualty that is the elevated risk factor for the industry and that would include us and that's what we'll keep our eye on as we complete our studies. Taylor Scott : Got it. That's helpful. And then we've heard commentary from some other primaries that have suggested competition in property at least at the primary level has been very intense actually in the third quarter. I mean -- can you talk about what you're seeing there and maybe the change in behavior that you're seeing post some of these storms? Jim Williamson : Sure, Alex. This is Jim Williamson. Yes, a couple of comments. One I mean obviously that's the headline. I would say, if you look at the US, for example, and you peel that back most commercial property in the retail channel is actually still taking rate increases. And I think that is often overlooked. But we still see that in our middle market portfolio for example we're still in a positive rate environment. What is more competitive I would say is the wholesale market where you had just significant rate taking over the last few years I'd say risks are priced very adequately. And so you're going to see increased competition as people want to -- would they want to write those deals. And similarly in large shared and layered programs of the best quality risk the highly engineered global accounts again significant rate increases over the last few years very attractive opportunities. You're going to see some heightened competition there which is going to take headline rate levels down I think still very attractive. And then obviously we're seeing a little bit more competitiveness out of the London market. And again I know I'm repeating myself but we still think it's very, very attractive. So I think it's very much mix. Now, I do think recent events will help to ameliorate some of those trends. I don't necessarily expect some of those more competitive areas to suddenly flip to taking rate increases. But I do think, it will give folks pause and maintain adequate pricing levels for longer than you otherwise would have had. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Jim Williamson : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks and good morning, all. I guess, going back to the reserve issue it sounds, if I'm interpreting your comments correctly like there's much more confidence in the reinsurance segment reserve than in insurance. I was hoping, you could walk us through the differences there that leads to that differentiation? Mark Kociancic : Yeah. Meyer, it's Mark again. So maybe just to expand the commentary set the stage with where we are industry at large here. So I think we're clearly seeing North American casualty lines with elevated loss activity that's been persistent for several quarters for quite some time. And so that gives generally higher risk environment for US casualty. So you don't know what the outcomes are going to be and you don't know the ultimate length of time. So it creates higher risk. When you look at our reinsurance portfolio, you've got a very well-diversified portfolio short-tail financial lines casualty international business and so forth, a very mature organization multiple lines geographies. And we track cedent data. We've done I think a very good job of constructing the reinsurance portfolio over the last few years in particular, with an eye on casualty as well as other lines. And so preemptively, we've been more cautious, I would say on casualty in terms of ceding selection terms, ceding commissions and pricing discipline. So when you think about all that and what I would argue is a pretty clear embedded margin in a lot of the shorter tail and financial lines that, we have we feel good about that strength as we deal with the higher risk environment that US casualty is creating. Now, if we move to insurance we don't have that same level of diversification yet. We are heavier on US casualty proportionately in the portfolio. Now, we're moving into a more diversified portfolio. I think you're seeing a meaningful shift year-over-year in terms of the composition of US casualty relative to the overall insurance portfolio. And so we have similar findings in terms of elevated levels of loss activity during the year from US casualty lines, and that's the kind of data that we're taking into account on the reserve studies. Generally, speaking, we're still seeing good performance from the property and shorter tail lines in insurance. No question about that. But Juan highlighted earlier in his script that, we do have specific casualty lines that we're recalibrating. And that's one of the fundamentals of managing in a higher-risk casualty environment. You've got to ensure that you've got price adequacy, you're getting paid for the risk, and that you're also managing cycle management appropriately, which means shifting your resources to more towards more attractive lines ultimately. And when you reach that stage, I think you're better able to manage the volatility that can come from these types of macro factors like the social inflation that's a legal system abuse that's quite pervasive over the last several quarters. Juan Andrade : Meyer, this is Juan. I would add just one comment to what Mark said, particularly on your question regarding reinsurance. Please keep in mind that, our reinsurance teams are pricing actuaries. They set their own loss picks. And those loss picks are often different from the picks that we get from our clients for the same portfolios. So adverse development, particularly -- in a particular client's book doesn't necessarily mean or translate into adverse development in our reinsurance book. And I think, it's important to keep that in mind. Meyer Shields : Yeah. That is very, very helpful. Thank you, both. Just a quick question, I was looking for an update on the status of licenses in the countries where you're building out the insurance I guess, growth target? Juan Andrade : Yeah. No great question. I'm happy to say that everything is up and running now. I think in the last quarter I mentioned that we had a couple of delays. Since then, those operations are up and running. A matter of fact I've been in four continents in the last two three months with all our local teams. We're writing business. Everything is up and running. And so we're good to go with all the countries that we set out to open up to this point. Meyer Shields : Okay. Fantastic. Thank you very much. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Meyer. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Meredith, UBS. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thanks. A couple of them here, first, I'm just curious, given the shift you're seeing right now to more property from casualty is the six-point cat load still kind of a good one to think of? Or could it potentially trend a little higher given the shift you've got going on? Jim Williamson : Yeah. Brian, this is Jim Williamson. Yeah, look, I think the way we've described our expected cat losses is still relevant. We are writing a very diversified portfolio of property. We're not -- particularly when you look at our insurance business we're not overextending ourselves in peak zones. We're also being very thoughtful about how much cat exposure we're taking on a per risk basis. And I would say that we tend to write larger more highly engineered property accounts in our insurance business which by their nature are going to be less cat exposed and have less cat volatility associated with them. So while we do monitor obviously accumulation very closely it's not moving the needle on a macro basis for the company. Brian Meredith : Make sense, thanks. Mark Kociancic : Brian, sorry it's Mark. I was just going to add a couple of points to what Jim started with. So one is in the hedging program or the capital shield that we're managing in our cat program we're doing things that really emphasize better gross returns minimizing basis risk all within our risk appetite. And so I think you've got a more fulsome diversified set of PMLs by zone as Jim was mentioning. And then second probably more importantly is I think when you look at the actual performance especially relatively speaking versus peers you're going to see that our cat losses are proportionately smaller. I would argue they are meaningfully better performance than some of the others. And just take a look at our Helene loss this quarter. I think that's a good proof point. And I would also point to the 2023 performance of our reinsurance cat loss ratio relative to peers. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Make sense. Thank you. And then just one other quick one here Juan, and kind of an add-on kind of what Meyer's question was the international build-out. As we think about the insurance business going forward here we're obviously seeing the year-over-year operating expense growth slow right now obviously as that build-out is getting closer to completion. Should I think about operating expenses in the insurance units perhaps growing faster still than kind of your premiums are growing given that build-out and given what's going on with the casualty kind of call it retrenchment but just disciplined? Juan Andrade : Yeah. Brian, so this is Juan. Let me start with that. I think one of the points that Mark made earlier in his response is that you still have a little bit of a J-curve effect in the investment in the international business. But we see that earned premium starting to come online. And frankly the earned premium is coming a bit better than what we had anticipated in our own plans. So I think that's something to keep in mind. The other thing for us is that we've opened up the countries to what I've answered just to Meyer that we wanted to open at this point in time. So what you're going to see us doing particularly in 2025 is really dig in deeper into these countries that we've already made investment. And so that should help -- certainly help the growth rate the earned premiums come in from that perspective. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then assuming it's international it's largely property? Juan Andrade : It's mostly short tail. So it's -- the majority is property. We write also a lot of specialty type business, think about marine those kinds of things. But there is a component of international casualty and a component of financial lines. But you're right, depending on the region in the country, that's going to be the minority. So that's one of the points I've made in prior calls that part of the strategic reason for doing this is we do get a mix benefit on the loss ratios from this business. They tend to run significantly better because it is more property. Some of it is less CAT exposed, et cetera. Mark Kociancic : Brian, it's Mark. Sorry, just to add one point, similar to what Yaron was getting at in his second question upfront. Combined ratio guidance towards the lower end of where we are right now for the second half of 2025, that's clearly one of the factors that we foresee. So I can see a bit of stubbornness as this J curve works its way through for the next couple of quarters. But then I would expect the premium side, the net earned and the scaling to start to kick in with more impact than the actual expense growth. And that's where you would see the ratio -- expense ratio subside. Brian Meredith : That's help. Thank you. Juan Andrade : Thanks, Frank. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Michael Zaremski : Hey, good morning. A lot of questions and focus on kind of the deep dive you'll be doing on casualty in 4Q. Just curious, so if you put out the global triangles, but they're just -- they're not as helpful to most investors versus the statutory type of data that investors can see in your U.S. portfolio because on the U.S. side, you can see the loss picks by vintage and IBNR and et cetera, et cetera. So I guess it's more of a request or maybe a question too. To the extent you are doing this big deep dive, would you be willing to eventually show us your reserves on a statutory disclosure basis on a company-wide level for casualty? Is that something you consider? Mark Kociancic : Yes, Mike, it's Mark. I think we took a step forward in the 2024 disclosures in late July, early August to improve the granularity and the transparency of the reserves, and that's something that I think we'll continue to do, hopefully take another step in 2025. We definitely want to have that level of understanding in the marketplace with what's going on. And we'll obviously take this kind of feedback into account as we pursue that objective. Michael Zaremski : Okay. And maybe just a clarification on the -- I think -- I'm thinking about this correctly, but on the insurance segment, kind of the back half of 2025, guidance of closer to 92%, that is including a CAT load. But you're saying that you've been beating on CATs, right? You expect to have a small market share of catastrophes going forward. So I just want to make sure that is inclusive of CAT load, right? Mark Kociancic : That's correct. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Thank you. Mark Kociancic : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just come back to the reserves on the casualty insurance side. And just maybe just get a quick check in on how actual to expected has trended on that book here through the third quarter, just because it seems like something has changed this quarter compared to the first half. So I'm just wondering if there's anything new that you guys are seeing in the underlying book this quarter? Mark Kociancic : Hey, David, it's Mark. I would say we are seeing elevated loss activity in Q3. The loss trend itself, I think we made some general comments that it's been clearly elevated and a minor increase in the trend over the last several quarters, but the loss activity itself in U.S. casualty lines has definitely spiked somewhat in Q3. And we're seeing that principally in excess casualty, GL commercial auto. Now on the flip side, we would also -- we have a lot of other lines in insurance never mind reinsurance. And so when you're looking at things like property or even workers' comp or some of the financial lines, we're clearly seeing some favorable loss activity on that side. And so the loss activity is one factor. The reserve studies go into a whole bunch of aspects that take that into account and that's what we would expect to come out of our Q4 process. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. So yes, I guess, I do see that the mix did shift more to short-tail on the insurance book. And then I guess -- so that should have had a benefit I think on the underlying or the attritional loss ratio there. But I guess it sounds like the reason why that was flat is just higher loss ratios on the casualty side. Is that the correct interpretation of the moving pieces just in the flat attritional loss ratio in the insurance book? Mark Kociancic : Yes. Generally speaking, so a couple of points. I think the mix is intentional for a couple of reasons. One, it's more accretive or economically attractive business. We're definitely trying to improve the overall diversification of our portfolio mix. That was something we've been moving towards for quite some time and we're -- we've been able to do that with meaningful momentum both in North America, as well as adding the international portfolio. And so you're getting some favorable impacts from that mix of business shift from the reduction of the A&H portfolio actions that we've referenced throughout the quarters. And then taking into account, the impact of casualty expected loss ratios being more prudent or in line with our expectations there and that's why you don't see that much of an improvement in the combined ratio versus the comparatives despite this shift in the mix of business. David Motemaden : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Hristian Getsov with Wells Fargo Securities. Hristian Getsov : Thanks. How long do you think it will take for casualty this is reinsurance specific to firm enough in terms of just given its long tail nature for you to become more constructive? I know, it's not going to be like a huge pricing shift like we saw in property. But I guess, what do you need to see there for you to kind of return to growth in those segments? Jim Williamson : Yes Hristian, this is Jim Williamson. One thing to keep in mind, most reinsurance casualty is on a quota share basis and so what's really going to drive our view of any individual account is a couple of things. It's how much rate obviously is our client achieving? What is the composition of their portfolio? And then, what ceding commission does that deal demand to close? And so, what we've seen is obviously not all portfolios are created equal. We price each and every deal ground up. There are many deals we like. We leaned into some of those deals in 2024 and actually expanded share with core clients and then other deals just sort of don't make the grade and that's why in total our portfolio has come down a bit. So what I would expect that we need to see in order to get to a better spot would be a broader-based improvement in underlying economics. So that's more rate acceleration, which we are starting to see in some places. I think we need to see some amelioration, some of the social inflation factors that are occurring in the market. And then we need to see more improvement in ceding commissions which have come down a bit, but those take backs have been relatively modest. Hristian Getsov : Got you. Thank you, And then I know you guys said that you expect prop CAT pricing to be up call it 5% to 10% at 1/1. But could you provide a breakout of your expectations for US business versus international? Jim Williamson : Yes. Hristian, it's Jim again. Yes look, I think we're relatively -- it's relatively consistent across territories. I do think US will be up slightly more than Europe. We expect Europe to recover some pricing given, what Juan had commented on earlier, which is just this persistent issue of pretty widespread severe conductive storm, flooding, hail, et cetera is what we saw with Storm Boris. So we think a correction is needed there. There are other international markets though, that I think are in a pretty good place, where you may see more of a flat pricing environment and I would point to markets like Australia and Japan. So, it's mixed. I think the key point to take away though is, those markets that have experienced loss, we expect to be firming. And I think -- and this is a general global comment, I think Property CAT pretty much around the world, is well priced and attractive to us and we're going to continue to lean into it. Hristian Getsov : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen. Q \u2013 Andrew Kligerman : Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in there. Maybe I'll just ask a quick question. It has been interesting with the commentary we're hearing on the property markets, and Jim pointed out earlier, it's in wholesale, large global and lending. So I'm wondering of the reinsurance portfolio where you're seeing, I guess like close to 40% of your book is excess of loss, non-CAT and pro rata and then maybe in insurance about 23% -- about a quarter of the book is property short-tail stuff. Could you give us a sense of, what the proportion of the book relates to those three areas that are seeing more competition, not necessarily a specific number, but just the materiality of that business to Everest. Jim Williamson : HI, Andrew. It's Jim Williamson. So I mean, first of all when it comes to the Property CAT XOL which is a core part of our reinsurance business, you really have to separate that from the rest, because it has its own competitive dynamics and we talked about that. The pieces of the business that I would unpack for you would be, property pro rata and then our insurance property book. In property pro rata, our reinsurance portfolio, we've leaned very heavily in the US into what I would describe as more of that core casualty business I've described more E&S, where I think pricing is very strong. It's a little less susceptible to some of the factors that we described. And so ,yes, there's a portion that will be more competitive. But by and large, I think we've got the right portfolio mix. And then in insurance, I would say, it's mix. We do write middle-market property where I think prices continue to rise. We're also writing those highly engineered shared and layer deals that I talked about, where you are seeing a little more price pressure. But what's most important, is not necessarily the direction of rate. It's where we are relative to adequacy. And I would say, uniformly in all of the areas where we're writing property, we are at or in many cases well above what we consider to be adequate pricing. And so we can write all of those areas and feel good about the profit that we'll earn. Q \u2013 Andrew Kligerman : Excellent. And maybe along the same line cyber, how are you seeing pricing there, in insurance and reinsurance? And are you leaning in? Jim Williamson : Yes. So cyber pricing is sort of in a place where it continues to come down a bit. It's a very small portion of our overall portfolio in both businesses. We write a little bit more in reinsurance, where terms and conditions particularly, for cyber quota share treaties have been excellent, in particular our ability to achieve pretty tight loss ratio caps. So we still think it's attractive. We're not necessarily growing that book, but it is very attractive still. On the insurance side, prices are coming down. I think there's a little bit more sensibility around that. We did experience a period where I think prices have obviously, come up very strongly more than adequately priced. You see a little more competition. So, we're being very cautious about that though. And as I said, it's a very small portion of our insurance portfolio. Q \u2013 Andrew Kligerman : Thanks so much. Jim Williamson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Andrade for any closing comments. Juan Andrade : Thank you all for your questions and the excellent discussion today. I look forward to meeting again to discuss our fourth quarter results. Thank you and have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Rohrmann, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Everest Group Limited fourth quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. The Everest executives leading today's call are Jim Williamson, our President and CEO; and Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and CFO. We are also joined by the members of the Everest management team. Before we begin, I will preface the comments by noting that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially and we will undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted over SEC filings.

Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Available explanations or reconciliations to GAAP can be found in our earnings release and financial supplement on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Williamson : Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by addressing 2 recent tragedies : the wildfires in California and a plane crash in Washington, D.C. last Wednesday. The human toll of both events is devastating. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people, families and communities affected. We are particularly grateful to the first responders who worked tirelessly during and in the aftermath of these events. Everest stands ready to put its financial resources to work and fulfill its societal mission of aiding recovery. Both of these events remain ongoing from a loss assessment perspective. Regarding the L.A. wildfires, I would expect Everest to take a pre-tax net loss for the group of between $350 million and $450 million, equating to a 1% market share. Most of this loss will impact our Reinsurance division. We are confident in the underwriting of this exposure by both our insurance and reinsurance teams and our share of loss reflects careful client selection. Most cedents are unable to provide expected loss ranges, except in those cases where a total loss to their reinsurance program is nearly certain. As a result, this loss estimate remains a broad range based on the most widely used industry loss figures. Specific to the aviation tragedy, it's too early to provide a loss estimate for the event but we expect it to be well managed in our Q1 results. Moving on to our fourth quarter results. As we discussed last week, Everest's decisive reserve action added $1.7 billion to net reserves including over $200 million of additions to our 2024 loss picks. It's worth emphasizing that despite the impact of our reserve strengthening, Everest earned $1.3 billion in operating income for the year and achieved a 9% operating return on equity. While these results are not consistent with the goals for our company, they speak to the resilience of our business as strong income streams in reinsurance and investments more than offset needed reserve strengthening, predominantly in U.S. casualty lines. Putting aside the reserving action for a moment, let me unpack our current period business performance, starting with reinsurance, where results were once again excellent. Despite an elevated cat year, including a major hurricane in the fourth quarter, we earned $286 million and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter and year, respectively. Fourth quarter all-in combined ratio, excluding the impact of prior year favorable cat development and profit commissions due to reserve releases in our mortgage book is 91.5%. This result clearly demonstrates Everest's ability to absorb significant cat activity and still deliver. Premium growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums, was 12.6%. This is a result of strong execution with our core clients, particularly in property lines as well as selective expansion in some of our specialty underwriting areas and international business. This growth was offset by the effects of the discipline we're exercising in U.S. exposed treaty casualty. Our casualty pro rata book was down more than 7% in the quarter which really understates the extent of our disciplined actions which were offset by growth in non-U.S. casualty. Everest has been an early and consistent voice regarding the changes needed in the U.S. casualty quota share market. Ceding commissions are too high and capacity is generally available regardless of the quality of the cedent. Faced with those conditions, we've maintained our singular focus on underwriting discipline and cedent selection. To highlight the point, since the January 1, 2024, renewal, we walked away from nearly $750 million in North American casualty quota share business. Our approach in this line is simple, we conducted thorough ground-up underwriting and loss cost review of each treaty and we cut back anything that doesn't meet our return expectations, period. Moving on to the January 1, 2025, renewal where our team again executed at the highest levels. Overall, our total Reinsurance division bound premium was down by about 3% during the renewal driven mostly by the aforementioned casualty discipline which was offset by growth on the very best deals in the market, mostly in property and specialty lines. Although property cat prices were down generally between 5% and 15% for loss reprograms, overall rate levels remain above what we need to be willing to deploy capacity in most markets. An exception to my view on the property cat market is Continental Europe. European cat activity in the form of severe conductive storm, hail and flooding is clearly a rising trend. Those events drove significant annual losses. France, Germany, Italy and Eastern Europe have all been particularly affected over the last several years. After a thorough review of our modeling and analytics for these perils, we reached the conclusion that we needed to charge more for European cat exposure, in some cases, significantly more. As a result, our average modeled loss costs increased by about 10%. We fully exited over 20 deals, significantly cut back on many others, while increasing moderately on the most profitable layers and programs. Going forward, we expect the California wildfires to serve as a reminder as if one was needed to all property reinsurance underwriters of the need to maintain pricing discipline and achieve adequate rate. The global property cat reinsurance market overall remains attractive for Everest capacity. As I have said, our customers prefer to do more business with Everest when they can which means we will continue to enjoy the option of choosing where to put our capacity to work. Moving to insurance. Overall gross written premium was down marginally due to our casualty remediation, offset by growth in short tail and specialty lines. Of course, the published combined ratios for the quarter and year are unacceptable. But if you look at it purely on a current period basis, our 2024 combined ratio is 100.7%. That is certainly not good but it gives us a launching point for our portfolio remediation that we can work with. Our international operation continues to grow with a strong overall written premium increase in key short-tail and specialty lines. Despite substantial investments in people and infrastructure, the international insurance business earned an underwriting profit in 2024. Our loss ratio in that business is excellent and consistent actual versus expected data in what is largely a short-tail portfolio gives us confidence in our loss picks. In 2025, we're focused on increasing scale in the 12 markets we're operating in. We do not expect to enter additional markets this year which will result in greater premium leverage against expenses as we move forward. Finally, our North American insurance business is making great strides in remediating our casualty portfolio. Consistent with our actions in Q3, 40% of our casualty premiums in the fourth quarter were not renewed, including actions in our Everest Sports portfolio now captured in our other segments. In our ongoing insurance business, this results in a premium reduction in our U.S. specialty casualty business of approximately 23%. This is despite accelerated rate achievement in GL, auto liability and umbrella access, ranging from 14% to 27%. Loss cost inflation remained steady at an elevated level. And as we discussed last week, we will be assuming 12-plus points of average trend across those lines. Also, the last quarter affected by the runoff of our medical stop-loss business, impact in the quarter was $75 million. Our team in the field has done a good job pipelining and underwriting a number of large risk management accounts. These are well structured with sophisticated clients who understand the need to manage exposure in a heavy social inflation environment. Recent wins in this business include a multiline solution for a leading global industrial firm, property cross-sell to an existing casualty account in the public advocacy arena and a large deductible casualty program for a consumer products company. We set ourselves apart from the competition on these deals through the quality of our relationships, breadth of our offering and specialized services. Results of our portfolio remediation, coupled with the targeted growth are already being reflected in our data. Our Specialty Casualty business made up 25% of our global insurance premiums in Q4 down from over 30% 1 year ago and the quality of the accounts has improved dramatically. As I said on our pre-release call, we will take no credit in our loss picks for this but I certainly expect it to yield increasing margin over time. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials in more detail. Mark Kociancic : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. As we discussed last week, 2024 was a pivotal year of transformation for Everest. We took decisive action to fortify our U.S. casualty reserves following a comprehensive reserve review and it's reflected in our fourth quarter 2024 results. Looking at the group results, Everest reported gross written premiums of $4.7 billion, representing 7.2% growth in constant dollars and excluding reinstatement premiums. The combined ratio was 135.5% for the quarter. This includes unfavorable development of prior year loss reserves of $1.5 billion or 37.6 points on the combined ratio. We also strengthened current accident year losses by $229 million with total strengthening of $1.7 billion for the full year and fourth quarter 2024. Net losses in the quarter contributed 5.3 points to the combined ratio, largely driven by Hurricane Milton. We also had releases on prior year events, largely driven by Hurricane Ian which partially offset cat losses this quarter which, as a reminder, run through the catastrophe line in the segment P&L. I would also note that the prior year quarter had much lower than average cat capacity; the group attritional loss ratio was 63.9%, a 490 basis point increase over the prior year's quarter. This reflects the current accident year strengthening I mentioned a few moments ago, primarily within our insurance segment. The group's commission ratio was 21.2% when excluding the impact of 1.8 points from the profit commissions associated with favorable reserve development in the reinsurance segment related to the mortgage business and consistent with the prior year. The group expense ratio was 6.2% in the quarter as we continue to invest in talent and systems within both franchises. Moving to the segment results and starting with reinsurance. Reinsurance gross premiums grew 12.6% in constant dollars when adjusting for reinstatement premiums during the quarter. The strong growth was primarily driven by strong double-digit increases in property pro rata and property cat XOL, partially offset by continued discipline in casualty lines. For the full year 2024, property cat XOL grew approximately 26.2% versus the prior year. Combined ratio was 90.4% in the fourth quarter. The prior year fourth quarter combined ratio of 78.9% included 15.3 points of favorable prior year reserve development. As you saw in our press release last week, favorable development in property and mortgage lines fully offset reserve strengthening in U.S. casualty lines. Catastrophe losses contributed 5.4 points to the combined ratio in the quarter consistent with the prior year. This quarter's cat losses were largely driven by $275 million of losses from Hurricane Milton and were partially offset by $125 million of releases on prior year events, namely Hurricane Ian. Attritional loss ratio improved 90 basis points to 56.9% which was primarily driven by mix as we continue to grow strongly in property cat XOL and reduce our casualty pro rata business. Attritional combined ratio improved 140 basis points to 83.7% when excluding the impact of $68 million in profit commissions associated with favorable mortgage reserve development this quarter. The prior year quarter included $94 million of profit commission related to loss reserve releases in mortgage lines. Normalized commission ratio was 24% when you exclude the 2.3 points attributed to the profit commissions associated with favorable development in reinsurance. The underwriting related expense ratio was 2.5%, consistent with the prior year. Moving to Insurance; gross premiums written decreased 1.6% in constant dollars to $1.4 billion, driven by our decisive actions to shed underperforming U.S. casualty business. We are targeting growth in the most accretive lines to improve the portfolio quality and further diversify the book. We made meaningful progress this quarter with property and specialty lines each growing above 30% in the quarter. This growth was offset by the aggressive underwriting action we are taking in specialty casualty lines centered around U.S. casualty lines as well as the runoff of our A&H medical stop-loss business which was completed in Q4. As you saw in our press release last week, we strengthened U.S. casualty prior year reserves in our recently redefined insurance segment by approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter. We also strengthened current accident year losses by $206 million which is reflected in the increased attritional loss ratio of 84% this quarter and 68.1% for the full year 2024. Combined ratio also included 5.3 points of catastrophe losses, primarily driven by losses from Hurricane Milton, while the prior year fourth quarter benefited from a relatively benign level of cat losses. Commission ratio increased 100 basis points, largely driven by business mix and the underwriting related expense ratio was 17.9% with the increase largely driven by the continued investment in our global platform and slower earned premium growth as we rationalize our U.S. casualty portfolio. We recently formed our other segment to enhance disclosure around non-core lines of business, strengthened reserves by $425 million in the quarter which includes an increase of $22 million to current accident year losses. The other segment includes $1.1 billion of net reserves. Moving on, net investment income increased to $473 million for the quarter, driven primarily by higher assets under management. Alternative assets generated $41 million of net investment income which was in line with the prior year. Overall, our book yield was stable at 4.7% and our reinvestment rate is just north of 5%. We continue to have a short asset duration of approximately 3.1 years and the fixed income portfolio benefits from an average credit rating of AA-. Our investment portfolio remains well positioned for the current environment. For the fourth quarter of 2024, our operating income tax rate was minus 16.6% which was lower than our working assumption of 11% to 12% for the year due to the net operating loss this quarter. However, the full year operating effective tax rate was 9% which is closer to our expected range. Shareholders' equity ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, or $14.7 billion, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale fixed income securities. At the end of the quarter, net after-tax unrealized losses on the available-for-sale fixed income portfolio equates to approximately $849 million, an increase of $629 million as compared to the end of the third quarter and this was driven by increases in the treasury yield curve. Cash flow from operations was $780 million during the quarter and approximately $5 billion for the full year. Book value per share ended the quarter at $322.97, an improvement of 8.7% from year-end 2023 when adjusted for dividends of $7.75 per share year-to-date. Book value per share, excluding net unrealized depreciation on available for sale fixed income securities stood at $342.7 and versus $320.95 per share at year-end 2023, representing an increase of approximately 6.8%. Our full year 2024 total shareholder return was 9.2%. Net debt leverage at quarter end stood at 15.6%, modestly lower from year-end 2023. Everest continues to have a strong financial position. We are focused on achieving our mid-teens total shareholder return over the cycle. We are well positioned to execute our strategic initiatives and we will look to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares this year and this quarter specifically. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Matthew Rohrmann : Thanks, Mark. Dave, we are now ready to open the line for questions. We do ask you please limit your questions to 1 question plus 1 followup, then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Gregory Peters : For my first question, I'm going to focus on the insurance segment. And I'm wondering if you could give us some additional detail on how you plan to manage volatility considering that you're non-renewing all this casualty business and you'll have rising exposures to the property short-tail business in the international segment. Jim Williamson : Greg, this is Jim. Thanks for the question. Look, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, we're very diligent around P&L management in each of our divisions and we're very careful about how we plan for the coming year, for example, on where we're going to deploy capital and at what terms and conditions. We also very strategically, as you can imagine, in our insurance business, leverage the use of outbound reinsurance to manage per risk as well as overall volatility. And so while the short-tail book in the insurance division is growing very nicely as you would have seen in this quarter and we're happy about it. We're happy about the pricing levels and the quality of the accounts we're writing. In terms of moving our overall group risk profile; it's really not moving the needle at this point. And as it continues to grow, we'll just manage it within our general PML framework. So not something that is outside of our ability to very thoughtfully approach. Gregory Peters : Okay. My follow-up question is on the capital management comments. Mark, you -- well, in the press release, you acknowledged that you didn't buy any stock back during the quarter. I assume that's because of the review issue. Can you give us sort of some framework about what your budget looks like for capital management activities? Should we think about it in terms of a payout ratio with dividends and share repurchase on total income for the year? Or perhaps just give us some framework on how we should be thinking about that. Mark Kociancic : Greg, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. I think there's a lot of factors that go into it. So if you start with, obviously, the fact we have, I think, still a strong financial position coming out of year-end 2024 despite the significant reserve charge and we've got a very good earnings engine in the company. Last week, we made the guidance of mid-teens full shareholder return over the cycle. We feel confident about that as an immediate objective and something that's set for 2025. A few other points. I think the growth rate of the company is one factor that goes into the equation, being able to execute our organic plan. That's something we feel confident you're seeing us being cautious with casualty on the reinsurance side, disciplined, in particular, on the insurance side and property remains very attractive as to other specialty lines. But I do think you'll see less overall growth than in some prior years. And that will free up resources, I think, for more capital management type actions. And then lastly, I think when you get into the equation, obviously, the attractiveness of our share price at the present time creates a very compelling incentive to buy back so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I fully expect us to be active this quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Jim, I want to drill down a little bit in terms of, I guess, what, on the outside, we can expect in terms of Insurance segment loss ratio progress. In other words, I understand the sustained 12% plus loss trend for casualty lines. But should we expect things like the runoff of the weaker portfolios or other business mix issues? Is that going to show up in 2025? Jim Williamson : Yes. Meyer, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. So we definitely provided a little bit of insight around this during the pre-release call and I think there are 2 key points. Number one, the prudence that we applied in the construction of the reserve actions that we took as well as the topping off of the 2024 loss fix is a level of prudence that we plan on continuing in 2025. And you'll see that in how we select our casualty loss picks during this year. But we also indicated, I think it is very important that mechanically, mix is moving quite quickly. And of course, that's -- as I indicated in my prepared remarks, that aspect of it in terms of the shift of mix is already showing up in our data. And so yes, as mix improves, the total loss ratio, obviously, that's a very positive tailwind for us to think about as we move through 2025. Mark Kociancic : Meyer, this is Mark. Just one point on Jim's remarks. So if you look at our financial supplement on the Insurance segment, you'll see a current year loss ratio -- attritional loss ratio of 68.3%. And that obviously takes into account the current year strengthening for 2024. And that's with remediation underway in the casualty segment and a mix of business that is moving towards a more balanced portfolio as we shed some of the casualty numbers. So I think that's kind of the starting point for where the portfolio was. Now to your point, obviously, there are still unearned premium that is earning out into 2025 with some of the older casualty business that we likely will not renew and that will be a bit of a drag in 2025 but that's something we've expected, we forecasted and we clearly have 2 other pieces that I would say are favorable. So one is the mix of business aspect that Jim mentioned. And then the second is really the approach we're taking to the casualty account renewals and new business in general in terms of rate. So I see those as favorable -- two favorable impacts that will help that loss ratio development improve year-over-year and still respect the loss trend assumption we gave last week, plus the prudence actions that we indicated that are going to be taking place in U.S. liability in particular. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. That's very helpful. Second question, it sounds like some casualty lines are improving rapidly. When you look at that, there may be a business you don't want to write in 2025 but maybe by 2026, it's good enough. So are you maintaining, I guess, full run rate expenses in anticipation of eventual profitability? I just -- I'm not sure how that aspect of expense management plays in. Jim Williamson : Well, yes. So if your question is, are we continuing to invest in our business very thoughtfully, the answer is yes. Now we're also very prudent expense managers, as you clearly see in the overall group expense ratio in our Reinsurance business. Obviously, insurance expense ratio is elevated slightly because of the investments we're making as well as the impact the remediation has on earned premium. But as we go forward, I'd expect that phenomenon to sort of persist for a while because there are great opportunities for us to make prudent investments in the business and the remediation puts a little bit of a lid on some earned premium. But we're going to manage it very carefully, Meyer, on a quarter-by-quarter basis to ensure that the level of investments we're making is consistent with our ability to generate the margin we need. Operator : And the next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Josh Shanker : In the prepared remarks and whatnot in addition to the sports book being sold, you're also exiting the medical stop loss business. Why or why not is the medical stop loss business a business that I can't be taking care of in a one renewal type methodology like the rest of the businesses? Why can you just raise the price in the business that sticks sticks and what leaves leaves? Jim Williamson : Yes, Josh, it's Jim. Thanks for the question. We essentially non-renewed a major block, the block that was causing us difficulties in our medical stop-loss business at the beginning of 2024. And it is a block but it has renewal dates that occur throughout the year. So it wasn't a matter of getting increased price. We didn't want to be on the business, we non-renewed it and it just takes the year for the full impact to the financials to run through which is now done. So we won't be talking about the runoff of medical stop loss in 2025. Josh Shanker : All right. And another quick one. Obviously, I think it's very clear, your thoughts about the wildfire as it regards you were booked. And as a general rule, should we think about Everest as being a 1% market share loss of major global events? Or is there more ground up sort of analysis in how you're thinking about your exposure to California wildfires? Jim Williamson : Sure, Josh. Jim again. Good question. Look, this is this 1% market share that we've indicated for this event is the result of exceptional underwriting. The simple fact is there are a number of large contributors to what will be an industry loss of -- pick whatever number you like, we're kind of in the 35% to 45% range. Some others like different numbers, that's fine. But a number of the major contributors to that industry loss are not clients of Everest. And the reason they're not clients of Everest is because we assessed the programs on offer and did not believe they offered us an adequate risk-adjusted return for the exposure involved. So we said no and others said yes. And so you'll see different market shares, et cetera which is a ground-up result of the underwriting actions that get taken. There could be an entirely different loss in an entirely different market where we get different opportunities and it will result in a different market share of the loss. It's not about trying to create peanut butter and outcome. It's pursuing the best quality deals for all of the perils we take and all the different geographies we compete in all day, every day. I mean, that's what we do here. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Scott with Barclays. Alex Scott : I thought I'd ask you what your view is of the impact of the wildfires just on reinsurance pricing and as you kind of head into midyear, what do you anticipate -- I mean, maybe also any comments you have on how it affects your aggregate treaty setting in the wind season? Jim Williamson : Yes. Alex, it's Jim. So look, I think obviously, this is a pretty -- this is a big event. And whether you like the $35 billion number or $45 billion number or you prefer a number bigger than that. This is a major event. That certainly -- you would expect it to have a positive impact on prices. What I tend to hear from people is that if there was a move to decrease rates in a reasonable fashion at 1/1 which I indicated, we've seen 5% to 15% of loss-free programs, that's probably ameliorated. Obviously, it will take time for that to play out. But look, I think you add that with the fact that a lot of our clients are looking to buy more overall cover. There's a lot of increased demand in the market. And then you further look at the fact that those clients, if they have their choice, would rather do more of that cover with Everest. I think that means there's a terrific opportunity for us to continue to be very, very selective in the deals we're writing and to get terrific economics which I think is a very favorable thing. You mentioned aggregate deals. I don't know if you mentioned just our total exposure or you meant aggregate specifically, we're not a writer of aggregate covers for the most part. In terms of our total deployed capacity, if pricing is very attractive, we're ready, willing, able to do more for sure. If pricing is not as attractive, we do less. I mean that's -- again, that's how we manage our renewal cycles as they come. Alex Scott : That's really helpful. Second one I wanted to ask was just around as we approach the Schedule P type disclosures that you all provided in your 10-K and also just thinking through some of the conversations you probably had with your investor base coming away from the initial pre-announcement of the reserve actions. I mean, is there anything that you would point to us that we should focus on beyond just some of the basics around paid to incurs and trying to understand some of those things. As we go in and we're comparing contrast and all of that, what do you think is the key to focus on and sort of, I guess, proof points around the actions that have been taken being enough? Mark Kociancic : Alex, it's Mark. So look, I think there are several factors to take into account. We tried to outline a bunch of them last week in our pre-call presentation and narrative. So several metrics on IBNR, the ultimate loss ratios. Ultimately, the global loss triangles, I think, supply the best granular data that you can use to compare. So for me, I mean, that's the best place to start. You'll get probably a bit more out of the cake but that part is going to give you, I think, what you ultimately will need. The second thing is really the commentary we've given on highlighting how that book has developed. So specific classes of business that we're problematic how we've gone about shaping the portfolio going forward. And I think that discipline and the commentary we're giving on a quarterly basis that reinforces the execution of our plan here on the remediation is critical to getting the confidence. And then when you get these quarterly measurements such as the K or the Q or the GLTs on an annual basis, you'll be able to see more clearly how the IBNRs outstanding stack up, how the ULRs are looking, just the overall business performance. And so, I think that will give you -- that combination will give you the confidence level you're going to need over time. Operator : The next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I had a question, it sounds like we've heard as well from some of your peers, just the conditions in the casualty re market have caused you guys to step back which makes sense. I guess I'm wondering, it sounds like you guys non-renewed $750 million throughout the course of '24. It sounds like that's continued here at 1/1. I'm wondering if you can help us think through just holistically, what sort of cat load we should be thinking about for Everest now that there's been a more -- a bigger shift towards property and short-tail lines from casualty? Mark Kociancic : So David, it's Mark. The cat load is still broadly consistent in the multiyear approach we've taken since 2020. What we have done and we started a couple of years ago is really trying to make more of our gross exposure net. And so we had a fairly large reliance or impact from our cat bond issuance over the last several years and prior to 2020 and so we've reduced our reliance on those and we're taking more of the gross on a net basis now. So you're seeing that appetite expand naturally because we believe the expected returns are still very attractive. I don't think the growth is growing very much. It's really more of a net that is expanding primarily because of the cat bonds. Jim Williamson : Yes, David, this is Jim. I think that's spot on. Let me just step back for a moment, though and approach it a little bit in terms of how we think about the cat book itself because the way we do this is really straightforward. I mean we're trying to build a cat book that is high margin and also very resilient to loss. So that in the event that there is an outsized cat loss somewhere in the world or you have a pretty big cat like a California wildfire that you don't necessarily expect a wildfire to be $40 billion or $50 billion, et cetera, you can still have a book that can earn a profit. And in my mind, yes, the fact that there's less casualty in the denominator can move the percentage of how you think about the cat load. But the fact is what we're trying to do is build a cat book that can manage its own losses and still turn a profit. And we've had multiple years now where there have been really outsized industry losses and the year of Ian is a good example where we essentially in that year which was a big year for cat losses, we got to a breakeven piece in our cat book. And that's at the core of what we're doing here. So I get the modeling aspects and the earned premium aspects but it's about cat management to get to the outcomes we want. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. I appreciate that color. My follow-up question, also just on the casualty reinsurance book. And it sounds like some of your peers have made an effort to enhance the flow of information and data capture with their cedents. Have you guys been doing something similar and stepped up your engagement with your cedents? If so, how far along in that process are you? Any findings you can share would be helpful. Jim Williamson : Yes. I mean, absolutely. That's been a discipline of ours very consistently over the last several years, ensuring best quality data from all of our customers. And look, I think it goes well beyond just making sure that the renewal submissions are complete. For us, it's about having direct actuary to actuary discussions with incremental data sharing so that we can really understand the trends that are affecting our cedents books. Its claims to claims, conversations during the course of the year so that we understand how they're managing their claims volumes, what they're seeing in that underlying data. We obviously study all publicly available data very carefully. So it's multifaceted. It's been a consistent discipline of ours. Obviously, we welcome our competitors joining in that approach because it just will further enhance the data available to everyone. But I think fundamentally, if we really want to move the needle on data quality and availability further, it's going to be about making sure that we're only deploying capacity to those clients who can demonstrate in their data that they're doing a good job managing their portfolios. Where we don't see that, we're moving away, whether that's the data itself doesn't look good or the data doesn't exist, that's not for us. So that's very fundamental to the discipline we're exercising. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Mark, any updates on what you think the tax rate will look like in 2025? Mark Kociancic : Yes. So I would estimate a range. Clearly, that's higher than the 11% to 12% as we have a 15% rate coming into Bermuda. I would estimate our range -- working range to be somewhere in the 17% to 18% effective tax rate for the group as a whole. And that would assume kind of a normal distribution of geographic income. Obviously, cat fall or any other kind of large loss type impacts can skew it but I'd say it's something like that. And that's the overall tax rate. Brian Meredith : Appreciate it. That's helpful. And then a second question also, just any thoughts on what cash flow could look like this year given some of the actions you're taking with the portfolio? We expect it to be below 2024? Mark Kociancic : I think we'll be in a similar range. We have outperformed our expected cash flow forecasts for the plans for the last few years. So I've been pleasantly surprised with that. I'd say one of the biggest factors is really natural catastrophes. I think our reserve or loss payment patterns are pretty good in that respect for what we're projecting in 2025. And it's probably the cat fall that will determine whether or not we hit something close to the $5 billion this year. Operator : The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on the California fire losses, right? So you guys came out with a range that a little bit less right from what we saw from some other rangers that have gone as high as $50 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense of what would be like the discrepancy between your insured loss estimate and others. And I thought -- I'm assuming you guys -- I think you said you don't have a lot of losses from cedents right now. So can you just verify that last comment? And then just help us reconcile why your insured range might be a little bit less than what some other reinsurers are seeing? Jim Williamson : Yes. Elyse, it's Jim. Well, I don't know how other people get to their numbers, so I can't really reconcile it for you. But what I can say is if you look at the industry loss estimates that are floating around, there is a pretty broad range on it. I think we're kind of on the upper end of the types of numbers I've seen, if you like, $50 billion better than our loss, I would expect it to be roughly $500 million. The reason why I'm feeling pretty good about the range that I described earlier and I feel great about the performance of our team vis-\u00e0-vis that market share number is because of the quality of the underwriting that took place. And I can't emphasize this enough. We passed up deliberately for very specific reasons on a number of deals that got completely clobbered in this event and that's how you ladder upgraded underwriting over time. So very proud of what the team has done that way. And look, obviously, we're in conversations with our teams. I think the issue is loss adjusting an event like this is very challenging. There have been public access issues that are pretty well described, I think it will take time for people to hone in their own numbers which is why we're still working with a range and not a point estimate. But I'm pretty confident given what we are on and what we are not on in the numbers that I shared with you earlier. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up is on reserves. Looking at the presentation that you guys provided last week on your reinsurance casualty reserves and then also on your insurance casualty reserves. And it does look like the accident year loss pick for recent years in your casualty reinsurance book are being booked substantially better than casualty insurance. Can you just kind of talk through what would be causing the difference between those? Maybe it's business mix? Just trying to reconcile, right, why you'd be booking U.S. casualty reinsurance significantly better than insurance. And then have you guys said what loss cost you're assuming for your casualty reinsurance book? Jim Williamson : Yes. Elyse, it's Jim again. Look, I mean, the explanation is pretty straightforward and I'm going to be blunt. Our clients for our reinsurance portfolio, we've been very selective in our cedent selection process. They are top quartile underwriters of casualty and they've demonstrated very consistently that they outperformed the average loss ratio in the market by a substantial margin. We've seen that in our data. We see that in the submissions for the renewals. And obviously, wherever we don't continue to see that, we move away which is why we've moved away from $750 million of business. And that's why you get to a loss ratio that looks the way it does. And then you contrast that with our insurance business was not top quartile, overconcentrated in certain classes, et cetera, that get you to a much worse outcome. So there's really not a linkage between the 2 that you should have in your mind. It's 2 entirely different portfolios. In terms of expected trend level, I mean, we are very prudent across both divisions and, I would say, consistent across both divisions. That doesn't mean the number will always be the same but the approach is very consistent. It's based on the data. It's based on, I think, a very conservative view of the development of the casualty market. Mark Kociancic : Yes. Elyse, just a couple of points on that last piece on the loss trend. So we gave a figure last week in the pre-call on Tuesday, roughly an average of 12% for excess umbrella, GL and commercial auto. So depending on the mix of business, it's something approaching that for both sides of the equation, reinsurance and insurance. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO. Unidentified Analyst : It's Dan [ph] on for Mike. Just maybe going back to the insurance loss ratio, we could see looking at the deck last week, it was running about low to mid-90s now. Just wondering if you could maybe quantify how much worse of a loss ratio is associated with the non-renewed business versus the retained business. Mark Kociancic : Mike [ph], it's Mark. It varies -- it really varies by line. I will say, let me break it down into a few components for you. So I would start with the other segment which contains that sports and leisure book that we essentially put into runoff. That for us, I think, was the most disappointing and you're looking at a triple-digit type of loss ratio. It's predominantly excess and GL lines of business. And then when you get into some of the other classes of business having the insurance segment, you've got a varying range of ultimate loss ratios. So in some cases, you're dealing with the triple digits, the 100, 110, 120 type levels. You've clearly got other classes of casualty that are performing much better than that. It really varies. And clearly, we're focused on rate adequacy there. So in terms of the renewal process going forward, we're on this with just a laser focus and making sure that it's either non-renewed or it's renewed with the rate that's necessary. Unidentified Analyst : Then maybe could you walk through that same dynamic maybe for the $750 million you walked away from in reinsurance casualty? Jim Williamson : Yes, sure, Dan [ph]. It's Jim. Look, it's going to be -- it's going to very much ideal. And I'm not going to characterize it in terms of a number. But I will tell you -- in some cases, because remember, we started with a pretty high-quality book of ceding. So we're not dealing with the types of challenges that Mark described relative to our insurance business. It's more of just when you evaluate the whole portfolio, there's clearly cedents who in our -- from our perspective, maybe they're not keeping up with trend, or there's something in their claims process that we feel is not fit for purpose at this moment in the casualty cycle and with the challenges of social inflation. It could be they have expanded their appetite in a way that we don't think is favorable. So it's not always that there's this major distinction or inferior loss ratio relative to our average portfolio. It's the underwriting that indicates to us that we're not going to have the confidence we want to have going forward but not nearly the same deltas and performance as what Mark described. Operator : The next question comes from Wes Carmichael with Autonomous Research. Wes Carmichael : In your commentary on capital management, Mark, I think there was a high-level comment on less growth overall which, I guess, is understandable currently. But is there any framing you can do on how you're thinking about top line going forward, especially if you're thinking about the potentially non-renewed business, what's the kind of underlying growth you're thinking about going forward? Mark Kociancic : Wes, so we're not providing guidance. I think from a qualitative standpoint, you've seen us be pretty disciplined on the casualty shedding or underwriting in terms of the reinsurance segment, that's going to continue. Clearly, there are pockets of casualty. I expect us to add in the normal course of business. It's not all a shedding story, both sides, reinsurance and insurance. And property remains very attractive. I mean, the rate adequacy is clearly there and that's something we definitely want to lean into where it makes sense. I just don't see the same level of growth that we had, for example, a couple of years ago in both sides. Last point, our international insurance business has been growing double digits for quite some time. Broadly speaking, lion's share of it is a short-tail book and it's been performing very well. And I would expect that type of natural growth to continue as we're relatively small in the market and starting from a small base. And so that's something that I would expect to be a positive for us in 2025. Wes Carmichael : That's helpful. And I think there was a release last [indiscernible] for Everest. Can you just talk about how strategic it is for Everest to maintain its current ratings? Mark Kociancic : Sorry, you cut out for a second. Wes, a release you said? Wes Carmichael : Yes. I think S&P changed its outlook to negative. I'm just wondering how maintaining its -- maintaining ratings right now is to Everest strategically? Mark Kociancic : Well, it's fundamental to offer the A+ financial strength rating and that's clearly secure, not in danger at all. The S&P negative outlook is something we respect. We'll work with them not something that concerns us very much but clearly something we have to manage. But the overall financial strength is in a solid spot. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
