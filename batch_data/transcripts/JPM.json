Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everybody. As I\u2019ll go, I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of the presentation. So starting on page one, the firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the first quarter, a $1.28 a share with the return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $24 billion, down 8% year-on-year driven by lower markets revenue down 17% and continued headwinds in mortgage. Reported expenses for the firm were basically the same as adjusted expenses this quarter at $14.6 billion, in line with our expectations and our guidance for full year adjusted expenses to be below $59 billion. Firm-wide legal expense for the quarter was immaterial. Of note, you will see that we didn\u2019t disclose any significant items this quarter on the front page of the presentation. There were items in the quarter that we consider non-core or non-recurring, each individually didn't rise to the level of being disclosed on the front page and importantly, the net of all such items across businesses was not significant to the firm\u2019s reported results. To be clear, this means that our reported net income of $5.3 billion is very close to being a core performance number, which we consider a solid result given the challenging environment for those markets and mortgage. Importantly, underlying drivers across most businesses continued among impressive trends. Finally, we are pleased that our capital plan was approved in the quarter and the Board announced its intention to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 a share effective in the second quarter, as well as the authorization to repurchase a gross $6.5 billion of common equity or net a little over $5 billion, that is net of expected employee issuance. So skipping over page two and turning to page three. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.5% flat to last quarter, being over 40 basis points of capital generate and run-off in the quarter, largely offset by the impact of certain specific risk models that were approved to use in Basel I last year, but which our regulators disapproved for use under Basel III effective at the beginning of this year. We believe this should largely be timing with past remediation in the second half of 2014 and further remediation in 2015. The impact of these models approval was contemplated in our Investor Day guidance of reaching 10% plus by the year end, but it won\u2019t be in a linear fashion and the majority of capital accretion will occur in the second half of the year. Effective this quarter our regulatory reported ratio moves from a Basel I measure to a Basel III standardized transitional measure. And having been approved to exit Basel parallel effective 1st of April starting in the second quarter, the common floor would apply. This means there are variety of measures we could talk about but suffice to say there were hundreds of bases points above the minimum to any of them. Therefore our primary ratio will continue to be one we use to manage the place , which also happens to be our lowest, the fully phased in Basel III advanced ratio of 9.5%. Before we leave the page, I want to spend a minute on leverage. You\u2019ll notice that the firm and the bank SLR progressed by 50 and 70 basis points, respectively, and importantly, that the firm is above 5% today. The firm\u2019s ratio benefited from net retained earnings, as well as from preferred issuance of close to $4 billion as we took advantage of market opportunities in the first quarter. The bank\u2019s ratio benefited from both retained earnings, as well as the impact of actions taken including down-streaming and restructuring of certain capital to the bank. Additionally, other leverage actions taken across our businesses helped the firm and the bank by 10 basis points. We also analyzed rule proposed by regulators this past Tuesday. In general, it was relatively consistent with the Basel proposal, which is how we based our estimate. There were a couple of newer technical changes, the net of those changes we estimated to add approximately 15 to 20 basis points to leverage which is included in the ratios reported on the page. Returning to the business performance, I am moving on page four, the Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $1.9 billion of net income for the quarter on $10.5 billion of revenue and an ROE of 15%. Overall, revenue was down both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by mortgage banking, which I will talk about later. Despite margin compression across CCB, excluding mortgage, revenue was flat year-on-year as we continue to add new customers and deepen our relationships with them. Deposits were up $30 billion year-on-year. We had record client investment assets of $196 billion, up 16% and credit cost sales volumes of $105 billion, was up 10% year-on-year being the 24th consecutive quarter that sales outperformed the industry. Expense was down $350 million year-on-year and close to $900 million quarter-on-quarter despite the ongoing investment in control. Reduction was also driven by mortgage as well as by the timing of certain investments in marketing and costs. And across CCB, we are on track relative to our headcount reduction outlined at Investor Day. On Page 5, Consumer and Business Banking. Business generated $740 million of net income and ROE of 27%, on $4.4 billion of net revenue, up 5% year-on-year and down 1% from the prior quarter seasonally. Net interest income was up over 5% year-on-year, driven by deposit growth of 9% among the highest in the industry. We saw strong household growth and the lowest attrition ever this quarter. While the deposit margin flattened quarter-over-quarter, it did decline 9 basis points over last year, driven by lower reinvestment rate. On the non-interest revenue side, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and in investment revenue, driven by the record client investment asset I mentioned. Expense is up 1% year-on-year reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in the business, including the cost relating to strengthening the control and compliance infrastructure, partially offset by improving efficiency in our branches. CBB headcount was down around 1500 this quarter. On Business Banking originations, we\u2019re beginning to see stronger lending with production for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. We have the right team in place and targeted strategies which have proved successful. We\u2019re also seeing improved banking productivity. So although some challenges remain in the environment, pipeline is strong and at the highest levels since 2012 and utilization rates have stabilized. So we are cautiously optimistic that improved lending trends will continue in 2014. Turning to Page 6, Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million for the quarter. Despite a relatively favorable rate environment, the market got off to a slow start in 2014. We\u2019re seeing tight housing inventory in some markets and the purchase market was affected adversely by the severe weather. This led to a challenging quarter to the mortgage business with production of $17 billion, down 27% quarter-over-quarter and 68% over last year. On the back of this lower volume, reduction pretax excluding repurchases was a loss of $186 million consistent with our guidance. We did, however, continue to make good progress on rightsizing capacity and reducing expenses, with production core expense being lower by over $110 million quarter-on-quarter. Total Mortgage Banking headcount was down nearly 3000 since the end of the year and about 14,000 since the beginning of last year. Mortgage production also benefited from a repurchase reserve release. Repurchases for the quarter was positive $128 million principally driven by a significant improvement in actual and projected cure rates for the remaining repurchase risks. Before I move off of production, just briefly on market share. As we pointed out at Investor Day, the pricing of business reflects the inherent risk. The risk of the default and cost associated with servicing defaulted loans is significantly higher for high LTD loans. As a result of pricing actions taken, we believe we may have lost some share in the first quarter while we\u2019ve remained discipline with respect to appropriate risk adjusted returns. And this is consistent with our objective to have a smaller higher quality, less volatile mortgage business in the future. Now onto servicing, excluding MSR risk management, pretax income of $131 million was favorable by over $100 million quarter-on-quarter. That was driven by the absence of an adjustment to compensatory fees which we incurred in the fourth quarter. If we exclude this item servicing, pretax remains relatively flat and we remain on track to deliver servicing expense of $500 million plus or minus by the fourth quarter of this year. MSR risk management was a net loss for the quarter of about $400 million. The loss was driven by negative $460 million fair value adjustments, principally on higher allocated capital for the business in line with the capital we showed at Investor Day. Lastly on real estate portfolios, pretax income of $517 million include $174 million of charge-off and an NCI reserve release for the quarter of $200 million in line with guidance. You will see the net charge-off were broadly flat to the fourth quarter on flattening delinquencies at the end of last year and the early part of the first quarter. While we do expect improvement in loss trend to resume in the second quarter as recent delinquency trend have been positive. Lastly on mortgage, the NCI portfolio remains flat. We added $3.5 billion of loans this quarter. Turning to Page 7, Card, Merchant Services and Auto have net income of $1.1 billion, down 15% year-on-year with an ROE of 23% while 20% if you exclude reserve releases. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 3% seasonally quarter-on-quarter and 4% year-on-year driven by continued margin compressions from growth in transacted balances and from the paydown of higher yielding run-off loans. Underlying trends remain robust. Strong sales and merchant processing volumes up 10% and 11% respectively in gaining share. Total outstanding remain approximately flat for us and for the industry and we have strong momentum in new account originations in the quarter, up 24% year-on-year and the quality of our new account origination is very strong. Expense was down $260 million while 12% quarter-on-quarter due to the timing of marketing spend as well as the absence of remediation payments to customers that was recorded in the fourth quarter. The net charge-off rate has remained very low at 293 basis points picking up slightly quarter-over-quarter just some seasonality of loan balances. We released $200 million of card loan loss reserve this quarter in line with guidance and $50 million of student lending reserve. And before we move on, a few words on auto, we saw a very strong industry rebound in March with the highest new auto sales since 2007, coming off of the slowest start to the year again on the severe winter. This drove originations up 3% year-on-year and loan balances up 5% gaining share and it was the 10th consecutive quarter of auto loan and lease growth. Moving onto Slide 8 on the Corporate and Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. You will see on the table on the top right of the slide that we\u2019ve shown adjusted results for comparable periods excluding DVA and FVA. The net DVA/FVA impact of this quarter was an insignificant loss. Growth DVA would have been over $200 million negative on 9 basis point tightening of CBS spreads. So I\u2019ve expected what we saw was a sensitivity to our spread significantly muted given the implementation of FVA. And you should expect the impact of DVA-FVA in our results to continue to be modest going forward all other things equal. In banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 8% year-on-year. IB fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees but with lower debt underwriting fees. And we maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees as per Dealogic. Going forward, the environment remains compelling to M&A with announced volume up 20%. We have a robust pipeline of IPOs, with the large backlog across sectors and regions and DCM activity is expected to be relatively stable. Lending revenues was down $200 million year-over-year and down quarter-over-quarter. But mark-to-market gains on securities drove the variance in both prior periods. We also had treasury services revenue of a $1 billion, down 3% year-on-year with higher net interest income on higher deposits, offset by the impacts of business simplification and lower trade loans and spreads. Moving on to Markets and Investor Services, the challenging environment and lower client volumes we talked about at Investor Day continues through the end of the quarter, ending with overall market revenues, down 17% year-on-year. And there was no discernible single driver of the weakness. It was across product and regions. In general, it feels like the market consensus at the quarter beginning, which for a growth story didn\u2019t transpire. And combined with several other factors, this led to generally lower levels of client activity across the board. We didn\u2019t see a meaningful pickup in activity in markets reasonable to expect, but some of its third quarter softness may continue in April. Security Services revenue of a $1 billion was up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposit and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. And you see the credit adjustment of other line items show the negative $197 million, which includes the net DVA/FVA loss, together with the impact of changes in CVA. The credit environment continues to be benign and we believe our exposure to Russia is manageable. We are totally reserved based on what we know today and we are closely monitoring the situation. Expense came down 8% year-on-year to $5.6 billion, lower compensation given lower revenue driving the decline. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 33%, broadly in line with 34% in the same quarter of last year. And finally on drivers, you can see client deposit balances were up 15% year-on-year but down 2% quarter-on-quarter seasonally. Moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 9, this quarter, we saw net income of about $580 million on revenue of $1.7 billion with an ROE of 17%. Revenue was relatively flat year-over-year and declined by approximately $200 million sequentially. The sequential decline was about two-thirds NII, driven by a large recovery we reported in the prior quarter together with lower day count. The balance of the decline was lower NII on seasonally lower fees. A bright spot in the quarter was gross IB revenues of $450 million for the quarter, up over 30% year-on-year, a record for the first quarter and representing nearly 35% of North America IB fees. Our credit costs continue to show very strong performance with a net recovery rate of 4 basis points and expense was up 7% year-on-year, given the investments we have been making in the business as well as the impact of cost of control and compliance. Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Consistent with recent trends, real estate growth remains really strong at 15%. Both our Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking portfolios grew in the double digits, outpacing the industry. In C&I, loan growth remains tepid and the environment remains extremely competitive. There were pockets of growth including the expansion market, which were up 17% and increased activity in healthcare, oil and gas and technology sectors. With respect to pipelines, we saw the pipeline trends up or strengthen a little from the lows of last year, trending in the right direction but still relatively weak versus a year ago. Moving on to Page 10, Asset Management, the quarter saw net income of about $440 million, down 9% year-on-year, with an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 5% year-on-year, driven by flows and market performance, primarily Europe and the U.S., off of a very strong first quarter a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue was down 13% despite continued inflows, two thirds of the declines was driven by normal seasonality and performance fees. The remainder of the decline related to the change in the mark-to-market of the seed investments. We did mention a $100 million of both, positive mark-to-market reflected in the fourth quarter\u2019s results. We gave some of that back this quarter, driving the sequential variance impact to be over $150 million. This was the 20th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, $20 billion for the quarter, driving record AUM of $1.6 trillion, up 11% year-on-year and we\u2019ve seen a strong start to April. Expense increased 11% year-on-year, given higher investments and cost of controls and decreased 8% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower comp on the revenue. Lastly in banking, we continue to see strong loan and deposit growth with record balances up 19% and 7% respectively. Moving on to Page 11 on Corporate and Private Equity, private equity net income of over $200 million included approximately $400 million of gains on investments in the quarter. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million. NII remains relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, had a negative $90 million and we continue to expect NII in Treasury and CIO to breakeven by the year end, driven by higher securities yields as we benefit through higher rates. Additionally, we deployed $25 billion growth of new investments in the quarter, with the portfolio being relatively flat, less of maturities, pay downs and sales. And before I continue, let me just tell you about NIM and NII for a second. The page is in the appendix. Total NIM was flat quarter-on-quarter and Core NIM was up 2 basis points, primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, offset by loan spread compressions. Finally, on this page, other corporate net income of a little over $200 million plus. Included in these results is a $90 million after-tax impact of writing down our deferred tax asset following changes to New York State tax, which was enacted at quarter end. This upfront impact of DVA would be offset over time. And as I said earlier, no significant legal expense to report for the quarter. It obviously is good to have a quarter with such a small number and perhaps puts such large issues behind us. However, I want to remind you that we still expect legal expenses to be lumpy quarter-over-quarter for the next couple of years as we work through remaining issues. Now on Page 12, we\u2019ve covered most of the outlook as we went through the presentation. Just a couple of additional things to cover, first, mortgage production. We told you to expect mortgage production to be negative for the year, we do and we expect it to be negative for the second quarter. Obviously, the final result would be market dependent. However, at this point, our outlook as per production pre-tax, excluding repurchase to be a loss of between $100 million and $150 million, slightly improved from the first quarter on higher volume seasonally. Second on releases, expect mortgage reserve releases to be more modest going forward except for potentially PCI, purchase credit-impaired loans where we could see some lumpy releases, if we would have any, and expect card releases to be essentially over. So to wrap up, we feel good about the simplicity of the quarter and solid core performance given challenging industry conditions. We are also pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on key items, including announcing the sale of our physical commodities business and our retirement planning services business, passing C-corp qualitatively and quantitatively, exceeding 5% for the firm and bank leverage ratios, and maintaining strong expense discipline while investing in growth and control, and perhaps most importantly, continuing to deliver outstanding customer service and continuing to grow underlying performance drivers. With that, operator, you can open up the line please for Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Hello there. Marianne Lake : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Hello. Maybe with avoiding too much of the detail, say at the high level, and talk about no loan growth on a year-on-year basis and now there is a bunch of mix in there. And I guess I am particularly interested in the C&I bucket because that\u2019s the one area where we do see some growth in the industry. So, A, there is a little bit of verbiage in your text on how you define C&I loan growth in the corporate bucket. And, B, are there areas where you just think pricing is getting a little high and you\u2019re purposely avoiding that growth? Marianne Lake : So Glenn, if you just -- so that I can give you the underlying core growth number for the firm. So the quarter was 4% year-on-year, even though obviously as you take into consideration the runoff portfolios and mortgage and cards, we were closer to flat. In C&I, you\u2019re right, the industry was up slightly, we were not. It\u2019s a continuation of the things we talked about which is a combination of current selection of being very disciplined on credit, so not chasing growth at the cost of liberal credit structures and overly aggressive pricing, and also the fact that we continue to see some of our criticized and classified loans be refinanced away from us. So, we are just going to hold the line on discipline. We are seeing the ongoing aggressive investing environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we will do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we are not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline. Glenn Schorr - ISI: I appreciate that. And obviously over time we will see that in both a steadier to up NIM and good delinquency trends I guess. Marianne Lake : Yes. So a higher quality portfolio, higher quality trends. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. On the SLR that just came out, you gave us the expected impact, so I appreciate that. In Jamie\u2019s annual letter, I think you said 'we began to make significant changes to the rates business and expect to maintain decent profitability'. Could you talk about what you\u2019ve done in rates? How much through that -- through those changes we\u2019ve seen and what to expect on the other side? Jamie Dimon : I think very broadly if you look at the numbers, yes, we pushed down our capital leverage SLR to all the businesses that are all making adjustments as appropriate. In the rates business in particular, we\u2019ve seen there is very few what I call exotic rates products being done anymore, so it would be a rather large change. A lot of things going electronic which can reduce your expenses too, so we are pretty comfortable what rate business will be -- will be normal profitability going forward. It may take a little bit of time. Marianne Lake : And Glenn I just want to make sure that it was clear in my remarks that the impact of the new proposal to leverage is included in the reported results. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Very clear. And normal profitability might mean lower revenues but normal profitability right as things change in that business? Jamie Dimon : A little bit, yeah. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to spreads going forward, so we are comfortable we want to stay in the business. We do a good job at it with our clients. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. Last one, Marianne, I guess next on the hit parade is final rules on LCR and OLA, do you feel that\u2019s coming this year and do you expect -- how do you feel you are positioned for that? Marianne Lake : So with LCR and whether you take the Basel or the U.S. proposals, we are compliant at this point with the margin and importantly we will stick with our own internal framework. So we feel good about LCR, we are continuing to manage it as you would expect. Yes, I am expecting us to get long-term debt rules this year, but I don\u2019t know when and I can\u2019t control it. We feel with over 19% available resources that we\u2019re in a good starting position and so we\u2019re not really going to be in a business of guessing where that ends up, will just accordingly if it\u2019s different from our expectations. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. Thank you, both. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Thank you for walking us through the progress on the leverage ratio. I am just wondering should we expect on the bank level that you would be complying to 6% at some point this year or was the quarterly progress at this quarter or last quarter rather unusual? Marianne Lake : So given that we did some restructuring of bank level capital, including downstreaming, that was a fairly sizeable increase in the quarter, so you are not going to see progress be linear, but there are a number of different levers that we have in our toolkit so to speak to get to 6% over time. Whether that this year or whether that into next year we are going to be measured about the progress. So whether that\u2019s retaining earnings, potentially additional capital, we\u2019ve been auctioning leverage actions both deposits as well as derivatives actions. And then ultimately there is also the good guy when it comes, timing dependent upon maybe a 2015 thing hopefully moving from same to the newly named FACCR calculations, the derivatives central future exposure. We did take a look at the information on FACCR and it hasn\u2019t changed our point of view that we would expect that to have a favorable impact for the bank of 40 basis points plus or minus. So when that comes that will be a nice boost not through retaining earnings and the leverage actions we have and potentially more capital optimizations. We have clear path of 6% whether it\u2019s this year earnings, 2015. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Okay. And the second question, given that you are already compliant in the LCR, is it fair for us to assume that your core margin should continue to improve throughout the year at this measured pace? Marianne Lake : Yes. I would say it\u2019s fair to assume our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the year and I think plus or minus 2 basis points on a -- not balance sheet like us, we would make changes, it\u2019s relatively stable. So our expectation is the core NIM to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015 assuming that the implied rate cut stays out the way it is. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Okay. And just last one for me in terms of your comments on card provision, help us think about sort of the balance in terms of the catalyst for your guidance? Should we start to expect balance growth to come back or is this more of a comment that charge-offs are as well as they will go and should normalize here? Marianne Lake : So it\u2019s a combination of factors, we are seeing delinquency trends and rate charge-offs flatten out. We knew that it would happen one day. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing at the moment. We will continue to what they do through the course of the year. Based up on that, we are not expecting anymore results. In addition, you should know that we thought our outstandings were flat and underneath that our core portfolio is growing. We still do believe we are at our inflection point and that we should see some growth, but it will be relatively modest. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you, Erika. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : If you look at the traditional bank fees, even outside of mortgage that recur year-over-year than I think most might have been expecting and looking like the card fees, service charges. Do you think that\u2019s all weather related or just weaker macro back drop than maybe we were looking for? Marianne Lake : So is it about interchange fees in cards? Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Just the overall credit card fee line that you give us and obviously will include the interchange but probably one of the things as well? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So the sales volume obviously seasonally goes down quarter-over-quarter. I don\u2019t think that we have perceived there\u2019s been a significant impact from weather on card sales in the first quarter. For us, our sales were up 10% year-over-year, so pretty strong. No, I wouldn\u2019t attribute anything to the weather. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just separately the expense guidance for this year, I think is unchanged, even though revenues coming a little bit weaker than expected. I realize this is just the first quarter and things could change but is there opportunity to adjust the expense base a bit more if revenues light? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So you saw -- I mean, obviously you saw in the first quarter on the back of lower revenues in the markets business. We have lower compensation as an absolute matter that the ratio is relatively in line. So you\u2019re absolutely right depending upon, excuse me -- how the rest of the year pans out will determine whether the compensation expenses inherit in our outlook for CIB are up or down or flat and that will adjust our ending results. And we\u2019re not ready yet to declare a position on the whole year, so less than $59 billion is still our guidance but we intend to be very, very decedent. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : All right. And then just lastly on the buybacks and net of issuance being approved for greater than $5 billions. Any comments just on the timing or up likelihood of all that being used this year? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So, on the timing, I mentioned the fact that we aren\u2019t expecting a capital accretion to 10% plus to be linear. We\u2019re expecting it to be much more in the second half of the year, flatter in the first half. So it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we will be covering employee issuance plus or minus in the first half of the year with most of our repurchase capacity being available for us in the second half. As to how much of that we will use, it will be a number of factors including obviously our share price at the time. But we do intend to take advantage of the opportunity that we\u2019ve being given to buyback and we\u2019ll see what the absolute level is when we get there. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi Marianne. In the mortgage area, the $400 million hit to that, just to qualify that, that was a one-time hit related to your top corporate reallocation of cap related earlier this year? Marianne Lake : Yeah. That sounds really wise. So when we declared Investor Day that we\u2019d increase target rate, so that business we pushed that down into the valuation of the asset one time. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And again the reasons for the negative profit margin we\u2019re seeing on the origination side. Is it just the timing of getting expenses adjusted to a new base originations. And it takes that there is a lag or is there also some investment expenses that you\u2019re running through that that they\u2019re also hurting your mortgage profitability? Marianne Lake : Three things, there is a little bit of timing in there and so far as we did make continued improvement in expenses and we\u2019re going to continue to work on what we would characterize as that is sort of fixed cost base. It\u2019s definitely the case that we are building this business for the long run and so we continue to invest in technology and operations that may cause more profitable and efficient through the cycle. But it is also the case that is an incredibly small market. I mean, the market size was sub $250 billion, so annualized sub a trillion dollars, which is not something we\u2019ve seen in since before 2000. So the reality is in the market of that size, is very hard to have strong profitability or possibility when you have to have a core level of fixed expenses. And so we\u2019re thinking about this business over the longer run to be as efficient and profitable as possible through the cycle in markets that are on average bigger than this. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And then on the markets activity in the investment bank, I guess a bit disappointed that activity level didn\u2019t pick up in March, though it seem like overall rate volatility picked up as people took different takes in the fed statements. Do you attribute some of the weakness to the lower issuance compared to last year, what seems likes that continue and what do you think is needed to stimulate better activity, particularly in fact this year? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would say lower issuance was a factor with our M&A. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it was a single driving factor, lower on mortgage issuance, lowest debt issuance. There was a whole bunch of different things. And then as to catalyst, more volatility, more growth and we just wait and see. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And do you have any sense of what kind of you\u2019re planning for there or is it really just a wait-and-see on the environmental faults and you react as it occurs? Jamie Dimon : I think John, we always have been very consistent on this kind of thing. You guys kind of make your own estimates because they are just as good as ours. Great business with great people, technology, sales, research but we can\u2019t predict it going forward. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Marianne Lake : Similar to the mortgage comment, where it\u2019s a long-term view, it will affect the business and this is one quarter so. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Got it. Any impacts on the commodity sale that\u2019s planned or did you move that to discontinued ops or did that have any impact on the market, the metric this quarter, Marianne? Marianne Lake : Yes. We\u2019ve accounted for held-for-sale and no significant impacts to the results. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hey good morning. Couple of follow-ups, one on commodities business that you are in the process selling, can you give us the sense as to what the impact is likely to be per sale? Marianne Lake : So we\u2019ve reflected any of -- obviously we looked at the bid and valuation in any of the difference versus booked in our P&L and is insignificant. And we are engaged in ongoing relationship with the buyer and we\u2019ll realize P&L over time but does not expect to see anything significant. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just a couple of clarifications, on OLA, you mentioned 19% available resources, I assume that\u2019s against RWA, but I just wanted to clarify? Marianne Lake : Yeah. Correct. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then on SLR, on Page 3, you showed the ratios, I just wanted to confirm the Basel III line says that it\u2019s on the fully phased-in bases but we don\u2019t see fully phased-in SLR, does that imply as transitional? Marianne Lake : No, its fully phased-in, that\u2019s a fully phased-in, Betsy. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : On the SLR as well, right? Marianne Lake : Yeah. But remember that that was the exception of the fact that we are baking in things that are not yet certain. So we haven\u2019t baked in the benefit that we would expect, for example, from SACCR because it hasn\u2019t yet been acknowledged? Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. In that 40 basis point benefit there is for the bank level and holdco level? Marianne Lake : The sensitivity is different in the bank and the holding company. So its more like 30 plus or minus at the holding companies, 40 plus or minus at the bank. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Great. And then lastly on expenses, you highlighted throughout all the areas, we had the headcount reduction. Can you just give us a sense as to whether or not the benefit to the expense dollars is fully in the first quarter or was there a negative things like severance that than the benefit to the expense dollars comes in Q2 and beyond? Marianne Lake : So with respect to the headcount reduction in the first quarter, the severance wasn\u2019t significant and benefit is largely in. Remember we said that overall the firm is expecting that the headcount goes down by about 5000 for the full year and it\u2019s down only by 2000. So possibly we have another way to go. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : In the pace of that 3000 from here is ratable or front end loaded? Marianne Lake : So if you think about it gross, mortgage was 6000 of that total gross and its 3000, and so another 3000 ago. I would say in the nearer or longer term. And in the consumer bank that was 2000 with 1500 and remainder will just happen three times. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Good morning. Marianne Lake : Hi. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Hi. Just wanted to follow-up on the FACCR, thanks for the guidance on the potential benefit? Can you give us a sense of what specifically is driving that to be beneficial? I have gone through the BIS release, but frankly, without understanding what the underlying is, it\u2019s really difficult to understand why it\u2019s a benefit, just maybe you can help us qualitatively understand that? Marianne Lake : Yeah. I will give you sort of very short quantitative answer and then if you want to really go dig in, I\u2019ll do offline with the Investor Relations, but a very short answer is, as an additional ability to recognize collateral and netting that wasn\u2019t in the original fee and calculations, but lots and lots of other complexity to it. We are doing our best estimate though we haven\u2019t fully built the models to do it, so we are continuing to work on that but if you want to get into very technical discussion on it we can arrange that for you. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. I\u2019ll probably follow up but that's helpful. Thanks. You mentioned a number of times as you went through and we could see it in the slides that a lot of the expense impacts to the -- that expenses were problematic relative to year ago, a lot of that was because of the control agenda, which obviously, we appreciated, you spoken to? But can we step back and talk about in a holistic firm-wide way where are we with implementing that, how much more impact do we expect to see, at what point do we kind of lap on that? Marianne Lake : Okay. So a couple of things, first is that, if you remember from Investor Day, notwithstanding that, earlier comment about the volatility potentially in compensation in the market businesses. We said we would be below $59 billion and there were four principal I think driving that. So in our favor, we had efficiencies, in bunch of the efficiencies in CIB and mainly mortgage down about a $1.5 billion year-over-year and against that we had the billion dollars incremental cost of control and some gross principally in asset management. So the net of all of those meant that we were effectively self-funding through efficiency and reduce mortgage expenses, the incremental cost and control we are seeing come true. It is in the case that we have broken out as a macro matter, how much of that $1 billion is on our run-rate now and maybe we\u2019ll do that for you next quarter. I would say that, we are adding heads and so these things do take some time even though I believe that there will be a chunk in our run-rate through the middle of the year if not all in our run-rate yet. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: That's it. So if I can interpret that that's means after the year we should have a sort fully lapped is that what you are saying? Marianne Lake : I\u2019ll ask to confirm to you in the next quarter, but I would say that we have a majority of it through the mid-year because we are, obviously, trying to hire up to be able to execute on the agenda. So if you think about the impact with, trying to add people to compliance, we are adding people to compliance, to legal, to audit, to finance, to risk and we are doing that largely in the first half of the year but that will be a time. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. That's also really helpful. In terms of effect and the weakness that we saw? Can you comment at all and if it\u2019s possible you can quantify a little bit what the impact was of some of the adoptions of SEF mandates during the quarter, we could certainly see that SEF volumes themselves seem to get disrupted at certain point in the quarter when new mandates went into play, but just if you think about the impact of that regulatory change on the OTC derivatives markets, it would be really helpful to understand, how much of the impact with just regulatory change? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So, I mean, it\u2019s -- as you know it\u2019s very, very difficult to decouple everything, but and so it\u2019s not clear that there is no impact but it\u2019s not our sense that it was a significant driver of the performance in the quarter and there is a limited amount of volume on SEF right now albeit increasing and there has been margin compression but from tight margins start with, so it\u2019s not our sense that it was a significant driver enough to say that there was no impact. Jamie Dimon : So it did come down a little bit, there is kind of back to where it was, due to trading and we wouldn\u2019t blame that for that anything. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: So if one were to think that there was -- there were going to be spread compression over time as a result of some of these things that might still lie in the future next to your $1 billion plus or minus revenue impact that you\u2019ve talked about? Marianne Lake : That's right. So, I mean, again not to say that there hasn\u2019t been any but the volume is relatively low, they are being relatively tight, the $1 billion we talked about which is by the way our best estimate, so it could be better than that is something that we are progressed through times it is not going to be a cliff. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Great. That's all. Very helpful. I appreciate you are taking my questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys share with us on your loan loss provision this quarter, obviously last year the provision was greatly affected by the loan loss reserve releases, should we anticipate the provision reaching your net charge-off levels this year to match them out? Marianne Lake : So the best guidance there I can give you is the guidance that we gave at Investor Day which is expect the firm-wide charge-off to be at around $5 billion plus or minus and then I would point you to the guidance we just gave you on reserve releases which is expect some really mortgage but not it, expect we might have some PTI but it\u2019s too early to know and little more in cost, so net those two down. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. And just speaking... Marianne Lake : And there maybe some noise to that but that's our current outlook. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. Speaking the TCI loans, year-over-year about 10% to 12%, should we expect that type of run-rate throughout the year, is that portfolio continues to shrink? Marianne Lake : Yes. Largely speaking. In fact you are talking right 10% but yes. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. You talked about in the mortgage business, you are changing the way you are approaching it and the revenue run-rate you had this quarter of about $160 million? Can you size for us where you think under the new approach that you are having with mortgages what kind of revenues we might anticipate because I am assuming this was unusually low at this quarter\u2019s number? Marianne Lake : So our production revenues this quarter and just to make sure, we are talking about the same thing was just about $300 million. I told you that we are expecting second quarter to be negative. You are going to have higher revenues because seasonally you have higher volumes, but obviously its market depends. So I would say given seasonality, the first quarter was small and volumes were depressed given the whether we will be hopeful that the market would be above the $1 trillion for the full year, maybe not as high as $1.2 trillion, so if you add seasonality back in and gross up the number you probably get quite close. But, of course, it could all change depending upon rates in the market. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Great. And then finally... Marianne Lake : I mean the current outlook for the market size, it was about $1.2 trillion, I suspect that will be revised down slightly on the back of the first quarter. So we are going to have a small market and it\u2019s going to be actually linear. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. In the institutional asset management business, you pointed out that it declined sequentially in the revenues because of the some of the one-time items in the fourth quarter? The year-over-year declines, even on the inflows were up, any comments on the revenues from the institutional revenue part of that business? Marianne Lake : Year-over-year revenues for asset management and institutional, no specific, we have some -- March was not strong, the first quarter so institutional was not as strong as the other segments, so no specific issues but there is some lumpiness there obviously. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. And then finally, may just be a market conditions or maybe some you can do, when you look at your net interest margin and you look at the interest earning asset yields, the securities borrowed number was a negative 30 basis points and trending more negative each quarter, it was minus 2 basis points a year ago? Can we -- can you point to anything you could do to try to reverse that? Marianne Lake : Yeah. The securities, that line listen is a some funky features also fact that in our prime services business when we -- our contractual income is LIBOR minus the spreads which drives that to be a negative number. I wouldn\u2019t lead too much into the trend and volatility there, the absolute economics of the business is still positive and the offset is in trading liability, so that\u2019s not a line item in its own right and alone that is very conservative. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek De Vries of UBS. Derek De Vries - UBS: Thanks. I had a few question, you had no significant items that you called to our attention but then you said there are few sort of non-core items and that broadly offset? And just, as I am looking on my notes, I see there is like a $400 million negative in MSR, this is $90 million in tax, there is $200 million of DBA, FBA, all negative? And there is like $400 million of private equity gains? I guess I am missing another sort of $300 million of positive, I was just wondering if you can kind of call out what that would be? Marianne Lake : Reserve releases. Jamie Dimon : Reserve, yeah. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. The reserve releases, yeah. All right. Understood. Marianne Lake : And then we don\u2019t fill into every $50 million negative non-recurring item but there were some of them too. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. That\u2019s fine. And then, just, on the tax rate, I mean, obviously, I\u2019ll strip out the $90 million, but it still feels like a high tax rate? Is there anything sort of funny going on there? Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s not far off the 30% plus or minus, this is our generally expected effective tax rate. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. Marianne Lake : Nothing else of any noteworthiness, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s going to be impacted by the absolute level of pre-tax, the percentage of overseas income, the percentage of tax efficient income, but nothing special. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. And then the guidance on mortgage production it sort of pushed out the losses and we talked about a lot. But just so I am clear that the change in your guidance there is just essentially a change in your market expectations the $1.2 trillion coming to the lower number that\u2019s the only real change you\u2019ve got there. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay? Marianne Lake : I mean, we haven\u2019t really changed our guidance, to be fair, our guidance is almost to be negative for the year we are just trying to be very specific about the degree of negative in the second quarter to make sure you have inflation to your model. Derek De Vries - UBS: Perfect. And we appreciate that. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller - FBR: Yeah. Thank you very much. On the, I am sorry for that guys, on the, you guys mentioned, I believe in the report or in comments that you want to get your servicing portfolio down to from $800 billion to $600 billion on loans there, I guess, on just natural decay and selling MSRs? When do you think the timing of those sells of the MSRs and do you think that the -- a lot of people feel that you cannot transfer any MSRs anymore due to some of the headline risk? Can you add some color to that also? Marianne Lake : So, obviously, the timing of sales is going to be a little bit opportunistic, so the best comment I can make is that $600 million number is two, three years away from now, not necessarily but we will try and manage it the best way we can. And then with respect to the ability to settled sub-service, I mean, there is still the opportunity to do it. It is just not necessarily the case that you can defeat your risk entirely which I think is understood. Paul Miller - FBR: Could you add more color, I mean, you can\u2019t get any of the risk, can you add more color around that? Marianne Lake : Well, I mean, in so far, as I think that, as we move loan to sub-services, obviously, we retained the risk and have to have third-party advise to the degree we sell them, I think, regulators are potentially looking at originators to continue to there from the origination of other risk. Jamie Dimon : So and then we -- and we are going to run the MSR for returns and quality. So it\u2019s also question will we put into it to reach high expected to see less FHA and anything like that and then you see some run-off overtime? Paul Miller - FBR: And then, Jamie, on the credit boxes, not really extending, what do you think, what kind of impact you think there is happening on the overall mortgage market, especially the purchase market as we are seeing almost 14-year lows on origination side? Jamie Dimon : No. It\u2019s almost impossible to tell, but there are, if you are jumbo you get loan, if you are GSE you get loans, but almost all the other stuff in between, anything with any hereon it like you had a credit problem, if you are earning self-report income. So a lot of people have overlaid, it being tougher than it required the FHA, GSE or the own rules because the reps and warranties, et cetera, and I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to go away. It\u2019s not getting worse. It\u2019s just kind of sitting there and probably holding back a little bit the purchase market. Marianne Lake : And I think, you think about credit is available across the LTV spectrum but the bars to be able to document income and improve ability to repay and to amortize. Paul Miller - FBR: Okay. Hey guys thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Steven Chubak - Nomura: You had alluded to some of the drivers of RWA growth earlier and I was just hoping you had frame that in a context of your $40 billion targeted RWA decline from Investor Day and whether that\u2019s potentially a risk or is the $1.5 trillion RWA level is still achievable? Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s still understood that we were going to have certain of our models that need this additional work to be acceptable by the regulator of Basel III when we gave the guidance at Investor Day. So as a large matter as you say here today that\u2019s still our best understanding of how things will workout absent there being any news or issues during the year. Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s a timing difference as oppose we target difference. Marianne Lake : Yeah. I mean, the whole industry submitted a huge number of models under Basel 2.5 the regulators to review at the beginning of 2013 and we had an approval to use and for the year while they were being reviewed and pending after the review, we\u2019ve got some feedback and we are going to remediate the models and resubmit those approval, it will take us time but it is timing. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. I understood. And then, transitioning to OLA for a second, long-term debt outstanding did increase modestly about 2% in the quarter? I just wanted to confirm how we should be thinking about issuance plans over the course of the year, are you managing it to a 90% bail in buffer, so we saw the modest increase in RWA and saw commensurate increase in long-term debt or should we be thinking about entirely differently? Jamie Dimon : Entirely, just soon as can be take out too. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. Jamie Dimon : Then we know the real rules we made to modify that. Marianne Lake : Yeah. That\u2019s right. We are not managing to an OLA, we don\u2019t know yet. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. Fair enough. And then last one from me, the high-frequency trading review and market structure, potential market structure overall continues to be an area of increasing focus. And I was hoping you could speak to the equities business and whether the anticipated SEC review and potential broader equity market structure form will compel any adjustments and how you are thinking about that this juncture? Jamie Dimon : We are firmly supportive of having profit and good markets for everybody. And we think we have pretty good policies and protocols in place so. But I don\u2019t know what it will do to our issues in market structure with some pools, et cetera. We will just have to look at that review take place. I should point out in Michael Lewis' book which I did not read, on Page 231, they talk us as one of the good guys Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for taking my questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Harte of Sandler O'Neill Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: Hi. Good morning. A couple left for me. One, looking at Consumer Business Banking such as the deposits business, the overhead of the efficiency ratio there has really turned it up for a few years straight. I know there has been some investment as well. But how should we think of that going from kind of a 70 plus, that\u2019s been now back to some kind of a bit, kind of 60 like it historical was? Marianne Lake : From the sense, as you know, we have been investing and building our branch to the place it is know where we are happy with the distribution capability we have, because that was driving a lot of the investment. In 2014, we continue to invest in quarterly and the cost to serve an efficiency, so that we can driven the ratios down. We guided at Investor Day to expect expenses in the business to be up 1%, so a little but not kind of increase that we can say lot of which you should expect to start to come down and we said that the overall CCB fees including mortgage would be down $3 billion by 2015 over 2014 and the chunk of that is in CBB. So we\u2019re very focused on it and investing in fact in the technology and processes to be able to be efficient. We\u2019ve started to see the increased term as we stopped having to invest in branches because we are happy with the distribution and it will start to come down next year. Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: So that\u2019s getting better. To some extent, this expense is going down, to what extent is the revenue is getting better? Do you mean it is the WaMu footprint factor into that or we\u2019re kind of waiting for interest rate up? Marianne Lake : So everything that I spoke about in terms of the expenses going down is dollar on a dollar basis and not an efficiency ratio basis. So we\u2019re absolutely expecting dollars to come down after 2014 in the business. With respect to the new branches, I mean, we said that a third of our branches are less than 10 years and about 11% less than three years. Also we had a lot of branches in the deposit gathering base and deposit margins are relatively flat. So at the moment we reached the point where the volume is out is providing support to NII but not strong growth until we start to see rate continue to rise and be able to reinvest up the curve as deposit investments mature. Jamie Dimon : The underlying numbers are terrific, customer satisfaction, deposits, households, mobile, Chase Wealth Management, small business et cetera but they are being squeezed by NII interest rates. And we\u2019ve always told you we are going to go for the one run which is that we will cover one day and you will see spreads grow up in this business and we are not happy if that happens. We are not going to -- not grow deposits because of that. And that will also affect obviously efficiency ratio. Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: Okay. And on the litigation side, nice to have a quarter where there aren\u2019t big charges, who knows what the market does but in theory that\u2019s a good thing for the share price. Is there a potential for that to be a good thing for the underlying businesses too? I mean, if all the headline risk been negative on some of the business lines from a consumer -- customer perspective? Marianne Lake : Yes. So as much as I would love to be able to take a quarter, that looks like this and say we could expect more of the same. The reality is we still have issues open in front of us. We still have large reserve and we still are working through them. So we\u2019ve been cleared of what we can\u2019t predict. Legal expenses, we do expect them to be lumpy and for every zero or close to zero a quarter we could have a quarter that has several hundred million dollars or more albeit that it should trend down on a basis something much lower at the time. So I don\u2019t think you can read into it. That we\u2019ve done with working through issues which we obviously glad to have some of them behind us and some of them bigger and most difficult ones. Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: To the extent, you are not working hopefully a multibillion dollar quarterly settlements any more, I mean does that help on the volume side of the businesses. Did that have a negative impact on kind of customer interactions with you? Jamie Dimon : If you look at the customer flows, in every single business, they are very good and customers stats scores are up, investments are up, assets under management are up. Our market shares are up in credit card, consumer, deposits, that sounds very good. So I would completely separate out this litigation stuff. And Marianne, you all have averaged your own estimate for litigation I think are $500 million a quarter. Marianne Lake : On average, close to about 500, yes. Jamie Dimon : Make believe I\u2019m going to use your number, nobody else\u2019s. It\u2019s not going to be 500, consistent, it is going to be zero, something else, zero to 50, that\u2019s what it is until it goes away. It\u2019s not going to affect the underlying business. And as you know, we also have one-time benefits from stuff we don\u2019t anticipate to. Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: So you haven\u2019t noticed kind of a negative reputational impact of customers. It\u2019s been okay obviously. Looking at the values, I guess, it must be okay? Marianne Lake : We\u2019re growing share, so I mean\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Clients go with their feet and they seem to be coming to our branches and our bankers. Jeff Harte - Sandler O'Neill: Okay. Thank you. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Yes. Hey, good morning. Two follow-ups, first on the expense side. I think if you look at the run rate this quarter, you were at around $58.4 billion, so well below, if you analyze that than your $59 billion target. And seasonally this would be the higher expense quarter given capital markets revenue. Is there something we should be thinking about in the out quarters whether it\u2019s higher regulatory compliance spending, marketing spending or is this just some conservative because we don\u2019t where capital markets revenues go? Marianne Lake : So it\u2019s a little bit -- we don\u2019t where half the market\u2019s revenues will go obviously and if they stay low or we expect to pass that down to the bottom line. It\u2019s also a little bit of there are some times positive and some times negative surprises and issues in expenses and this time, it would be another quarter. So there is a little bit of cautiousness in that. We are going to obviously do everything we can to outperform that. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a quick question back on the SLR. You guys I think last quarter, I think before the changes by Basel, noted that the Basel Committees\u2019 calculation would be a net drag of 10 basis points. This quarter, it\u2019s 15 to 20 basis points benefit rate. Is that simply the change in the credit conversion factors on the op balance sheet, credit lines or is there anything else driving that improvement this quarter? Marianne Lake : So most of the improvement in this quarter was associated with the ability for us to net variation margin on derivatives across currencies as allowed by contracts rather than having to only net in the currency of the underlying transaction, so that was obviously sensible that you should be allowed from a margin across allowable currencies but that was not the provision of the Basel Committees\u2019. The U.S. proposal changed that and that\u2019s favorable, that\u2019s driving most of it. There are other things up-down, competitive, technical things but not big numbers. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay. And that doesn\u2019t include the benefit of moving to, say the non-internal model methodology which could be another 40 basis points? Marianne Lake : That\u2019s correct, but that\u2019s -- I'm not expecting that in the very near future. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Right. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Yes. Good morning. As you mentioned, I\u2019m looking at Page 17 of your supplement on the credit card business. And as you mentioned, like all the volume metrics, all look great, sales volume up 10% and merchant processing up 11%. But then when you look at the fees, it\u2019s down 4% and I would have thought we\u2019ve kind of anniversaried all the regulatory changes and so on. So, I guess the big question for me is on this business in particular, why aren\u2019t the favorable volume metrics translating into revenues? Jamie Dimon : We will have to get back to you. Marianne Lake : We will get back to you. I apologize. But we will get back to you. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Okay. Jamie Dimon : Probably as soon, but we will get back to you. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then just secondly on a broader philosophical level, Jamie, a couple of years ago at Investor Day, you rhetorically asked the question about capital markets income. Is it cyclical or is it secular? And you said believe me, it\u2019s cyclical and now, you look industry wide by my numbers, we are down on a year-over-year basis, 13 out of the last 17 quarters and it\u2019s sure as heck feeling secular. And I\u2019m curious , one, have you adjusted your point of view? Two, do you think there is some irreducible level of transaction volume business for the industry? And three, how do we gauge how far we are on that glide path from where we used to be to where we have stabilized? Jamie Dimon : So there are certain things which were secular. People gotten out of -- I'm not talking about as per se, but people gotten out of or reduced dramatically credit hybrids, certain exotic derivatives, et cetera. I think there maybe additional secular change but it\u2019s not the whole business. So the way I look at the whole business is we have a 120 trading desks around the world, we have 16,000 clients. And if you look at the fuel of the business, the fuel of the business is investable assets in need of people to invest those, whether it is corporations, individual, et cetera, those numbers will double over 10 years. They are going to triple in the emerging and developing markets and spreads themselves have been coming down fairly consistently for 20 years and that\u2019s called capitalism that you are officially using capital. And so I look at as a long-term business. It will be a good business. Shares are going to change. There will be a whole bunch of adjustments. As you know, it can change at a dime. And so I don\u2019t look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup, I think it\u2019s pretty good business. And we\u2019ve been very consistent in performance. The number is driven by technology, research, scales, ideas, of course, order flows and last year, we didn't even have one trading day loss, which I consider truly spectacular. So it\u2019s a good business, it will grow over time and it will have some secular adjustment. So, I don\u2019t know why your number being right, the 13 or 17 quarters. And I also wouldn\u2019t go back and look at the peak, the really peak markets of \u201807 or something and I think you had something at \u201809 and so that was a standard. I think that was a little higher than normal. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Well, my numbers were -- industry from \u201809 on or \u201810 on so but anyway, but thanks. Maybe, it\u2019s probably an unanswerable question. That\u2019s it. Marianne Lake : I have an answer to your other question, I apologize for not having it off of my head. In the first quarter of last year in non-interest revenue and costs, we had a one-time exit over non-core products. So, I think if you go back and dig out that transcript or have a look at the supplement there that was actually a one-time item. So if we adjust for that, we would have been up most only. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Okay. All right. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : I want to mention on the credit card business, we have beta tests going of our Chase net and you are not going to see the numbers this year, but we think it\u2019s a pretty exciting thing that we can do for merchants and customers over time. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thanks for joining us. Jamie Dimon : All right. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Jamie Dimon : Yes, so this is Jamie and I\u2019m going to start if you don\u2019t mind. I know some of you may have questions about my recent cancer diagnosis. So I\u2019d like to make a few comments on that, so we can then hopefully focus on the reason for our call which is our quarterly earnings and the results of the company. First I want to thank everybody for their calls, their notes, their good wishes, it does mean a lot to me and my family. To start with I feel great. I think I\u2019ve some of the best doctors in the world. I\u2019ll be receiving the best treatment. I\u2019m very fortunate that this is curable.  To recap we\u2019ve already talked about and what my doctor\u2019s told me about, we caught it early. It\u2019s confined to the original site and the adjacent lymph node in the right side of my neck. It\u2019s isolated in that specific area. The cancer has not spread. Importantly with all the tests they have done there is no evidence of cancer anywhere else in my body and it\u2019s curable with radiation and chemotherapy which I\u2019ll put down as fairly standard for this kind of cancer and the prognosis is excellent.  The Board will be fully briefed on my condition and if they and I feel that it\u2019s necessary to make additional disclosures we will do that, but I really do think the next disclosure I\u2019m going to make will in be about seven or eight weeks saying the therapy is over. I am feeling better and the prognosis is excellent. My doctors have finalized their treatment plans with me over the last several days though I do plan as we go through the treatment to be actively involved in managing our business. I\u2019ve also been told that after the seven week treatment period I\u2019ve been advised to take rest. That does not mean I won\u2019t work. They just simply say to rest and recuperation should come before other things, which by the way is the exact same advise I give my friends, my family and any one from JPMorgan or anyone of you who came down to something like this. So I do plan to work, I do plan to read, I will be accessible.  Succession planning that\u2019s why it\u2019s here, is exactly as it was before. There is no change whatsoever. The Board has plans in place and I talk about all the time from various scenarios and we are fortunate enough to have an exceptional group of executives. You know them all, I hope you take the time to tell some of the reports, their quality, I always tell there is a book in everybody and the book on the larger management team here is brains, ethics, work ethic, partnering, knowledge, experience, high quality people and I actually think that many of them can run a major financial company and my Board feels in the same way. And importantly the Board has been fully engaged with the senior leaders the whole time they have been at this company. I also want to point out. We have a standing protocol in place before this, during this, and after this. We think it\u2019s simply good governance that if I am unreachable for any reason, remember I took a three week trip to Asia so, it\u2019s for a minute, an hour, a day or a week that they are to contact our lead director, who will get them the consent the advice and the help that they need so the company continues to go on as usual.  So I will stop there and hand it off to Marianne, who will take you through the earnings of the company. Marianne Lake : Okay, thanks Jamie. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting now on page one. The firm delivered strong performance this quarter with net income of $6 billion on revenue of over $25 billion, EPS of a $1.46 and a return on tangible common equity of over 14%. The reported results as you can see on the page, include approximately $670 million of firm-wide legal expenses. In addition to that item there were a number of other smaller items, some positive, some negative in the result; most notably $350 million of consumer reserve releases. And we estimate our core performance for the quarter was also $6 billion plus or minus which is among the best we have ever had, which is a very good result especially given the challenging environment the market and mortgage which persisted during the second quarter and interest rates remaining low and the cost of control high. Importantly in the firm\u2019s performance this quarter we are really seeing the benefit of our diversified earnings profile as well as the focus on investing and growing the underlying performance drivers in each of our businesses. They have translated into net income, growth and operating leverage in a number of businesses most notably CBB, Commercial Banking and Asset Management.  We also continue to make significant progress against our capital target with a CET 1 ratio of 9.8% firm wide and bank supplementary leverage ratios of 5.4% and 5.6% respectively and remaining compliant with liquidity requirements, all while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholder this quarter with both share repurchases of $1.5 billion. Core loan growth was strong for the quarter at 4% and 8% up year-on-year with encouraging signs across our businesses and NII was up slightly this quarter on a relatively flat core NIM. Turning to page two, before getting into each of businesses, a couple of comments here. You can see circled the adjusted expense for the quarter was $14.8 billion for an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%. This number does obviously exclude legal expenses but of note it includes a little less than $300 million of expenses related to business simplification which we consider to be non-core, including lower incentive compensation on lower CIB revenues for the first half, we have updated our adjusted full expense guidance to be $58 billion plus or minus, with a caveat that obviously the final number will depend on the performance related compensation for the full year. We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses and operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses. You can also see on the page the returns generated this quarter by each of our businesses which is driving the strong performance of the firm overall.  Moving on to page three, as I said the firm reported a CET 1 ratio of 9.8%, up from 9.6% last quarter as we increased our common equity Tier I capital base by over $4 billion principally through net retained earnings. Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat in the quarter with higher operating risk RWA and some growth largely offset by lower market and credit risk RWA reflecting increased model usage and portfolio runoff. We're are still on track to reach 10% plus CET 1 ratio by the end of the year as previously guided.  The lower of our two transitional measures, and you will recall we exited Basel III parallel at the beginning of the quarter, so the lower of our two transitional measures which is technically the measure effected this quarter under the common floor is the Basel III advanced transitional ratio which is also at 9.8%. And what is on the page with full year information, the fully phased in standardized ratio is 10.1%.  We continue to make good progress on our leverage ratio this quarter, both the firm and the bank SLR increased quarter-over-quarter by about 30 basis points. So we're obviously within sight of our 5.5% target for the firm and a 5.6% for the bank we do have a clear path to our 6% plus target. Finally on this page we continue to have a very strong liquidity position remaining compliant with LCR.  Now moving on to the businesses starting on page four, Consumer and Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter and $11.4 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. We continue to see excellent growth in the underlying business drivers with average deposit up 9% in CBB, our active mobile customers up 23%, credit card sales volume up 12%, client investment assets up 19% and crossing the $200 billion and according to J D Power we continue to be ranked number one in overall customer satisfaction as-well-as the mortgage originations among large banks, And number one in three of four regions with more business banking customer satisfaction. Finally across CCB we expect to exceed our headcount reductions outlined at Investor Day.  Turning to page five, Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $894 million, up a significant 28% year-on-year on net revenue of $4.6 billion with an ROE of 33%. While we do continue to see some pressure on deposit margins this continues to be more than offset by strong growth in deposit balances, the 9% I just mentioned among the highest in the industry. This deposit growth is driven by strong household growth and record customer retention. We added 800,000 net households since last year as our new branches continue to mature.  On the non-interest revenue side we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and investment revenues as we deepen relationships with customers and as we see our global wealth management strategy play out with more affluent customers. In business banking the momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued. We have record originations up 46% year-on-year and 27% over last quarter back to levels that we last saw in 2012. We believe that this reflects a combination of improving industry trends driven by business optimism generally continuing to trend higher and improving banker performance especially in our expansion market where we've been investing and as our positive strategies mature.  Our pipeline continued to strengthen, 2Q'14 was the highest level since 2012 and we do expect this positive momentum and strong growth year-over-year to continue in the second half of the year. Expenses flat year-on-year with efficiency gains in the branches being offset by higher cost of controls that we've spoken about but it was down quarter-over-quarter as cost of investments and controls are moderating.  Turning to page six and Mortgage Banking, overall mortgage banking net income was $700 million for the quarter with an ROE of 16%. As expected the production environment remained challenging and mortgage production pretax income excluding repurchase was a negative $74 million for the quarter a little better than our guidance reflecting higher revenue margin on a mix shift towards retail loans and higher pipeline as well as good progress made in the quarter to reduce our fixed expenses. At this point, market dependent we expect the third quarter results to be broadly similar to the second quarter as more negative.  Originations of $17 billion were flat quarter-on-quarter and down 66% year-on-year which is in a market that we estimate was seasonally up 25% quarter-on-quarter which shows that we continue to lose some share. Key drivers behind the share loss were the continuation of our strategy to reduce our participation in lower FICO and high LTD government loans as well as the burn out of HART.  In addition we did lose some share in other conventional resulting from price competition as we maintained discipline regarding pricing to required returns. Mortgage production benefited in the quarter from a repurchase reserve release of positive $137 million driven primarily by refinement in expectations regarding certain residual risks following the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2013.  On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of $693 million is down slightly quarter-on-quarter but is higher than guidance due primarily to higher gains on acquired securities and Ginnie Mae loan sales, while we do expect to continue to benefit from both during the second half of the year to a lesser extent than the first and these gains can be lumpy. So we expect servicing revenue to decline in the third quarter to $600 million plus or minus and servicing expenses are moderately down quarter-on-quarter. MSR risk management was a net gain this quarter of $338 million, driven by a $220 million positive model update on slower prepayment fees which remember we would have earned otherwise overtime through [model miss] and which reflects the impact of the burn out of HART [inaudible] momentum. On real estate portfolios compensation on credit we see net charge off for the quarter of $111 million and reserve releases of $300 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio reflecting actual and expected appreciation in home prices. There were no reserve releases in the quarter for the non-credit impaired portfolio although [inaudible] trends do continue. We do expect to see reserve releases in NCI over the next couple of years in total between $500 million and $1 billion as the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve and lastly on real estate portfolios in the quarter we added $5 billion of loans to the portfolio.  Finally mortgage headcount was down approximately $5,000 year-to-date and we expect to exceed our investor day target of approximately $6,000 for the full year of 2014. Turning to page seven, Card Merchant Services and Auto, net income of $840 million, down 33% year-on-year or down 11% excluding reserve releases delivering an ROE of 18%. While down on declining reserve releases, the results do reflect strong underlying metrics. Sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 25th consecutive quarter primarily due to strong sales engagement of new customers. Our new acquisitions vintages are performing exceptionally well.  In Merchant Services we have seen strong volume and transaction growth year-over-year with our client sales volume gaining momentum reflecting several large account wins in the quarter. Strong revenue of $4.6 billion was up slightly quarter-on-quarter but down 3% year-on-year and when you think about the year-on-year decline we\u2019ve reached the point where spread compression and strong fee growth are flat. So the net decline is driven by high amortization of customer acquisition cost and the absence of fees related to discontinued products in 2013. Expense was up 8% quarter-on-quarter and $0.07 year-on-year driven by control, the timing of marketing investments and this quarter includes $125 million of the legal expense I talked about. Moving on to credit, losses continue to improve albeit at a slower pace and the card net charge-off rate has remained very low at 288 basis points and we released $50 million of student lending reserves in the quarter. Card outstanding momentum has shifted. End of period outstanding grew by $1.8 billion or 1.5% year-over-year with growth coming across our product set fueled by the strong sales performance I highlighted. Core growth is now outpacing one-offs and we acquired over 2 million new accounts in the quarter, up 40% year-on-year. Before we move on, a few words on Auto, new vehicle sales continue to grow year-on-year and the June start results reached the highest levels since 2006. We\u2019ve seen the 11th straight quarter of loan and lease growth as our partners continue to outpace the general market which remains competitive. The auto pipeline remain healthy consistent with the recovery in the auto market. Moving onto slide eight, and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $9 billion and an ROE of 13%. In banking total revenue was $3.1 billion, down 3% year-on-year. IB fees at $1.8 billion, up 3%. We maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic and widened the gap to number two. Revenue growth was driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees and loans and underwriting fees were up we had strong and relative performance for the quarter. The IB pipeline remains solid with an environment supportive of M&A and a large diversified IPO backlog. Treasury services revenue of a $1 billion was in line with our guidance, down 4% year-on-year driven by lower trade finance revenue and the impact of business simplification. And lending revenue was down $80 million year-on-year driven by low NII that was up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to Markets and Investor Services, reported markets revenue was down 14% year-on-year versus our guidance of 20% plus or minus with fixed down 15% and equities revenue down 10%. Included in these results are gains of over $100 million on the sale of market partner shares post IPO. Excluding this our results would have been down 15% year-on-year. In fixed the decline was driven broadly across macro products and in commodities with volatility remaining very low and with the exception of a few more active weeks in June volumes also low. In equities, the decline was driven by derivatives where client volumes are highly correlated to volatility levels.  In terms of outlook for the coming quarter and the second half, June was a better month somewhat broadly but that momentum has not continued into July so far and volatility remains very low across products. As such it is our [central case] that the third quarter will face a similar environment through the first half of 2014 and we expect normal seasonal trends. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposit and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. AUC reached a record $21.7 trillion up 14% year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter revenue was up on seasonality in the depository receipt and agent lending businesses. Moving on to expense, total expenses was up 6% year-on-year. Compensation expense was down 8% with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 31%. And we expect the full year comp-to-revenue ratio to likely end between 30% and 35% rather than at the low end of the range. Non-compensation expense was up year-on-year by 20% with the quarter including over $300 million of legal expense and a little less than $300 million of non-core expenses associated with business simplification I mentioned earlier. Moving on to Page nine, on the Commercial Bank, we have very good earnings from the Commercial Bank this quarter with net income up 6% from last year and an ROE of 19%. We saw strong performance on key underlying business drivers, driving revenue of $1.7 billion up 3% sequentially, with gross ID fees up 25% year-on-year driving the first half of the year to a record and on a higher NII driven by higher loan volume and day counts.  We added $3.3 billion of loans in the quarter with growth across the board in all of our businesses. Our consistent growth in real estate continued with loans up 2% in the quarter and 14% in the year and after a flat start to year we are happy to see C&I growth of 3% in the quarter in line with the industry. Revolver utilization picked up three percentage points versus the end of last year. Pipelines are up which should be supportive of trend in the second half of the year. The environment remains competitive but stable driving some continuous spread compression and we continue to see some pricing pressure to varying degrees in the businesses.  Expense was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter but higher than last year reflecting our commitment to the regulatory and control agenda. Expect expenses for the businesses of approximately $700 million in the third quarter. And our credit performance remains exceptional with net recoveries in the quarter. Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management, an excellent quarter in asset management with net income of $552 million up 10% year-on-year and 25% quarter-on-quarter, with a 25% ROE and 30% pretax margin hitting our three [inaudible] target. For the full year these ratios will be slightly lower as the business continuous to invest in both infrastructure and control as well as select tranches of hiring, but we\u2019re on track to deliver at our target for the full year of 2015. Revenue was $3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting an increase in management fees driven by record long term net inflows of $34 billion for the quarter, including the benefit of a large institutional fixed income mandate. This marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of long term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 16% year-on-year, and we continue to expect strong flows going forward. Looking at the mix of flows by product, we saw continued strength in our multi-asset and alternative flows, inline with our best quarter. In fixed income we had our strongest quarter flows ever and our best quarter in over a year excluding the large mandate I mentioned. And lastly despite solid equity performance in the quarter flows did not follow as investors showed hesitance to add to their positions at these levels.  Expense of $3.1 billion with up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher cost of controls and investment in growth.  Lastly in banking we reported solid performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances surpassed the $100 billion mark up 17% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter with growth coming from both our U.S. and our international markets. We continue to see a solid pipeline for loan demand for the remainder of the year. And the average deposits were also up year-on-year by 8% but seasonally down 1% sequentially. Moving on to page 11 and Corporate Private Equity, private equity overall had a flattish result, driven by net gain on dispositions partly offset by unrealized losses. And our private equity portfolio declined by approximately $1 billion. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million, NII was a negative 10. That\u2019s up by $80 million by quarter-on-quarter driven by high investment security balances and the continued benefit of higher reinvestment yield. In the quarter we deployed $27 billion in gross new investment.  Finally on this page other corporate net income was over $400 million. Included in the results are tax related benefit of over $200 million and as I mentioned earlier we reported firm wise legal expense pretax of $670 million for the quarter of which $227 million is here on corporate.  Moving on to outlook on page 12, we did receive positive feedback from our most recent guidance disclosure in the 10-Q so we replicated it and updated it here.  A few final comments, it is too early for us to give specific guidance for market revenues but we do expect the current environment to persist into the third quarter and to the second half and also experience no more seasonal trends. For the third quarter we generally expect mortgage production to be similar to this quarter, a small negative. We expect firm wide adjusted expenses for the full year of $58 billion plus or minus and expect credit trends to continue to be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest. So to wrap up a very, very strong result for the quarter notwithstanding headwinds, reflecting the strength of each of our businesses and the benefit of our operating model. With that operator we would like to open up the lines for questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC:  \u2026that you have shared in the past if you have a parallel shift of a 100 basis points, what that will do to your net interest revenue? Marianne Lake : So Gerald you got cut off at the beginning but you are asking for earning -- the risk on the 100 basis points shift. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: That's correct. Marianne Lake : It was in the first quarter and we haven't disclosed it yet for the second quarter but it wouldn\u2019t be meaningfully different in the first quarter, it was $2.5 billion. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Do you see, going forward that changing in the way you are approaching your interest sensitivity, as the likelihood of rising interest rates increases in 2015 or should it remain pretty much constant? Marianne Lake : So I mean the risk is a representation, it\u2019s an instantaneous parallel shift. If you look actually at our disclosures you can also see what a steepening looks like. So the way I would characterize the way to think about the impact of asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at our Investor Day and at the Morgan Stanley Conference which is when rates rise, whenever that starts which maybe in the second half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continued, that overtime that would deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of NII for the firm but clearly the path to get there would be rate dependent and timing. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Tying into the higher interest rates you have been vocal about your funding side of the equation and you what you expect there. Can you give us an update or more color of how you are positioned for the funding side of the balance sheet should rates rise and how much you expect to potentially maybe move off your balance sheet as it gets re-priced into different types of products? Jamie Dimon : This is Jamie. I think on the funding side and we said we\u2019ve met pretty much LCR and SFS and we think it will be the [GLAC] or at least we are very close to it. That's all embedded in interest rate exposure which Marianne gave you and that's our base case. Obviously if the world changes we may change how we go about and do that. But that I think it's a very good base case to look at. We don't have any need to change it dramatically. You all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise will obviously will change why people act in a certain way. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: And my final question is there has been some talk about the regulators, the Federal Reserve maybe increasing the capital ratios for the largest banks to even higher levels than what you are mandated today to carry. Do you guys have any thoughts on whether that may actually ever get through that they may even raise the current Tier I common ratio numbers? Jamie Dimon : I think we would have to wait and see. Remember the United States has already gone beyond most other countries and they may just be referring to that, that they intend to keep that or how they modify that. Marianne Lake : And I think the way that we think about -- obviously we don't know how things may change in the future but between the recent surcharge, the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that with LCR and SFR already entitled in the framework with capital stress comp testing under [SICAR] under extremely severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around it and so we're planning to run the firm based on what we know today with an eye on obviously listening to all other things you hear. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Great, and Jamie good luck on your treatment and I hope for a speedy recovery. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Good morning. Jamie first of all let me say it's nice to hear you on the call and that you are sounding good and that the prognosis sounds great and I wish you all the best. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Just a follow-up on the interest rate point for a second, I know you guys have been very focused on the potential for a deposit drain as things are handled somewhat differently by the Fed given the current circumstances when they eventually do raise rates. Is there any change in that thinking of the potential for a trillion-ish deposit drain and maybe a $100 million for yourselves on the basis of the fed minutes from last week which maybe were a little contradictory in terms of the mechanics to that Peterson Institute article which has been I think front of mind in everyone's thinking? Jamie Dimon : So keep in mind, the Fed whether they use repo or just sell securities that will reduce deposits. It's a factor with an absolute formula. The question is who\u2019s deposits, what kind of deposits and when they might do something like that, I assume they will be very careful. I think what we're simply were saying that some of the deposits will come out of non-operating wholesale deposits already have [HQA], some won\u2019t, some will come out of retail and just people will need to be prepared for it. I wouldn't from the category just when these be prepared and be very thoughtful about how we go about that. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: And given where you are on LCR, do you feel like JPMorgan is completely positioned as it will want to be at that time or is that still just a bill that's going to take place in liquidity between now and year from now or so? Jamie Dimon : I think we're very comfortable where we are. Marianne Lake : Yeah and remember that we are running LCR is an important measure, it's a regulatory measure, you know we are measuring it, we are posting it but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity tests and we are comfortable with that. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Great. The other thing that I'd like on touch on is the expense guidance. Obviously it's ticked down somewhat again and that's probably partly because of the revenue outlook that we\u2019re looking at for this year. But is there anything implicit in that in terms of what we should expect for expenses beyond 2014 and then maybe you can elaborate a little bit on how you are thinking about core expense reductions given a consistently pretty sticky revenue environment? Marianne Lake : So I mean really what I would point you to is that the discussions that we had, largely at our Investor Day which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few years which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses both in servicing but more particularly in production. So that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond. We also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering and we saw that CBB expenses, our cost of controlled investment are moderating and Gordon outlined at Investor Day that the CBB business \u201814 through \u201816 as a relative marker would deliver approximately a $1 billion of expense efficiency but the profile of that we haven't been through.  And then Daniel is working through, as are all of the other CEOs the expense story in the CIB and being as diligent as you would expect him to be given the environment but one of our positions has always been that we are running this business for the longer term and we are going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure that we protect the franchise but that doesn't mean that we can\u2019t and won't be more efficient across the businesses. So we haven\u2019t actually given specific guidance at the firm wide level but that\u2019s the backdrop. Jamie Dimon : And I just want to reiterate that we always have waste cutting like real estate people straight through processing, vendors, things we think got a little sloppy, where we were located but we will never ever, ever stop investing in straight through processing better bankers, better training, chase that marketing, EBK is another new stop from branches so don't confuse the two. We are lumping them together for you, internally no one goes to a budget meeting says I get expenses down by cutting expenses on the really important things that we need for the future, no one. We are not going to run the company that way, we\u2019d rather earn less money. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. That's, that's helpful. And then a final one\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Including that is paying our people fairly. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. That's obviously important. One last one from me, there have been quite a few areas where you pulled back in order to ensure the ability to monitor and being compliance, third party mortgage origination was one, trade finance and in particular correspondent banking internationally another one, Is all of the foreseeable pull back in areas of business for control reasons pretty much known now or there other things that we should expect that you might be looking at? Marianne Lake : Well so I would say that we are, it's a matter of good housekeeping that we would constantly be looking at making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it make sense to do it but as a large matter, that macro matter we are working through the things that we talked about, some of the things that you mentioned and there were no significant changes. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. That's great. Thanks so much. Jamie Dimon : But we have got a 1,000 correspondent banks we sold CWK, it made very well, we sold RPS there are a bunch of product lines we\u2019ve either closed down or eliminated and a lot of that\u2019s in the works. We put a light -- enhanced monitoring our other businesses so we are well along the way but if something comes up that we think we should look at again we\u2019ll look at it again. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Okay. So actually let me just follow up on it to make sure that we don't over model revenues. Are there still meaningful incremental revenue declines that we should expect from all of those areas that have been discontinued? Marianne Lake : The most significant revenue effect that's not yet in our run-rate because the transaction is not yet closed is the exit of the physical commodity business and so obviously when that closes which maybe in the early part of the fourth quarter that would have an impact in revenues both in the quarter and then in our run-rate in 2015. Jamie Dimon : And we gave you a number at Investor Day, I wish I got that number. Marianne Lake : Well I could give you the numbers now, so at Investor Day we said that the impact in 2014 on revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion, just given the timing of the physical commodities deal, the impact in '14 is going to be closer to $1.3 billion of which about $500 million is in our run-rate already. Jamie Dimon : Is that [inaudible]. Marianne Lake : Yeah. And then you annualized the things that will be complete by the end of the year that 85% of everything is also going to get done. So once we close this year, the impact this year will be $1.3 billion. The annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that's still our best estimate. Jamie Dimon : And the important thing is for the franchises as the management, commercial banks, CIB, CCB are all doing really, really well and this doesn't affect their ability to serve their clients at all. Marianne Lake : And remember also just for the purpose of completeness I'd be remiss if I not state the expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and that remember these are in large part businesses that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm\u2019s return, so important to remember that. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: Great. Thanks for the completeness of the answer. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Hey there. Marianne Lake : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Hello there. So we've seen a greater number of sales in the Repo market and it seems to me of just an issue of available collateral but I am curious to get your take, how much we're supposed to carry and whether or not some of the actions by treasury can and the reverse repo market can take care of that? Jamie Dimon : Look I think because the treasury, the government is still buying a big portion of net treasury issuance and because they are doing it going in the repo market and taking cash out of the system I think that number has maybe gone from $100 billion to $200 billion overtime. Remember I believe that, that Repo can't be re-hypothecated. So I do think some of the things will cause some issues in the repo market but my guess is that will sort through overtime. We do believe we\u2019ll see dealers reducing their books in Repo and you have heard a lot of statements about repo and collateral and capital against it, so I think that will sort out over time. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. Good. It sounds like you are not losing too much sleep over it. Jamie Dimon : Not yet. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Marianne you mentioned a comment on when you talked about C&I loan growth I just wanted to get a clarification. Last quarter if I remember correctly it was about flattish on year-on-year basis and you spoke about price competition and some discipline on JPMorgan's part. This quarter you have a little bit more year-on-year growth, still mention the comment about discipline but I just wanted to get a clarifying statement, is this growth a little bit better, is the backdrop a little bit better and you expect to participate in that a little bit more. Marianne Lake : Yeah, so I would say that there hasn't been a step shift in sentiment but the sentiment is better. It feels like year-over-year it\u2019s better quarter-over-quarter and it has allowed up to -- it\u2019s delivered right in line with the industry. And we do however maintain, absolutely maintain credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial side. So it is competitive. It hasn't been the case that we've historically been losing on price, it has been more on [inaudible] and on simplification and listing but\u2026 Jamie Dimon : I think Marianne mentioned that in almost every category of C&I and on the commercial bank utilization was up by 1% last quarter and maybe 1%... Marianne Lake : Utilization in commercial was up 3% at the end of the year. Jamie Dimon : Since the end of the year. Utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting to expand and early on it's receivables and inventory. You haven't really seen in capital expenditures yet and if you look at the U.S. capital expenditures in total including big businesses they are kind of flat to down, that will ultimately be the driver of real growth. So if you start to see that you are going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization is I think is the first sign. Glenn Schorr - ISI: I appreciate that. The last one is I just couldn't help notice the balance sheet is now at $2.5 trillion. In your discussions -- I know we can't purchase our way through without jumping a lot of hurdles but do you feel constrained on just sheer balance sheet size, I mean you are and the reason I ask I look across most of your franchisees they are growing and they are growing nice and they are growing organically to the investments you have made. I just wanted to know if anybody is bringing up the issue of just absolute size? Jamie Dimon : No, but I just give you a number that, like I think year-over-year that balances up mostly to the money we have at the fed, even quarter-over-quarter you got this -- we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around the world. We have an investment portfolio of $350 billion, we\u2019ve a loan portfolio of $700 billion. We already told you when they start to reverse QE III some of those will automatically come down. So our balance sheet is kind of high because of all this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully there will be more loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Eventually maybe a little capital return too? Marianne Lake : Yeah, just to illustrate the point if you look at, if you are looking at the slides you are looking end of period assets that grew by $40 billion or so. If you look at the average it was only $18 billion. We got a lot of volatility around the cash move at quarter end. So Jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our -- has been deposit and ultimately funds like on deposit with the central bank. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Great, I appreciate the answer. Marianne Lake : I would say again having said that of course we are, there is a natural healthy tension now with leverage roles that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that would have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth if there is growth to be more modest. Jamie Dimon : And we are also seeing -- we are talking about G50, the big Chinese banks, the big Japanese banks and some other banks around the world growing really rapidly. Hopefully that will reduce our G50 growth a little bit too. Marianne Lake : And if we are right about the liquidity drain in QE you will see a bunch of deposits flow out essentially in the second half of next year and you see some of that will reverse. Glenn Schorr - ISI: All right. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : A couple of questions, one FICC, one in expenses and one on RWAs. Just on the FICC line you mentioned that it was a little bit better in the last part of June and then you went on to say that the outlook is for current environment to persist. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about which environment, you are talking about just the overall quarter, because the quarter ends up being a little bit better than expected right in the mid part of the quarter. Are you suggesting that you know the end of June activity is, is likely to keep a positive tone to what's you are expecting in third quarter. Marianne Lake : Thank you for the question. Because I want to make sure I am very clear. So in June we did see an uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it, no catalyst that would lead up to believe that was necessary to continue and as we have moved into July it so far has being our experience that has not continued at that level. So it is more -- our guidance for second half is that 15% to 20%, the 20% plus or minus decrease that we have seen in the past for that kind of environment is the one that we're facing over the second half. Now we are not guiding to a number because as you very well know it -- have many -- days into the quarter and things can change that. So you are going to have to pick your level but we can't predict it any better than that. Jamie Dimon : In forecast, it's our operating assumption it going to stay at low levels for a while. We know we are going to be wrong in that but you will have to pick whatever you think. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Sure. Okay. Jamie Dimon : We run the company planning for low and hoping for better. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And that's 15% year-on-year? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : That's 15% plus or minus down year-on-year? Marianne Lake : We are not giving a specific guidance, it was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second, that kind of environment. Jamie Dimon : The third quarter\u2019s generally lower and it could be lower than that\u2026 Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then on the expenses you have outlined a couple of different areas that you are working on to get the expenses down. The question is on -- why in the IB you've got the repositioning cost called out specifically. Because I'm just kind of thinking aloud that those -- you've got to investigate expense saves in a broad, broad sort of areas of the business. So why call it out in the IB, does it suggest that we'll see more repo cost coming through in other areas over the next several quarters as people roll out their expense plans? Marianne Lake : So we called out the $300 million if that\u2019s what you are referring in the CIB because it in our view anyway is a modestly sized and non-recurring item. We are not expecting to have similar items like that, we may have some but we are certainly not forecasting that we are going to have that kind of level recurring. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And the other\u2026 Marianne Lake : So really I'll just give you a sense that in the quarter we\u2019ve built that number and -- what you were to do with it in terms of your models but we don\u2019t consider that to be called. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay but in the other areas where you are also working on expense programs you don\u2019t expect that that you are going to have any of those kind of one time repo items, repositioning items. Marianne Lake :  No at this time, not significant. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, all right and then on the RWAs you indicated that RWAs were up a little bit on op risk down on marketing credit risk and then you went on to say that it was model related, is that all your internal models, is that based on consultation with regulators, I am just wondering why the op rates could have gone up for you given that you had your big settlement a couple of quarters ago? Marianne Lake : Yeah, so first of all these are all the moving parts, none of them are materially significant. So operating risk went up a little bit, growth in op a little bit and offset against that we continue to always on board positions on to our proved models continued to develop our models and get approvals for our models, so that we can have the most efficient RWA that we can have and so we saw some of that and also portfolio run-off. So we were just giving you some color that flat RWA is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at Investor Day that will ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months. Jamie Dimon : Well a little inconsistent up-fronting all the negatives fully phased in we are not up-fronting model approvals we expect to get. Marianne Lake :  Our model onboarding. Jamie Dimon : A model onboarding or stuff like that there were some of that coming and obviously those need to be approved by regulators. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Got it, okay and then Steve said the other day including again CDOs, you had some CDOs back in the day, does that impact how you are thinking about the op risk charges? Jamie Dimon : Not material. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Jamie Dimon : We are doing run off all the time for RWA and everything else is not material and they could be restructured, I think those are 2017 now and\u2026 Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : All right, hey thanks a lot. Marianne Lake :  Thanks, Betsy. Operator :  And your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein :  Hi Marianne following up on loan growth commentary, net interest income dollars seemed a little better than you expected at $11 billion are you still looking for that to be flattish kind of top of the house NII for this year or is the outlook a little better given the loan growth trends. Marianne Lake :  So we said relatively flat. It came up slightly in the quarter and obviously we are pleased with that and we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be our best assessment. If loan growth does continue to improve and improve to the point where our core loan growth is above 5% then yes we would hope to enjoy that NII benefit. But as we look forward based upon current rates broadly flat with a little bit above the bias is our outlook until rates start to rise. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : Okay In terms of share buy back\u2026 Marianne Lake : Because you do continue to have, albeit that everything is a little bit less than it was but you do continue to have offset against that in terms of spread compression. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : Okay so with the 5% core loan growth you expect NII to be relatively flat this year and flat to up a little bit next year. Marianne Lake :  Yes, it\u2019s market and slide curve is in fact how things play out. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein :  And then on share buyback could you give us some thoughts about how you are thinking about using your buyback approval for this year, did you accelerate some of the buyback activity on price weakness in this quarter and do you expect to do more in second half because the RWA reductions are starting to happen? Marianne Lake : So first of all obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do. But yes we did articulate that we were going likely back end our share repurchases as we build to [RT ET1] ratio. You can obviously see we have built towards that nicely at 9.8% and then yes obviously particularly in the first half of the quarter our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things.  When we look at the second half without giving specifics because we don\u2019t give guidance on repurchase we have the capacity to do $5 billion more growth over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit about 10% and we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And on the mortgage servicing revenues the outlook that you gave for $600 million roughly does that include any MSR risk management gains or do you assume none in that, can you just clarify that? Marianne Lake : We assume none in that. Think about the MSR risk management as we generally speaking expect our results to be close to home say plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : Okay, and last question on legal cost this quarter they are mostly in the IB and in corporate, any commentary on what type of issues you\u2019re currently accruing for and also could you clarify whether you have any remaining outstanding material mortgage litigation or is that mostly settled from the mortgage area? Marianne Lake : So as much as I know you want to hear it and we\u2019re not going to talk about the specifics that what we are aiming for and we told you -- we said before that we had very little in the first quarter, we have $700 million now. It\u2019s going to be this way for a while we\u2019re going to have elevated and lumpy litigation cost as work through the issues that you\u2019re aware of and with respect to mortgage we have battled with a large proportion of our NBS risks with the government account policy so we do still have some other civil claims. We would characterize there is more behind us than in front of us and we\u2019re working through it. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein :  Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi. First, why did trading do better than the guidance earlier in the quarter and did that relate to the 8% increase in trading bar which was a little surprising since volatility is still low? Marianne Lake : Okay so just on the absolute performance, so first of all few things primarily contributed to the better performance. We said 20% plus or minus remember that, really could have been plus or minus when you go back three weeks before quarter end. There was a better activity in June. So June was a stronger month, every day on average produced a strong result than the prior few months in that and we didn\u2019t have line of sight to that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance and the second I called out the market partners, shared the IPO and we --- post the IPO and generated gains of over $100 million which is a couple of points. Jamie Dimon : And as far as, it\u2019s very hard to predict FICC really reluctant to do it, because somehow you think you actually know it\u2019s going to be -- I am couple of weeks. And the bar jumps around but some of that something around is nearly think of underlying positions [CMDS] and warehouse positions and stuff like that, which come and go. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay no, I always prefer more guidance than less. And then I have two very simple questions with complicated answer I guess but you talked about loan growth, is this the inflection point for loan growth and on the one hand you said while there is some inventory build that\u2019s helping and on other hand you\u2019re not seeing CapEx yet and two quarters ago you said second half of the year loan growth should really accelerate, do you still believe this should accelerate from this level, is this the acceleration or you\u2019re revising back some of those expectations? Marianne Lake : So what we said Mike is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be optimistic that we\u2019re going to continue to see growth around those levels in the second half of the year. Like I said it\u2019s not that we\u2019ve seen a step change but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates, generally higher pipelines and the phones are ringing, it\u2019s cross geographies. So it feels like the environment is conducive for us to continue to be able to add. We\u2019ve been very successful in the business banking space and yes in cards, so it\u2019s our belief that we\u2019ll have strong year-over-year in the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And if interest rates increase at some point that could hurt the ability of commercial and commercial real estate borrowers to service their debt. How much cushion is there before you think that would become an issue or that\u2019s just not a factor? Jamie Dimon : I just want to add it\u2019s not really a fact of people who are already income producing locked in rates and things like that and they really won\u2019t be effective for people who want to build new things. But not only on the commercial side but we did look at on the residential side, there have been occasion we have rising rates and improving housing. So depending why rates are going may be the more determinant factor than just the fact that rates are going up. Rates are going up to able to help the economy and maybe more important than just the fact the rates going up, right. We have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should. Mike Mayo - CLSA: I guess the more general question is what areas in credit are you watching the most, I think Marianne you said auto was the best since 2006 and that\u2019s been an area mentioned by regulators, is that the point of greatest concern or are there other areas you are watching more closely? Marianne Lake : Well, what we are doing is being consistent on our credit discipline. And so we are still facing partly in the first half of the year about -- are not participating in some of the growth that others do because we have maintained a line as it relates to particularly structured credit, label, credit structures and addresses structures rather pricing. And so we are consistently doing that. We are not changing that and our credit books across our auto, mortgage, commercial remains consistent, we are not changing that either. So for us we\u2019re just maintaining our credit discipline, but yes, I mean, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the product and so we are seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. We saw it in the quarters coming up we still see now although it\u2019s not worth. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right, thank you. Operator :  Your next question is from the line from Erika Najarian with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Good morning. My questions have all been asked and answered. Thank you. Marianne Lake :  Thanks Erika. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank :  Good morning. Marianne Lake :  Good morning, Matt. Jamie Dimon :  Good morning. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Can you remind us the timing of the private equity sale and how much capital against that. It was profitably a breakeven business, I think you know about 6 billion of outstanding and what does that mean in terms of freeing your capital in the Basel III and SLR? Jamie Dimon : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that. It hasn\u2019t been a breakeven business over a long period of time. Obviously hasn\u2019t earned much money in the last few quarters and we are still -- if we go and change something it could be soon. It won\u2019t be all of what we take, it will be a part of it. And then the part of the number you see, I think the $6 billion of total buyback are all heritage investments were made by JPMorgan Chase and et cetera before the Bank One merger. Marianne Lake :  That will continue. Jamie Dimon :  So, they are all eventually that $6 billion will be zero. And that frees up about $3 billion of equity capital respectively. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, $3 billion that\u2019s helpful. And then other commodities business you gave us the $2.8 billion of annual revenue give-up and said that was ROE dilutive but care to give expenses and capital against that? Marianne Lake : Yeah, so, just to be clear the $3.8 billion if you go back and look at Investor Day was all of our business simplification agenda not the physical commodities. I just pulled out physical commodities as being A, a big piece of it; and B, us staying in the piece the biggest piece left to happen in 2014, so just to be clear on that. And then yes the $3.8 billion came with expenses of $3.2 billion again it, we didn\u2019t disclose the capital but when you take that into consideration it was at or below our cost of capital not additive to return. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then lastly this is probably an obvious question but the $100 million gain related to IPO would have been booked in the equity trading business when you are talking about the impact to the markets revenues? Marianne Lake : Actually it didn\u2019t effect. Matthew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse :  Okay, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But could you talk just a little bit about how much of the mortgage business cost are fixed and how much you would be willing to let the volume decline? Marianne Lake :  Yeah, so we haven\u2019t actually broken out specifically in that way but I can characterize it for you. So obviously in mortgage production; the first you know chunk of expenses it\u2019s really variable meaning it\u2019s paying for production on a variable basis to the sales force and then you have a bunch of what we call semi-fixed cost which are effectively the operated, the people you know the sort of FTEs and then you do have pre-fixed cost which is the management, the real estate, the technology when you have a very, very slow market which I think you would agree at $1.1 trillion or lower market its very slow then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business particularly if you are taking a hard line which we are on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in but over time it doesn\u2019t stop the fact that this is going to be healthy company functioning mortgage market everyone to be [inaudible]. So it\u2019s tricky in this kind of very, very small market to but we are focused on fixing our fix cost base and trying to get out as much efficiency as possible. Jamie Dimon :  And we have being spending a lot of time of that doing deep dives and trying to figure out and unfortunately this one won\u2019t be at the end of the year. I think it is hopefully by the end of 2015 we give you clear sight about how we would be making normal profitability there, Marianne Lake :  Right. Jamie Dimon : Which may take until 2016. Marianne Lake :  Yeah. And it would be in a technical volatile business and we had very, very strong performance over the quarter of 11 in \u201912, and into the first 2013 and we are now at that cyclical point, that cyclical node and we need a lot of things to happen but hopefully when I tell you that the fixed cost space is our number one process or among our number one processes and we are working very hard at it. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. So just of a small point, you mentioned a reserve release on the private student lending business. That was a business that you had kind of talked about potentially exiting I guess back in late last year. Is that still on the agenda or? Jamie Dimon : We are not exiting, just no longer doing it, and it's in run-off mode. Marianne Lake : Right. So we we stopped originating new loans but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are managing and as they run off we will experience usual charge off reserve releases they are not exiting. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Derek De Vries - UBS: Thanks. I have two questions. One is kind of a detailed question but I just want to make sure I understood correctly. You are talking about equity trading revenues and I think you sort of said the decline was attributable to the equity derivatives business. So can I imply that the year-on-year for cash and prime brokerage businesses were flat and all the decline came from equity derivatives is that what you said? Marianne Lake : We said it was driven by derivatives, cash and prime brokerage, the better prime did the better than cash. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. That's clear. And then just sort of a more conceptual question I look at your core loan growth of 4% obviously it was accommodated that\u2019s was very strong and I guess about two times the industry level and kind of reconciling that with the comments you made about C&I loan growth is kind of in-line when you are kind of ceding some market share in resi mortgage for all the reasons you have explained to us. So I was just wondering if you can give some color on those areas where you are clearly taking share and just some outlook on how sustainable that is or is it just kind of a good quarter? Marianne Lake : So just on the mortgage thing we are giving up share but remember that we distribute a significant amount of mortgages that we produce. In this quarter we actually portfolioed $5 billion of mortgages. So we are not losing share in those. Derek De Vries - UBS: Yeah I understand. Marianne Lake : So we are adding to the portfolio for mortgage it's slightly different dynamic. We are outperforming on sales prices in cards, so ultimately that would fuel outstanding growth that hopefully would be better than the industry but clearly it's modest at this point. I think we are inline if now potentially gaining a little share but we continue to outperform in real estate particularly in most real estate and asset management. Derek De Vries - UBS: Okay. And so I mean all those areas are areas you are targeting so they should feel pretty sustainable? Marianne Lake :  Yes. Derek De Vries - UBS: Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Thanks very much. I just wanted to just step back for a moment and think about you know what's occurred in the context of the key themes from investor day last February. And it sounds like there is a couple of areas where things maybe are progressing bit more slowly than you thought. Mortgage it sounds maybe one of them but I wonder if in the context of the goals that you laid out how you feel broadly you are moving against them and whether there has been any real departures from your expectation sort of at the halfway point of the year? Marianne Lake : So I think you called -- I think you called it well on mortgage. Obviously the mortgage market and housing conditions outside of [inaudible] are challenging and that looks like it\u2019s set to be a slower journey but if you step back and look at across all of our businesses when I talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly that reflects our strategy. So we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers as well as simplify and address the control agenda and we're making appropriate progress in both of those. And it showing in our results. I mean a quarter where obviously there are some challenges to print over 14 [inaudible] tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy workout. And if you were to read through the comments I made in asset management we're investing in the sales force. We are seeing deliver growth. We have record inflows we are seeing international delivered loan growth, it's very consistent. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Yeah and I guess the\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We have given you a roadmap on how we are going to get from 7% return on tangible common equity to 14. We are already at 14. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Right. So I guess the I mean the real heart of my question is we look at these financial results which are clearly better than expectations against the backdrop which maybe is certainly not better, maybe worse than, than what we thought at the beginning of the year. And I wonder if that then suggests that in fact things are accelerating ahead of the timeline or in greater magnitude than the discussion in February. Jamie Dimon : No, I can\u2019t overemphasize this, we do not run the company for quarterly profits. We make long-term decisions on people, systems technology, products services, stuff like that and lot of things drive short term profits, but the profit you have in any one quarter relate to decision you made for the last five years and so we feel great about these companies. The big weak spot which we\u2019ll acknowledge is mortgage and we\u2019re going to put, we got great people there, we\u2019re going to put elbow to the metal there, we\u2019re going to invest some more money in their systems. We got some catch up to do, we got caught in the middle of as you know WaMu origination platforms and we usually look at each of these businesses they are all doing fine and we\u2019re looking at how we can grow them over the next five to ten years. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.  I honestly I mean I don\u2019t care whether the FICC was up 10% or 15% or down 10% the next quarter. I actually think it\u2019s complete waste of time. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Okay and then maybe just lastly one of the themes from for this year has been the narrowing a little bit of the client base, based on risk of profitability profile. I'm just wondering how that\u2019s progressing particularly with respect maybe to the commercial bank? Jamie Dimon : I think most of that\u2019s been done. So you\u2019ve seen, not all of it, but the full effect of that in terms of which segments we\u2019re gaining on, and which ones we\u2019re going to focus on, which ones we are putting hands to monitoring and it\u2019s sort of same thing in the CIB with our correspondent banking. There may be more, we are always going to do good housekeeping. There are some clients we\u2019ve had conversations with they are still on the books but they will be leaving down the road, but none of those things would be material to the future of this company. That may affect revenues a little bit in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year that\u2019s not why we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re doing to protect ourselves, run the business properly meet our regulatory and control objectives. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : And so this is the last thing from me, but does that suggests that maybe we\u2019re getting closer to the point where the reported numbers in terms of the balance sheet, the loan expansion and the core numbers will get closer to converging? Marianne Lake : Think about the core number advantage, reported number being primarily driven by the legacy mortgage and credit card portfolio. So the client activity that we\u2019ve been talking about is immaterial in the context of that run-off portfolio, that what\u2019s driving the difference. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Thanks very much. Marianne Lake : We will continue to see that portfolio run off and as it runs off and gets smaller we will have less of an impact but it\u2019s been fairly consistent story. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Thanks good morning. On the consumer business just one last question about the payment side and we\u2019ve seen really good volume growth metrics and that\u2019s turned in the origination volumes, can you talk just about what you\u2019re seeing in the underlying customer as opposed to what you guys are benefiting from activation and on new car growth, just your general sense of the customer and spending? Marianne Lake : Yes so we have a lot of market stats that while we maybe outperforming the market what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what\u2019s happening and what I can tell you is if you see compared to our growth you have still strong high single-digit growth in non-discretionary spend categories driven principally in growth in the space which is not all enterprising but I it\u2019s actually about consumer spending and inflation. And then if you look at the discretionary growth which is growing even more strongly though in the double-digit territory it\u2019s across the board, it\u2019s travel, it\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s retail, it\u2019s across the board so consumers are spending very strongly in both categories. Jamie Dimon : And merchant processing we are growing like 12% a year and we\u2019re investing more money to do a better job for merchants there and so all of these things and $35 million people bank online I think it was 15 million who used mobile banking, it was 12 million to 15 million who used mobile banking. So you are going to see us extend products and services all of which hopefully will be merchant friendly and consumer friendly. Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company: And on that merchant piece just can you just explain the disconnect between the volume side, continuing to look better and then the transaction growth rates slowing a little bit recently, is it a larger ticket size or is there some different underlying things in the metrics? Jamie Dimon :  It\u2019s mostly merchants aggregating their transactions. Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company: So it\u2019s flows through to you guys. Marianne Lake : Correct. Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Okay great and then a little question, tax rate was a little low this quarter to your outlook generally speaking on the tax rate going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes so I mean, our general longer term outlook is on our tax rate is 30% plus or minus, just given obviously the pretax prices of the 2014 market it will be slightly lower than that, more inline with the quarter. Jamie Dimon : I don\u2019t know if you mentioned this in other the private equity which was close to zero and bounces around is treasury and CIO which was close to zero, kind of will stay there, and there\u2019s other corporate, a normal rate would be around 200. This quarter is around 400 because of some of the tax benefits. Think of that as going back to 200 give or take next quarter for your models. Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller - FBR: Yes. Thank you very much. I know a lot of questions have been asked, but I want to go back to mortgages a little bit the $16 billion, the market was up depending on who you listen to probably in the $260 billion to $300 billion range but you guys stayed relatively flat. And it looks like really you guys gave up market share with MBS issuance stuff that you sell to Fannie and Freddie and maybe you picked up more market share in the general market. Of the $5 billion that you portfolio, as you talked about was that all jumbos and you could talk a little bit about maybe stepping away from Fannie and Freddie? Marianne Lake : So of the $5 billion, $3.6 million was jumbo, about $400 million was [inaudible] and then about a $1 billion of conventional. But that\u2019s high -- mostly jumbo, yes and we\u2019re holding share in jumbo. And with respect to the market share loss it was principally two things, it was principally a strategy that we\u2019ve talked about to do less in the high priced, high LTV, low FICO space and we priced to the risk adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service the loans that default and that\u2019s what the impact has been on our market share and then also the HARP burn out we were very successful in helping our loans over the course of last couple of years, our borrowers who are technically eligible are no longer responding. So we\u2019re seeing that burn out.  The bit that\u2019s really truly the conventional loss which there was some, is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price. Jamie Dimon : So our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we\u2019ve lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA. We are trying to [inaudible] do better going forward. Just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million of insurance, they disputed $200 million, the government called that a fraud. We reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because it was a threatening lawsuit, even like in my opinion it was a commercial dispute between FHA and ourselves about that and the whole time FHA collected another $1.8 billion in premium. So the real question to me should we be in the FHA business at all and we\u2019re still struggling with that.  We want to help the consumers there but we can\u2019t do it at great risk to JPMorgan. So until they come up with some kind of Safe Harbors or something we\u2019re going to be very, very cautious in that line of business. Paul Miller - FBR: And Jamie a follow on question on your utilization comments, I thought was very good. But a lot of bankers have talked about as long as deposit is growing it\u2019s hard for their utilization rate to go up and we did see strong deposit growth and we\u2019re still seeing utilization rate. Should that deposit growth should start to go down if we are seeing an uptick in utilization rates? Jamie Dimon :   I think it slowed down a little bit. Marianne Lake : Yeah, it went down slightly in commercial. Jamie Dimon : And last remember there are so many different borrowers in industry so there might be some people are still accumulating deposits or some start to borrow money but in general you\u2019re right. Marianne Lake : Yeah so if you look at commercial just as an illustration of your point what we\u2019ve got going on is the utilization rate in the last two quarters have picked up by 33% still much, much lower than you would expect them to be overtime which would be probably about 40% but you do see deposits flattening out in fact there\u2019s a little bit of decline. It\u2019s not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend their deposits and utilize their lines and I think -- is still not really out there but that is what you\u2019d expect in this business we didn\u2019t see strong growth in deposits. Paul Miller - FBR: Okay, thank you very much guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Hi good morning. So Marianne I actually had a question about the presentation that you\u2019d given last month at the Morgan Stanley conference. You alluded to a targeted loan to deposit ratio of roughly 70% through the cycle and I supposed I was wondering when crunching some of the numbers given the proper treatment for loans versus high quality securities under the LCR, whether there is a peak level of loan to deposit ratio or growth that we should think about given the constraints, which exist under the new liquidity regime. Marianne Lake :  So first of all just to make a competitive point with it, we didn\u2019t have a target to loan to deposit we were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest rates on our performance overtime we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning MCDs but also expect to see the economy growing and loan growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. So it wasn\u2019t really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that. It was basically on levels that we have seen at least in parts of the cycle that we were referring to. And then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of LTR we will always have because of our liquidity requirements internal as well we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would have previously been. And therefore from a mix effect that would have an impact but at this point given where loans to deposits are I think that would be a high class problem to be talking about. Jamie Dimon :  And remember there are some unused lines, there is no loans in the balance sheet they still need a 100% LCR. So what\u2019s really going to happen is, it\u2019s going to be on decline level, capital LCR, commitments et cetera, we just have to manage it, at the capital level, the desk level et cetera. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Thanks, actually that\u2019s a great transition for my next question, which relates to pricing in some of the multiple binding constraints on capital that exists today. And some of the discussions that we had with your competitors have suggested that some believe that it\u2019s still a little bit too early to fully bake in the cost of managing to all the different capital real stats that exist today, whether it\u2019s risk based leverage based or even CCAR and it appears that you have been managing more actively through all the different constraints out there and in light of that I was wondering whether you have seen any impact for more aggressive pricing by peers in terms of your relative market share in certain product areas, particularly within the CIB? Jamie Dimon :  We see a little bit of this trade finance costs have gone up, a little bit in municipal businesses and there you have seen a little more restructuring of the type of business people do. Remember some of the repricing may not take place in the product. It may take place in the relationship because all products have lost leaders et cetera but we haven\u2019t seen a huge amount of repricing taking place yet. Marianne Lake :  And I think if you think about\u2026 Jamie Dimon :  I have heard some complaints by the way that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter, not the price as much of it is the sizing and then you\u2019ve heard some commentary in the market that inventories bonds are lower and being gapped out, spreads are gapped out, so you\u2019re trying to see some of it but eventually I have never seen a business where the costs of goods sold doesn\u2019t eventually get priced in the business. It doesn\u2019t happen to be priced into the egg or the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction the whole bag, the person walks out to the supermarket would. Marianne Lake :  And I think one way to look at it is to say well we are absolutely managing through this complex environment Basel III Tier I comments still is our binding constraint at the moment and that\u2019s how we allocate capital in the businesses and that\u2019s the sort of primary lend that we are using to price and what you are going to see as Jamie talked about is that the leverage and LTR and other constraints including stressed capital are going to play out at the client level as we just all are becoming more efficient about how we deploy our balance sheet, rather than necessarily a re-pricing strategy. Jamie Dimon :  And CCAR we will push the CCARs down to the extent we can we will push the CCAR down -- those things which create CCARness. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Thanks and I suppose could you give potentially any context as to what event may prompt that repricing, whether even if the leverage rules are finalized and officially implemented this year do you expect that\u2019s when you will begin to see a lot of your peers begin to reprice some of these effects into their inventory or into their trading securities or is it -- are they likely going to delay at least the repricing until the rules are fully implemented which is, going to be a 2018 event? Jamie Dimon :  I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath, I mean some people leaving businesses, some optimize the decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen overtime and we are quite patient about it. We are in no rush. We are not going to try to lead it or anything like that, it will happen overtime. As I said you have seen it in trade finance, you\u2019ve seen in municipal businesses, you have seen it in - I know the rules aren\u2019t final, when the rules become final then people may react differently. Steven Chubak - Nomura: All right, great. That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Jamie Dimon :  You\u2019re welcome. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell - Buckingham Research :  Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the SLR. It seems like the improvement you had sequentially was I think mostly driven by capital in the preferred issuance. Can you give us sort of where we are in terms of compression trades and the impact is it still more a lot more to come or is that mostly in there and then I guess any thoughts or updates on [exactly] what impact can be and if you expect that to be adopted by the fed? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, just on the -- yes, the improvement at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, plus capital attribution but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage including compression trades and pay-offs and the like. That is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we have thought just broadly in the industry it still presents an opportunity if not the most sizeable opportunity but we are diligently getting after it.  And then with respect to SCAR we estimate it in clearly it\u2019s the complex calculation so we will be slightly wrong in our estimate. We estimated it to have a benefit to the firm of 35 points and for the bank of 45 points. Yes we would expect that at some point it will be ultimately adopted by the U.S. regulators but that doesn\u2019t look likely to be helping our numbers this year or next. James Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, got you. And then maybe just I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s not related or not but if I looked at your derivatives receivable on the balance sheet it\u2019s been declining pretty steadily down 20% year-on-year. Is that reflective of just demand or given low volatility and low activity levels or is there something structural there, are you guys actively managing your receivables down or just trying to get a sense you know how much the cyclical versus structural argument? Marianne Lake : It\u2019s substantially cyclical. James Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay. Marianne Lake :  I mean I wish we could be -- I wish we could actively manage it down because it\u2019s part of our part of our (inaudible) calculation but the truth of the matter is a factor of activity level. James Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, it\u2019s primary activity levels. Okay. And one last one on the CDO question, I think earlier I think we saw Citigroup settle with DOJ regarding in the included CDOs I don\u2019t your settlement included that. Is that something that you think all remains out there or just something unique to them, I know you have you did settle one, one complaint with the SEC a few years ago just want to get a sense of how you think about that any remaining litigation risk around CDOs? Thanks. Marianne Lake : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant. James Mitchell - Buckingham Research :   Okay, thank you. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :   Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up Jamie on the FAJ commentary you had. I\u2019m just wondering about the implications for how you hit the CRA requirements. Is there any interplay there? Jamie Dimon :  Yes, the CRA number is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages. So we will obviously try to meet to those commitments, it include how many branches you have in lower-middle income so we\u2019ll continue to build that. It\u2019s a function of CDFI like lending to small business or community development funds which we will continue to do. So it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our CRA commitment. Yes if you don\u2019t do any FHA that hurts you a little bit but to do FHA and lose billions of dollars that\u2019s a whole different level of shareholder responsibility and so we have got to be very careful how we handle that. I\u2019m hoping FHA comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors that make it easy for us to try to do what the government wants us to do, but we can\u2019t get penalized severely for some of the things that happen. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :   Doing in the FHA you have got the Ginnie\u2019s to their 4-year RWAs were lower, doing -- getting the same credit for CRA and loans is obviously a little bit more capital consumptive so that\u2019s part of the challenge? Jamie Dimon :  It\u2019s all of that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :   Yes, okay. Jamie Dimon : We are going to meet CRA. We report CRA results every month and like I said it cuts across a wide variety of things that we do for people. We just did this great thing at Detroit that lots of CRA credits. We can do mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less risky than FHA, insurance so we will figure it out. This is just a category we just thoroughly, thoroughly confused about how we got treated, how we got to do it going forward and what kind of -- and we\u2019ve spoken to government for some kind of guidance going forward. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :   Great. So this is on the reps and warranties on the FHA? Jamie Dimon :  Yes. Marianne Lake :  Well it\u2019s still\u2026 Jamie Dimon :  It\u2019s the reps and warrants that there should be a commercial resolution dispute we don\u2019t have [triple damages] if something goes wrong. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator :  Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our web site. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm delivered strong underlying performance this quarter with net income of $5.6 billion on strong revenue of over $25 billion, up 5% year-on-year, reflecting growth across most of our businesses, and EPS of $1.36 and the return on tangible common equity of 13% for the quarter. Included in our results with firm-wide legal expense of approximately $1 billion after tax, which relates to a number of matters in large part and estimated amount for FX which was treated as non-deductable tax purposes. There were also a number of smaller items, most notably a benefit of approximately $400 million of tax discrete items in corporate as well as consumer reserve releases of $200 million pre tax. Excluding these and other non-core items, net income was approximately $5.8 billion reflecting strong core performance.  The quarter was characterized by continued strengths in our leadership positions as well as market share gains across the consumer businesses. Higher levels of market volatility and client volumes than anticipated in CIB and record performance in asset management. Core loan growth for the quarter was strong up 7% year-on-year while maintaining strong discipline across the board and with encouraging trends in consumer. We\u2019ve also continued to make progress against our capital targets with a CET 1 ratio of 10.1% and firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5%. All while returning approximately $3 billion as capital to shareholders the quarter, with growth share repurchases of $1.5 billion. Turning to page two, adjusted expense that excluding legal was $14.7 billion in the third quarter, down approximately 30 million quarter-on-quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 59%. We continued to be focused and diligent on managing expenses, although our third quarter adjusted expense may appear elevated in comparison to our full year target of 58 billion, it was substantially driven by higher market performance versus our earlier expectations. If the positive momentum continues in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s likely that our total adjusted expense will be above $58 billion but obviously on higher revenues. On credit, despite lower reserve releases firm wide credit costs remained very low driven by reduced net charge-offs. We expect total net charge-offs for 2014 to be less than $5 billion which is below our previous guidance. Also included on this page are the returns generated by each of our businesses this quarter. Of note the commercial bank and asset management achieved 18% and 25% ROEs respectively in line with their previous cycle target. CCB was at 19% and if you back out the impact of legal expense in CIB its ROE would have been around 14%. Moving on to capital on Page 3. The firm reported a fully phased in advanced CET 1 ratio of 10.1% up from 9.8 last quarter reaching our year-end target of 10% plus. Not on the page but for your information the fully phased in standardized ratio was 10.5%. As you know the final U.S. rules on SLR and LTR were published in September, on SLR there were no notable changes and as I just mentioned the firm\u2019s SLR was 5.5% reaching our target level and we\u2019re at 5.7% for the bank this quarter. The LTR final U.S. rule had some changes versus the NPR, remember we have been disclosing our LTR compliance relative to the Basel rules. The U.S. final rule is in some ways more punitive but we remain compliant with a more modest buffer. Moving on to business performance starting with CCB on Page 4. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.5 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the right hand side of the page; it shows that the long-term investments we\u2019ve been making in the business are paying off. Illustrated by the many leadership positions we hold, we\u2019re particularly proud of our customer satisfaction rankings. We\u2019re seeing continued strong growth in the underlying business drivers, average deposits were up 35 billion year-on-year, an increase of 8%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22% and credit card sales volume of $120 billion was up 12% on strong new account originations. Across CCB we\u2019ve reduced headcount by over 10,000 this year against our year-end target of 8,000 outlined at Investor Day, and we expect a total reduction of 11,000 or so by year-end. Finally before I move on as you are aware JPMorgan and certain others in the financial services industry experienced cyber-attacks this quarter. We are taking every step to protect our customers and our firm, but these attacks highlight the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government to systemically reduce and result cyber threats, we are committed to doing our part. To date we have not observed elevated levels of fraud related to this matter. Turning to Page 5, consumer and business banking. CBB generated net income of $914 million up 20% year-on-year, business continues to improve its operating leverage with an ROE of 33%, up 6 percentage points versus a year ago, with revenue up 5% and expense relatively flat. Underlying business drivers remain strong, average deposits of 476 billion were up 9% year-on-year and client investment assets were up 16% to a record $208 billion. We continued to see strong deposit growth across regions and markets. In fact for the third consecutive year, we led the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth among the largest 50 U.S. banks. Overall, we grew our deposit share in 46 of our 50 largest markets nationwide and we remain number one in three of the largest deposit markets. Moving on to revenue, net interest income was up 4% year-on-year, driven by strong deposit growth offset by continued pressure on margins. And non-interest revenue was up 6%, with investment revenue growth driven by Chase private clients and with the addition of over 700,000 households driving stronger fee income. Expense was relatively flat with efficiency improvement in the business being offset by increased cost of control.  Finally on business banking originations, the momentum that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters continued and we believe we've outperformed the industry with loan originations for the quarter of $1.6 billion up 27% year-on-year, down quarter-on-quarter seasonally. This reflects a combination of industry trends improving driven by business optimism generally continuing to remain strong and improving banking performance, especially in an expansion market as our targeted strategies mature. We do expect the strong growth to continue through the remainder of the year. Mortgage banking on page 6. Overall mortgage banking net income was $439 million for the quarter, with an ROE of 10%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging, mortgage production and pretax income ex-repurchase was slightly positive for the quarter, a little better than guidance on better than expected expense performance. Originations of approximately $21 billion were up 26% quarter-on-quarter against the market that we estimate to be up approximately 10%. Therefore we believe we've gained share and that share gain has been in high quality jumbo and conventional eligible loans which as you know are the segments we are focusing on.  As a remainder with purchase mix up, the business has become much more seasonal with volume and profitability peaks in the second and third quarters and lows in the first and fourth. Given this, we still expect the fourth quarter results to be a small negative as previously guided.  Finally on production we had a $62 million benefit in the quarter driven by refinements to our repurchase reserves. On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of 639 million was down 54 million quarter-on-quarter, a gain on the better side of our guidance, due to gains on the sale of Ginnie Mae loans. Looking forward into the fourth quarter, core servicing revenue will continue to decline and we expect less benefit from other revenue sources such as those from Ginnie Mae sales given lower delinquencies and lower loan modification volume. As a result, we do expect fourth quarter servicing revenue to be $600 million or slightly lower. Servicing expense increased approximately $25 million quarter-on-quarter, due to investments in control and operational improvements. You will note that this represents a delay in achieving our target of $500 million for the fourth quarter. However, we are doing what's necessary to improve our controls and operational processes and we expect servicing expense to continue to decline through 2015 at its lower pace. MSR risk management was a modest gain of 76 million reflecting regular model updates. On real estate portfolios, we added approximately $6.8 billion of high quality loans to our portfolio this quarter up from $5 billion in the second quarter.  Loan quality remains very strong. We've recorded net charge-offs of $81 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio, reflecting improvements in home prices as well as delinquencies. Lastly on mortgage, headcount was down approximately 6,000 year-to-date, meeting our target for the year outlined at Investor Day and we are on track to reduce it by an incremental 1,000 or so by year end. Turning to page seven, Cards, Merchant Services & Auto. Net income of 1.1 billion, down 10% year-on-year but up 4% excluding reserve releases with an ROE of 23%, reflecting very strong spend as well as balanced growth of $3 billion year-over-year continuing the momentum we saw last quarter as growth in our core business is now outpacing the runoff portfolio. Overall, we saw strong and stable revenue of $4.6 billion, flat year-on-year. Loan growth as well as strong sales volume was offset by spread compression and higher amortization of customer acquisition cost. Expenses up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher (floor) [ph] expense related to Home Depot and higher auto lease depreciation. In Card, sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 26th consecutive quarter. This industry outperformance is being driven by the value proposition of our core Chase branded and partner products and the investments we are making in customer acquisition, ultimate rewards, marketing and customer service. These investments are driving strong new account originations, up 29%, and the performance of these new accounts, 2013 and 2014 vintages, is exceeding our expectation. In Merchant Services, volume was up 15% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance. But transaction growth was up 6% year-on-year, lagging sales growth, driven by merchant mix and aggregation trends. In Auto, new vehicle sales continued to grow year-over-year with the third quarter up 8%. We\u2019ve seen the 12th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth despite a very competitive market, and credit losses continued to be stable and low with the Auto pipeline remaining healthy, consistent with the recovery in the auto market. Moving on to credit, the environment remains benign. We continue to see improvements in card early delinquencies, and the card net charge off rate was 252 basis points, an all-time low. This quarter, we released $100 million of auto and student lending reserves with no releases in card.  During September, a new step forward in the evolution of payments was announced, Apple Pay. We are excited to be a key player in a solution that offers improved security and the streamline customer experience. At the same time, we are continuing to develop other innovative payment solutions. Moving on to page eight and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.8 billion and an ROE of 10% or 14% if you adjust the legal expense. In banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year. IB fees were 1.5 billion, up 2%, with revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting fees on strong market activity being offset by lower debt underwriting fees. We maintained our number one ranking in Global IB fees for Dealogic with particular strength in ECM in Europe and IPOs globally and we remain a go-to-bank for large deals and related financing. The IB pipeline is strong with an environment supportive of M&A and a strong equity underwriting market. Treasury services revenue was $1 billion in line with our guidance and lending revenue was down approximately $200 million year-on-year, primarily driven by mark to market losses of over $100 million in this quarter versus modest gains in the prior year on securities received from restructuring. Let\u2019s spend a moment on markets revenue, the green shoot and the potential upside to our performance that we\u2019ve being seeing in early September did in fact materialize and our reported markets revenues were up 1% year-on-year, despite a strong third quarter last year, a quarter in which we significantly outperformed.  In fixed income, in currencies in emerging markets, a strong quarter and a particularly strong September with pick-up in both volumes and volatility as currency markets benefited from divergence across global monetary policies, an average quarter for commodities and credit and an improving quarter for rates. In equities we saw quite strong performance for third quarter in line with last year\u2019s. Cash was very strong in EMEA on the back of a strong primary market and equity derivatives results were lower versus a record last year, offset by an uptick in prime services revenue on higher balances and continued growth. Of note customers are taking notice of the progress we\u2019ve been making in building out our electronic trading platform and we\u2019re seeing strong growth in electronic trading volumes up 50% year-on-year in Europe and nearly 20% in the U.S. Moving on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have completed the sales of our physical commodities business and detailed portfolio, which were major parts of our business simplification agenda and with limited impacts on ROE overtime. However these sales will present revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter and based upon their contributions to last year\u2019s results these will drive an approximately 8% revenue decline year-over-year or approximately $300 million. So outside of the year-over-year decline driven by business exits, we are cautiously optimistic that momentum may carry over. However October so far has been mixed, likely on the back of a changing market sentiment around the prospects of global growth and inflation. Security services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 8% year-on-year primarily driven by high NII on higher deposits down quarter-on-quarter 5% on seasonality. Assets under custody were $21.2 trillion up 8% year-on-year. Credit adjustments and other are positive $240 million is driven primarily by DVA and FDA as a result of credit spread widening and refinements to certain assumptions. Moving on to expense, total expense was up 21% year-on-year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter and year-to-date. Non-comp expense was up 21% year-on-year primarily driven by legal expense but down 2% quarter-on-quarter as increased legal expenses were more than offset by lower cost of business simplification and other expenses. Just quickly on CIB loans, the headline 5% decline for loans is driven by lower client overdraft and trades underlying that traditional credit portfolio and other HFI finance were up by over 10%. Moving on to Page 9 and commercial banking. The quarter saw a net income of $649 million on revenue of 1.7 billion with a strong ROE of 18%. Revenue was down 3% from the prior year and 2% sequentially reflecting yields compression in our lending book as well as business simplification partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Expense of $668 million was in line with guidance and relatively flat year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter despite ongoing investments in control. Loan balances increased 1.6 billion in the quarter driven by continued strong performance in our commercial real-estate businesses. CRE loans increased 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter both in excess of the industry and our CRE book have now grown to 14 consecutive quarters. C&I loans were relatively flat from the prior quarter broadly in line with industry trends. Of note deposits increased to $5 billion in the quarter mostly in middle market and corporate client banking, this is reflective of our clients still managing with very high levels of liquidity. Having said that, utilization rates were up slightly for the quarter and pipelines continued to move incrementally higher across the board. Outside of lending we continued to make good progress in building our core franchise. This quarter growth investment banking revenue was approximately $500 million up 12% from last year and on a year to date basis the commercial bank has generated $1.4 billion of investment banking revenues for the firm, up 22%. Card and merchant services revenue increased 7% from the prior year and finally since this time last year we\u2019ve added approximately 500 new clients in targeted industries. Overall credit performance remains strong with net charge-offs of only one basis point marking the 7th consecutive quarter with net charge-offs in the single-digit or very low or recoveries. As we think about the coming quarter we do expect current trends to continue, we would like to remind you of the one-time proceeds of approximately $100 million that we received in the fourth quarter of last year from a lending related workout. Moving on to Page 10, asset management, an excellent quarter in asset management with record net income of $572 million up 20% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter with a 25% ROE and a 31% pre-tax margin in line with our through-the-cycle targets.  For the full year, we expect these ratios to be below our through-the-cycle targets. You will see that we changed from reporting our revenue by client segment to reporting revenue by line of business to be consistent with how we manage the business. So we are introducing sub line of business results for revenues in global investment management and global wealth management. Overall, revenue was $3 billion was up 9% year-on-year reflecting an increase in management fees driven by long-term net inflows including $16 billion this quarter. This marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 11% year-on-year. While we continue to see strengths in our multi-asset and fixed income flows, equity flows were flat this quarter. Asset management expense of 2.1 billion was up 4% from a year ago and up modestly 1% versus last quarter.  In banking, we reported strong performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances up 16% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter with growth coming from both our U.S. and our international markets and a solid pipeline for demand for the remainder of the year. Deposits were also a record up 9% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter.  Lastly as reported, client assets of 2.3 trillion were up 4% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter. However as part of business simplification, we closed the sale of the RPS business during this quarter, recognizing a small gain reflected in GIM. Excluding the impact of the RPS sale, client assets would have been up 10% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter.  Moving on to page 11 on corporate and private equity. Private equity reported $71 million of net income driven by net valuation gains including a small net gain related to the portfolio sale in OEP which we announced in the quarter, predominantly offset by related expenses. Year-to-date the portfolio balance is down by approximately $2.5 billion and with this sale we expect it to be down by about $4 billion by year end. Treasury and CIO reported a small net loss of $30 million with NII slightly positive in the quarter. And other corporate net income at $357 million included in this result were tax related benefits of approximately $400 million as I previously mentioned as well as approximately $500 million pre-tax of legal expense with the remainder of the firm-wide legal expense principally in the IB. At the firm level our tax rate for the quarter was 28% broadly in line with a normalized tax rate of 30% plus or minus. Non-deductible legal expenses in CIB were offset by tax benefits here and other corporate.  Before moving onto our outlook page, Firm NII was up approximately $320 million quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower interest expense in CIB and core NII was up approximately $110 million.  Moving onto page 12, you can see on the page our current outlook which I've already addressed throughout the presentation. So wrapping up, a strong result for the third quarter despite legal expense of $1 billion after tax. This reflects the strength of each of our franchises and the benefits of the diversified business model. We have made substantial progress against our control and regulatory agenda as well as business simplification albeit with more work to do and we have successfully executed against our 2014 target for capital leverage and liquidity. As I've shown you today, the investments we are making in our businesses are fueling growth and underpinning strong earnings now and in the future and we remain focused on serving our customers and safeguarding their assets and our company.  With that operator, please open up the lines for Q&A. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank :  Can you just give us a sense of what's left in terms of simplifying the model, maybe split up between the CIB and consumers if that's a good way of approaching it? Marianne Lake :  Yes, I mean -- I would say we -- I think I can\u2019t remember which quarter it was, but several quarters ago, we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what the business -- it was last year showed what the business simplification agenda looked like. I think if you go back and now look at what we\u2019ve done including what we were able to either complete or sign this quarter OEP, and the RPS business, GSOG, commodities, we\u2019ve certainly broken the back of most of the business simplification agenda. Having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to de-risk clients and industries and continue to simplify our products in mortgage and the like. So I would characterize that the actions that we\u2019ve taken by the end of this year are substantially all of them but at the margin we continue to look client by client, product by product to simplify things. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, now as a follow up somewhat related as we think about having more clarity on the capital rules and specifically the supplementary leverage ratio as well as the LCR. Is there some opportunity for optimization of the balance sheet now that you have more clarity on those rules? Marianne Lake : So, we\u2019ve talked before about the fact that when you take into consideration the combination of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the company for rising rates so therefore our own point of view of being under invested in a duration perspective that we have we believe a relatively optimized balance sheet. Although it looks like we have a significant amount of cash that is in part non-operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return and in other parts is part of our overall liquidity. I mentioned that subsequent to the U.S. LCR rules being made final, that although we have been reporting previously against Basel our compliance in the 20 plus percent range so a buffer of 20 plus percent. The U.S. rules are more punitive in a number of ways, most notably that they look at peak outflows in 30 days rather than cumulative and also on higher outflow assumptions across certain categories given that we are now compliant with a more modest buffer. So we would say that we are largely optimized. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, and then just lastly, the 300 million of revenue going away in the fourth quarter, what would be the expenses and capital against that? Marianne Lake : So, the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall firm so while it obviously is positive for us if not a noteworthy number. And the expenses just to note that I said the ROE is limited over time this is a business that was still being built and therefore haven\u2019t yet reached the maturity stage or a stage where it was returning its hurdle. It will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out so there will be a slight lag in removing expenses. So in the fourth quarter it will be more modest, but over time it would be a large chunk of that $300 million. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could give us some broader context on the core expenses, is the principle driver of the updated outlook around the 58 billion, is that just comp and can you remind us where you are on the compliance control expenses in terms of leveling off there? Marianne Lake : Yes, so, look we had a better third quarter than we have been expecting earlier in the quarter. We\u2019ll see how the fourth quarter pans out. So, yes it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger second half of the year that our expectations for comp will be higher. They\u2019ll still be well within our comp to revenue ratio range of 30% to 35% and you saw for the quarter 32% year-to-date the same. So, in large part it\u2019s going to be based on higher revenues in market. This quarter we also had higher revenues in mortgage and also in corporate, so that is the principle driver. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : And as we look out further to \u201915 and \u201916, could you give us a reminder of where you\u2019re looking to reduce the core expense base and get some savings on one or two year basis? Marianne Lake : Yes, before I do that you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls, let me just deal with that very quickly. We talked about the fact that we expect our control cost to reach a peak this year, that\u2019s still the case. So, I would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year. They will over time be able to come down and they\u2019ll still remain elevated relative to historical because of the new business world we\u2019re in. But we\u2019re going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look back, so over time that will provide leverage. In terms of looking out to 2015 and \u201916, while we haven\u2019t given specific guidance I\u2019ll just point you to a few things; the first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit trends. We would also expect to see improvements in the production space, there is a reasonable fixed cost base and nevertheless as you saw this quarter we\u2019ve continued to make great progress in residing that expense base. In the non-mortgage space in the consumer bank Gordon has committed to a $1 billion in \u201816 over \u201814 principally but not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint optimization. And then while we didn\u2019t quantify it, Daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the CIB. So I would say across the board and obviously we\u2019re growing in asset management, we\u2019re investing in our businesses notwithstanding. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : And then on the legal expense, did you give any color in the beginning on what was that for this quarter and in terms of the FX and LIBOR investigations, are those at the stage that where reserves can be built or can you offer anything on that? Marianne Lake : At the beginning what I did say is that there are a number of matters in our legal expenses for the quarter but in large part it does relate to FX and consequently you can read into that the things are further progressed this quarter than last but obviously we can\u2019t comment any further. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : And then just in terms of share buybacks and capital levels, I was wondering about your thoughts on the prospects for higher G-SIB buffers in the U.S. and how are you going to balance in the near term your growing your risk based capitals against executing the remaining buyback authorization that you have. Marianne Lake : Just to talk about, so we did $1.5 billion of buyback this quarter same last quarter, obviously we have another two to go in terms of our approval. We don\u2019t know what the rule is going to be, it\u2019ll come out before the end of the year, we\u2019ll have to see what that says. There will be a transition timeline, it will transition on the same timeline phase in timeline that the rest of the buffer is transitioning on through to the 1 of January 2019. So there is no need for us to overreact and rate the compliance, so we would do much as we have done over the course of the last two years which is balance continuing to make good progress, getting to wherever it is that we need to be which we\u2019re not going to get at this moment against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases. Jamie Dimon : And remember you all have forecast where our CET 1 goes up to 10.5 or 10.8 or something like that, when the new CCAR rules come out we\u2019ll probably be able to fine tune where it might look like at the end of 2015. Marianne Lake : I mean the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1% wearing good company with the rest of the industry in the context that just given how CCAR operates, its highly likely that there will be overall accretion to capital in the industry over the course of 2015 and we\u2019ll be no exception. So we will continue to accrete capital up towards and potentially above our 10.5. But we\u2019re not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules. One thing on the target, just when you see the rules yourself know that in our 50 to 100 basis points buffer the reason why we had a range was to allow in part to some of uncertainty and things evolving and so we would obviously want to fine tune and put a finer point a point on our buffer. So it\u2019s possible that a buffer may not be as high as 100% too. So we\u2019ll deal will all of that when the rules come out. Jamie Dimon : And we\u2019ve also been remember very careful, the purpose here to protect and grow the client franchise, meet the regulatory agenda and then we\u2019ll adjust to all these changes as they take place, the big ones we\u2019re go to know by the end of the year. John McDonald - Stanford Bernstein : And Marianne just on that point, you had some RWA inflation in the first half as you waited some model approvals you are waiting for I believe. Where are you on those model approvals and your expectations for kind of the ratio of risk weighted assets the total assets as we move forward? Marianne Lake : So you would have seen our other where it came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter on the back of model improvements and on later on portfolio run-off. So we\u2019re starting to see that bend now. It is the case that as we project forward to the end of 2015, that\u2019s the number that we showed you at Investor Day is still relatively good, it\u2019s probably a little higher than that, we said 1.5 it will be somewhere between 1.5 and 1.55 by the end of next year. We\u2019re not in complete control around the timing of model approvals, we\u2019re obviously doing everything we can to be timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them. So we kind of been a little bit more conservative potentially about the duration it takes to get models approved, but we\u2019re still on that same basic trajectory. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI:  So first question on -- deposit growth has been growth and I guess I would love to see higher rates in loan growth. But you are positively positioned for the parallel shift up. I guess my first question is how does that change in more of a flattening environment that we are experiencing right now? Do you capture most of the benefit anyway just getting off zero on the short end? Marianne Lake : Yes, I mean -- yes there is a significant benefit. If you look at our disclosures, you can kind of see the short-end versus long-end impact. Basically there is a significant benefit coming up off the short-end that we would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months but we are obviously are looking for a more normal curve overall overtime. Glenn Schorr - ISI:  Okay. Just -- I know we are not supposed to read too much into it, but in everyone's mid-cycle (DFAST) [ph] results I think everyone was calling for -- or the big banks were calling for higher losses and lower PPNR in general relative to your own self-test from the previous year. Is that conservatism? Because it is a little different relative to the commentary about an improving economy, a little bit better loan growth, good expense control, things like that. I'm just curious what we are supposed to take away from that mid-cycle. Marianne Lake :  So obviously not to comment on everybody else's results but our results were in terms of the size of the economic downturn they were relatively in line and our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort of enhancements to our process. So we weren't actually looking for materially changed results in our mid-year (DEPAST) [ph]. So obviously we haven't had instructions yet, we are expecting them absolutely eminently possibly as early as this week in terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding company scenario for 2015 CCAR to the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses or stresses on leverage or other things, it could have an impact but we have to wait and see. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay, okay, last one. There are a couple of articles on rewriting of banker's agreements between major dealers to resolve some of the early termination rights issues, which obviously is going towards the Fed's issues on living wills. A, did that actually happen or is that just being talked about? And B, does it resolve the issue in the Fed's -- I know you can't speak for the Fed, but does it resolve the issue or do you still have the client side to deal with over time? Jamie Dimon : So Mark Carney of the FSB and the Bank of England, Chairman said that two major things remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. One is the how you deal with derivatives and the second is TLAC and that both of those would be done this year. This is the thing has been done, it's a great example, I think it was 18 firms who got together and came up in a very complex way globally how to deal with this in a way that the regulators and the Fed put out a press release and Mark Carney has been positive about it and it was industry led. So we do think it does solve that issue. So all the buy cycles do it. It will be eventually all the sales side I mean the other way around, all the buy side will eventually want to do it because it\u2019s actually better for the business as a whole, maybe not better for one trading desk but it's better for the business as a whole and it's a little coercive. So that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives you're going to have to adopt these new rules and we think over time a lot of you will do it. Marianne Lake : And just one thing that the G18 does put a break to the back of the problem and but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. So there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader if nothing else for simplicity purposes not necessarily because the G18 alone don't really achieve the result. : And just one thing that the G18 does put a break to the back of the problem and but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. So there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader if nothing else for simplicity purposes not necessarily because the G18 alone don't really achieve the result. Jamie Dimon : And we were also in a position where even if the buy side doesn't for some reason that we would be able to manage that risk overtime and it would diminish overtime because in the short duration of the derivatives. Glenn Schorr - ISI:  Right. And as long as the Fed counts that as \u201cmaterial progress by July of '15\u201d, I am cool with it too. Thanks. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley :  Hey, a couple of questions. One is on just RWAs in general. There were some articles around potentially shifting some of the repo activity to more of an agent role and principal role. I don't know if that's one of the ways that you could potentially have a light impact maybe on RWAs but on total footings to help with the ratios. Is that something that's being considered? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I mean our repo business is as you know substantially client driven and our clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallet to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance sheet to their business. So in that sense we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our clients and as cash resource quite frankly. So, it is obviously the case that as we understand any rules but meanwhile leverage rules have been out for a while and we\u2019ve seen leverage reducing the industry overall but we continue to have a strong and healthy repo business. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And would you be supportive of an industry move towards shifting repo to more of a CCP environment or no? Jamie Dimon : We\u2019re okay with the higher margin that's generated margin rules and if they go to kind of a tri-party CCP they\u2019ll be fine too and it would elevate other issues at that point in time. Marianne Lake : I mean between the CCP and I think that FSC even put out a framework last night that talked about cross industry including non-financials standardized higher levels of haircut that we are supportive of. So, I think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s great. I asked the question in part because as people are concerned about things like the SIFI buffer increasing and other regulatory capital requirements. I am just trying to tease out what other options you have to your client facing business but yet maybe shrink the footings in a way that deal with these ratios without having to \u201cbreak up the bank\u201d? Marianne Lake : So, I mean I think that we would do exactly with this what we\u2019ve done with everything else to-date which is overall we\u2019re only going to put our balance sheet to and allow our clients to use it if the overall relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that. We have the ability to do that somewhat methodically and so we\u2019re being very surgical and very strategic about how we use our balance sheet. But it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able to do that. So, yes, we could. I mean if you look at the numbers, however, you want to cut them. There is within our repo business we do have a match book. We have inventory financing as well. We have clients. We\u2019ve seen our short term wholesale funding so there are things we could do. We just don\u2019t want to overreact. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks. And then just separately on the payments discussion. In your prepared remarks, Marianne, you highlighted that you are delighted to work with Apple Pay but that you are also working on some other things yourself. Could you speak to what other things you are doing independently? Marianne Lake : So, I mean we talked before and you will see more over the coming few months about our own wallet and payments capability. So take Chase Pay and Quick Checkout where we would provide the capability for our customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rates and continuing with the safety and security tokenization and other methods. So we\u2019re continuing to work on our own proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the next coming months. And then there's obviously the case that we are out to pilot and in production on our end to end capability including Chase Net. So we\u2019re signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and again you will hear more about that later. But our ability to now negotiate bilaterally economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons to continue to bring share to us is also something we\u2019re working on. Jamie Dimon : Our basic philosophy has been that you the customer who want to be able to use your debit cards, your credits in a way that you want and then we want to make it available to you whether its Apple Pay, in-store apps other people\u2019s wallets, these are wallet, our own -- all of which will have benefits et cetera. And as Marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified contracts. So we\u2019re trying to make this an ecosystem works better for everybody and is far more secure, higher customers on both sides and far more secure. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And I think is it accurate I mean that you mentioned at a recent conference that you were looking to double the spend in cyber security, is that right? Jamie Dimon : Yes, I was just estimating if I was taking a guess that it will double over the next four or five years. Marianne Lake : I mean I think it\u2019s fair to say that what we\u2019re seeing in the cyber space not surprisingly is this relentless constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in response, so it\u2019s entirely reasonable to assume that we\u2019ll continue to increase our investments over the course of the next several years and we\u2019ll -- so it will be larger our we\u2019ll let you know. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019d like to clarify that quoted in the press not accurately because this is one area where the government and businesses have been collaborating really well. And for a long time is because all these government agencies and I think we need that because the government sees all kind of attacks and they have a fountain of information. And then also industry self-collaborates which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see something happening, so maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that. And then cyber goes beyond just yourself, its making sure that all your vendors you deal with have proper cyber controls, that all the exchanges have proper cyber controls. So this is -- we\u2019ve identified this as a huge effort, we\u2019ve been very good at it, the most recent breach which we\u2019re not going to make excuses for. We\u2019ll invest any and all things we just do to get it right. Our customers are protected which is critical but we don\u2019t want these things to be happening. But it\u2019s going to be a battle, you\u2019ve already seen a lot of very, very serious far more serious than personal data being taken, where social security numbers, security codes, account numbers et cetera. And we do think that unfortunately there are going to be some wins and losses in this. This is not going to be one of those things where it\u2019s going to be absolute and we don\u2019t want to be sitting here saying you can absolutely be protected because we think that will put you in a false sense of security. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And those are all great points, I mean you could imagine tokenization moving beyond just payments to any interface with clients at some point? Jamie Dimon : Yes, tokenization can be more broadly used and that\u2019s avoided a certain type of fraud but not other type of frauds. So you have to look at each one of these things and say what does it accomplish? Marianne Lake : And that certainly helps across the payments phase, but there are other areas of vulnerability obviously. Jamie Dimon : And [indiscernible] security about who came to what systems, when they use private computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. There are all these things we are all doing and we\u2019ve had some great people come in audit us and this is one area I suggest to most companies, get someone to come who in as an expert at this. . We have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get through, so we\u2019re always trying to look where we might have a weak spot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous:  I just wanted to follow-up first of all on the question that Glenn asked about the change in the derivatives contracts. From your perspective doesn't this fundamentally render the contract less attractive for users because of the loss of the automatic bankruptcy preference? And if so, would you expect that this is one more potential pressure on the derivatives revenues that you've talked about in the past potentially depressing your revenues by as much as $1 billion? Jamie Dimon : : I don\u2019t think it makes it less attractive, for the one reason if you look at one contract that someone may have in one fund or something like that, it may make it slightly less attractive. But if you looked at the improved safety of the system I think it makes it more attractive. So people believe that doing this makes the whole system safer, every institution say while on the one contract side I will prefer to have the optimality but for the total I\u2019d like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all those out. If the resolution works that is really, really good for everybody. I mean everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for Lehman. The pain and suffering would have been far less across derivatives even though they didn\u2019t have the same -- they had more protection derivatives at the time. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous: And while we are on that topic then, another thing that happened during the quarter obviously was the Fed and FDIC rejecting the living wills. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what changes that might have provoked from your point of view in terms of accelerating some of the simplifications that you were talking about earlier? Marianne Lake : So I think just an important point of clarification for what its worth is the that the FDIC found the industry\u2019s 2013 plans not credible and the Fed did not. So it wasn\u2019t a joint agency conclusion at that point. And so we haven\u2019t had to comment on the 2014 plan yet. Having said that we talking to JPMorgan, we made substantial progress even between the '13 and '14 submissions, we\u2019re in dialogs with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plans, we\u2019re committed to remediation in by 2015. It has had little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda but we continue to work on all number of things around the place, critical operations, legal entities, simplification and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Jamie Dimon : : Remember the FSB led by Mark Carney has made it -- they have said publically that the two big remaining pieces are TLAC, which should be done this year, and the derivatives stay, that would be common harmonization around the globe and those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more achievable. Marianne Lake :  And we should add that obviously there is a protocol was specifically pointed out in that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolves that issue I think very well. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous: Yes, fair enough. I mean I think a lot of times the press reports forget to pull together all the pieces like that. I hate to beat the regulatory horse too hard here, but one of the things that we were hearing towards the end of the quarter was that our clients were telling us that they were seeing a significant fall off in liquidity in some aspects of the credit markets in particular. And I was wondering, is there any link between that and some of the new filings that you\u2019ve had to start doing on a daily basis for -- not just you, but obviously all the dealers on liquidity? And I think some of the Volcker data gathering has started as well. And I was wondering if there was any linkage there? Marianne Lake :  No. So I mean my point of view on this is that while we have started doing a filing more recently we've been well aware of the requirements for a reasonably long if not very long period of time and have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirement. So the fact that we are producing metrics at this point isn't having meaningful impact on our business. It is the case that we know over the course of the next year between now and the compliance date next July, we do expect to as an industry receive feedback on that data and we\u2019ll have to see how that progresses but it's our point of view that our business is compliant. Jamie Dimon : Industry wide as people push LCR and capital and some of these rules down to the trading desk that you did see a reduction in inventories et cetera, but our view is that market making is a critical role in society and it has to take place, we have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients and we've electrified more of it, some of them will go to clearing houses, some of it would be -- but we want to be there for the clients and we will see how the industry sorts out. Some people in the industry are making much more drastic decisions than others. And our decision has been to be there, to make markets. And just try to adjust the new rules which may make it a little bit more costly to trade. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous:  But what I think I hear you saying is that the recent imposition of some of these reporting requirements did not in itself have those liquidity impact? Jamie Dimon : I think it wasn't the report reporting requirements, I think it was pushing down at LCR, the cost of capital, the cost of debt and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit and they were a little more cautious how to use balance sheet. And that's industry wide. And then some people said we simply can\u2019t stay in these areas. I've seen people exit certain trading areas. Marianne Lake :  Yes, I mean repo is a good example of that where the level of not concerned but the level of dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased because others are less willing. And so we are seeing some of that visual. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous:  Got it. And then the last one for me, Marianne, you gave some clarification around loan growth in the CIB. But I am not sure I quite understood it. Basically you said the minus 5% headline number was affected by a couple of it sounded like one time-ish kind of things and what the underlying was. But as I said, I'm not sure I really caught your drift. Marianne Lake :  Okay. So let me give you the down piece of it. One of them is not timing, it's just the continuation of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year-over-year. And so when you look at the overall loan balance is being impacted by trade markedly. And then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit lumpier obviously. So those two things are driving it down. But the point to the comment was a little bit not trivialized reported loan growth which was still positive but with those masking underlying performance in our credit portfolio in HFI loans. So our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : Can you share with us -- obviously the Federal Reserve is asking for more capital for all the larger global SIFI type banks. What's the minimum cushion would you guys be comfortable running against? You mentioned your 50 to 100 basis points might be a little less. How low would you go in your cushion for meeting those new capital guidelines when they come out down the road? Marianne Lake :  So I think -- look a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of that range, at the 50 basis point. So remember when we -- obviously we\u2019ll refine it and would update you but when we have thoughts about having a buffer, it\u2019s been, it is there in order to protect us from range of issues including capital volatility driven by AOCI we regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in AOCI in a short period of time and that\u2019s going to be one of the principle drivers. So I would say that\u2019s the reasonable benchmark for the level that we would go to. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to have that buffer in totality. As I said, buffers phase in between now and January of 2019. So whatever we decided it, however we communicate that to you, that as well as all of the other buffers capital conservation buffer and G-SIB will phase in. Jamie Dimon : And CCAR may still be a limiting factor, so\u2026 Marianne Lake : As Jamie said the reality is that the why CCAR is operating while there has been good progress in the communication and dialog with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear either quantitatively or qualitatively exactly how everything is working and therefore its unlikely to be the case that in this cycle that you\u2019re going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution, that\u2019s my view. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : Yes. No, regarding the return on equity, at Investor Day you guys gave us the through the cycle target of 15% to 16%. Clearly I would assume that in this year's Investor Day when it comes up, if these capital levels are even higher now than what you originally thought when you gave that guidance, it probably will be a bit lower. What lines of business do you think will see the lower ROE targets, if you decide that you need to lower it through the cycle from the 15% to 16% that you gave us last year? Marianne Lake : So I mean just before we sort of get onto the business by business lens on it, I mean the reality mathematically is obviously true that if we have higher capital we would prima facie defacto have lower returns. But the reality hasn\u2019t been that way over time. So, you know acutely that we\u2019ve added significant capital over the last, however, many years. And have been able to over time continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to deliver strong returns. So could there be a decline in returns, we will obviously have to see what the rules look like. Clearly, at the moment, the most clear and present danger relates to higher G-SIB surcharges on short term wholesale funding. So in the first order impact of it would obviously have an impact on directly those businesses and products in the CIB but obviously if the company is holding more capital we\u2019ll look more broadly. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that you\u2019re going to see a pro-rata decline in our returns and obviously we are continuing to focus on our expenses and making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : Is it fair to say that today\u2019s ROE in today\u2019s quarter of about 10%, which obviously is below your through the cycle number. Is it primarily an interest rate issue that\u2019s holding it back or is there some other issue, the high elevated expenses that you\u2019re running due to all the new regulations and stuff? Marianne Lake : So I mean 10s in ROE, 13% ROTCE remember the target is an ROTCE target. It\u2019s obviously right now in 2014 we\u2019re in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways, and elevated expenses. So, it\u2019s cyclical lows in mortgage at least for the first half of the year cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the market space. Yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses so that is in part contributing reserve releases are low a little bit, the credit remains benign but as a relative matter they\u2019re lower. But we are staring efficiencies in the face across our businesses over the course of the next two years. So, control costs will decline, CCP will deliver improvements in expense, CIB will also. Rates will be a meaningful piece. Clearly, you\u2019ve seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant, but it\u2019s not the only piece. When the economy generally recovers when loan growth recovers and volatility recovers, all those things, good things happen. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : Shifting gears, if we look at leverage lending the Federal Reserve has come out recently concerned about some of the underwriting that's going on there. And I think they even pointed out that leverage lending now will be used in the CCAR possibly from a qualitative standpoint. Can you guys give us any color on what your understanding is of what is going on with leverage lending today? And will it be included in CCAR? Marianne Lake : So just to talk about what will included in CCAR, the truth is we don\u2019t know. So, what you have seen we have also read but that doesn\u2019t constitute any kind of guidance, we haven\u2019t received guidance yet. So we\u2019re going to have to wait to see that. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprising if there were some sort of leverage stress in that quantitatively, I can\u2019t see to qualitatively. And then yes there have been more stringent guidance on leverage lending from the regulators over the course of the last year. And we\u2019ve taken a fairly strict line on applying that. So it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen. Jamie Dimon : : It\u2019s going to get a little stricter in the refi part of the leverage loans, and obviously whatever the terms are we will meet the terms and some of that business will go to non-banks, some banks who are not regulated by the OCC and the Fed. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : You guys gave us some very good numbers on the mobile approximately usage by your customers. What\u2019s the penetration rate of your customer base that uses that mobile app? Marianne Lake : I mean it\u2019s still relative to 20 something million customers in household in the 23 something like that million households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. And from recollection we\u2019ll check the numbers for you I think is in that 2 million to 3 million range, but nevertheless\u2026 Jamie Dimon : : Mobile is much higher than that. Marianne Lake : Mobile is higher, okay. We\u2019ll get back to you. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : And then finally you guys talked about Apple Pay\u2026 Marianne Lake : It\u2019s 18 million. Jamie Dimon : : Its 18, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s individuals or households, it\u2019s a huge amount. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : You guys mentioned the Apple Pay and the opportunities there. What are some of the business -- where can you see the growth but at the same time where can Apple Pay cannibalize some of your businesses or are there any that would be cannibalized? Jamie Dimon : : Look again our view is to -- if you\u2019re a client and you want to use your Apple Phone to pay with NFC at a merchant, that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t want to say you can\u2019t use your JPMorgan Chase credit card or debit card. And like we said we\u2019re going to be in other people\u2019s wallets too and we\u2019re going to have our own which we think will have some competitive advantage. So will it cannibalize? Sure, but we\u2019re not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we\u2019re building a better business and are gaining share. Certainly our goal is to gain share. We do believe a little bit and you know when Jeff Bezos says your margin is my opportunity, we want to be the people that come with new ideas and stuff that are getting more of our customers using our stuff and happier. And if reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  A follow-up on the loan question from before. You mentioned a little bit more caution with leverage loans. In the past you said you didn't want to compete too much in the commercial space if it's getting too competitive. There's been some current concerns about auto lending with regulators. So my question is, slide 1 highlights that your core loans are up 1% quarter over quarter and the same slide in the second quarter said that core loans were up 4% quarter over quarter. So my question is, are you simply getting more cautious in the loans that you provide or is there a little bit less demand in the market? Really trying to get to is loan growth decelerating? Marianne Lake : I mean if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in there, I mean I think the first quarter year-over-year was 4%, 8% in the second quarter and 7% in the third quarter. I think we\u2019re not expecting those year-over-year trends to be decelerate, obviously quarter-over-quarter things can be impacted just by the timing of closing loans. So fundamentally I would say no we aren\u2019t seeing significant deceleration quarter-over-quarter within continued relative momentum solid across the board with obviously more challenges in the C&I space. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Separately your expense guidance is now for over $58 billion, you said some of that\u2019s due to comp. Is any of that increase in guidance due not to comp? Marianne Lake : Relative through the $58 plus or minus that we previously said, no it\u2019s principally in high revenues or higher market performance. Jamie Dimon : : And we always said that might be the case. So we\u2019re meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself is bouncing around a little bit. Remember in the old days we used to break out IB comp in total for that reason. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Separately which capital ratio is your binding constraint? And using that ratio, what should we use in our model three years out? And I know that's a tough question with all the moving parts, but what's your best guess? Marianne Lake : So just in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is CET 1, so Basel III advanced capital and risk based capital at the margin, so it\u2019s not to say that the other ratios leverage liquidity and the like aren't comfortably around it and even stress capital. But that is currently our binding constraints. It\u2019s very hard for us to give you a point of view of where you should do this in your model three years out when we\u2019re staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. As I said earlier we are expecting over the course of the next 12 months that we\u2019ll continue to accrete capital at to or above our 10.5% which is basically in line with what you guys all have in your models. Beyond that, it\u2019s our expectation that hopefully anyway putting new rules aside that by the time we are in our fourth or fifth cycle of CCAR we have made substantial industry-wide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of CCAR where we have more credible resolution and the like that we will be able to be more aggressive in our ability to seek capital distribution capability. So outside of any changes in rules we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016 CCAR to be able to have payout ratios are much higher, but we will have to see. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  Okay. And then last question on the supplement page six, this is a smaller item but it just kind of stands out. Your rate on trading liabilities declined from 48 basis points down to 12 basis points in just three months. Is there anything unusual there? Marianne Lake :  Yes, there is. So about half of that I would call -- approximately half of that I would call relatively normal but included in that result there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for a previous interest accrual that we released in the quarter which is one time you should expect that interest expense to go back up next quarter is something more normal. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA:  And how much, what was the dollar amount of that impact? Marianne Lake :  A little less than $100 million. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Just wanted to follow up with two quick questions. The first is, Marianne, if we put together everything that you have said on expenses so far in this call, is it fair to assume that without rates the adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% can continue to improve in 2015 and 2016? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I think \u2013 yes it is, it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be able to improving overtime ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid-50s, so that is dependent on revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates. So in the absence of rates, but by the way just to point out, that is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic economy the rates will start to rise in the middle of next year. But having said that even without rates we would hope to be able to continue to maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And the second follow-up question is, given your expectations for rates to rise in the middle of next year are you still -- and the progress that you -- continued progress you make on deposit share are you still expecting $100 billion in deposit outflows in that case? Marianne Lake :  So since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with liquidity draining out in the system, remember that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the Fed would use the reverse repo program in much more size and is likely to be the case today for two reasons. One is that obviously they've made changes to the term deposit that allows them to now be LCR eligible which is helpful in terms of providing another tool in that toolkit and the second is that in September as you know the RRP was capped in total at $300 billion. That cap may or may not be permanent I am sure it will be recalibrated over time but it looks like it will be unlikely to reach the $1 billion that would have driven the $100 billion, so at $1 trillion that would have driven a 100 billion. So you can make your decision about whether its $300 million or $500 million in the foremost of time and scale our operating deposit outflows back relative to that knowing of course that it's already in operation at $300 billion right now. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS :  So, appreciate that the repo book is substantially client driven. Was maybe hoping that you guys could give us some sense for how much of your repo book is firm financing versus facilitation? Marianne Lake :  Brennan, we haven't disclosed that. A large chunk of it is client driven, that's what we will say. Brennan Hawken - UBS : Okay. Worth a shot. Marianne Lake :  The larger chunk of it, the larger chunk of it. Jamie Dimon : We've also lengthened the firm financing part of it. Marianne Lake :  Yes. Jamie Dimon : To be more compliant with LCR et cetera. Marianne Lake :  Right. Brennan Hawken - UBS : Okay, that is fair. And I just wanted to try to square something here and maybe I am reading just a little too much into it. You had said that October on the capital markets side has been a bit mixed. But you have also at the same time brought up your expense guidance and it seems like its driven by expected or potentially a component of comp and capital markets. So are those two at odds? Are you just more optimistic that maybe what we're seeing here in October is not necessarily some sort of dramatic shift but a temporary bout in bad volatility? Or how can we square those two? Marianne Lake : So, I would square in to it, the first is we already did have a better performance in the third quarter than would have been anticipated in our previous guidance given that that guidance was given during the sort of harder times of the second quarter. So that\u2019s already in our run rate so to speak in terms of the comp that would accrue to that. And then if you sort of go back and in the form of the time look at the trends because I did say if the performance continues into the fourth quarter. So it will depend. We\u2019ve always said and evidently maybe we should strip out comp from our adjusted expenses. But we\u2019ve always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously going to be calibrated to the performance of the market related businesses. And clearly, you would wave in good revenues every day at 32% comp to revenue ratio. So that\u2019s really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that. Brennan Hawken - UBS : And then appreciate that there is not much color potentially to be added on this charge tied to FX. But just is it possible to let us know if it\u2019s tied to a particular geography? Marianne Lake : No, it\u2019s not possible to talk about anything more detail I am afraid. Suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of jurisdictions. Brennan Hawken - UBS : All right, that is fair. And then last one for me. So in looking at the NIM simulation that you guys have provided, and then taking a look at that in light of the interest rate shock disclosures you've got in your Q's, it looks like a 200 basis point rate shock adds about half of what you are looking for in a normalized rate environment. So I guess does that mean that subsequent years sort of the benefit of rolling the portfolio into higher rates is going to exceed the higher deposit cost by about $4 billion to $5 billion? And is there a particular time period that we should think about that or is it going to be too heavily influenced by competitive dynamics? Marianne Lake : So you are right that when you roll forward during the first 12 months you do get the benefit of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their underlying investments. So that is the compounding effect of what you\u2019re seeing in our earnings and risk shock. But what we showed I think and I am going to cease to recall it but maybe it was in the Barclays conference in 2013 is that you would expect once rates start to rise if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion so obviously it depends on what rate cost you want to put on that that you could expect the accumulative NII to be in our impact in three to four years. Jamie Dimon : And remember the benefit is more for the first 100 a little bit less to the second 100, a little bit less to the third 100, a little bit less to 400 because there is increasing re-pricing of deposits at that level. And we don\u2019t know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out. And also we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and re-pricing. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s a very good point actually Brennan. All scenario does contemplate not only a more normal loan to deposit ratio, more normal interest bearing versus non-interest bearing deposit and also a higher feature on retail deposits just given the LCR competitive dynamics, the technology advancements and the like. So, to the best of our ability we\u2019ve tried to bake that in and that\u2019s included in our number. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Just a tactical follow-up just on the balance sheet. With the non-interest-bearing deposits basically being the fastest growing category of the balance sheet and the resulting asset, the deposit with banks also being the fastest-growing asset on the balance sheet. Just within that context of what you just walked through with Brennan, I am just wondering what changes structurally with the way you think about reinvesting in the securities portfolio with rates as low as they are now. Loan growth is okay, but to your point you are being somewhat selective on -- and want to be careful with pricing and credit. So, just from a -- more so taking the next year or so out, how are your thoughts changing at all with respect to what you do with these deposits given that they might actually not flow out as much given that change to the RRP function? Marianne Lake : So the deposits there were -- so in part not totality, in part the deposits that were likely to outflow through the RRP were non-operating deposits. And non-operating deposits we do not count for significant liquidity value in the firm we fundamentally has an on deposit at central banks at the Fed and so if they stay so we\u2019ll come back to whether we would be willing to let them stay, but if they stay they will continue to basically be treated in that way and they are not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward looking NII.  Obviously over time we are in the same ways we talked about repo, we are looking at non-operating deposits for our client in the context of their overall relationship and so that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with leverage capital alike against it and in the fullness of time we\u2019ll expect the overall relationship to pay for that, but we are going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out.  So other than that, I will just go back to the earlier comment I made that we do have a high level of HQLA and not in cap nor in securities but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most importantly but also under LCR and NSFR and we feel good and add modest buffers relative to them. Jamie Dimon : In the typical quarter end, we have a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are not necessarily good for us in terms of LCR or capital etcetera and we will be looking at how we manage those client relations overtime too. The other thing I remember is securities portfolio is as rates go up the duration of that extends on its own. Marianne Lake :  Correct. Jamie Dimon : And so we will be managing that and yes we might invest more than 1 point but we are in a very conservative position right now. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Yes, okay. Got it. And then secondly, just two quick ones on mortgage. Default servicing costs have pretty much stabilized the last couple of quarters at a good level that you had talked about getting down to $500 million total by the fourth. And I am just wondering how much more room is there given that improvement in underlying trends that you're continuing to see for that to be a benefit to that cost side of the equation going forward? Marianne Lake :  So we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down, modification pipelines, all the metrics are coming down, obviously they are coming down from a much smaller place this year than they were last and the year before. So the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower but we are expecting that to continue down through 500s and into the 400s in 2015. And then just more longer term, you know that we are focused on ensuring that through the next cycle we have a smaller delinquency portfolio and so a more normal level would be substantially less than this. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Okay. And I noticed that your [multiple speakers]. Marianne Lake :  Sorry, that's a longer term view. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company: Yes. And I noticed also that underneath the origination improvement this quarter, there was a decent jump in correspondent. I am just not -- I just wanted to ask if you are doing anything differently in terms of market share opportunities on the mortgage side now that things have shaken out a little bit or any change in your underlying philosophy on where you are looking at originations? Marianne Lake :  Yes, so I mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had loss share a combination of things primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in what I would call in our target segment. So we've made that back. So in some part it's just continuing to leverage our balance sheet properly due very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating processes. So across the board, we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Steve Chubak - Nomura: Marianne, I appreciated the color you had given on the RWA guidance. I suppose one thing that we have been hearing from a lot of clients, or at least concern from clients, is this notion of regulatory gold plating, essentially the US regulators adopting tougher standards than those that are being enforced in other areas around the globe. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how that's informing your thinking about RWA mitigation plans. You reaffirmed the guidance at Investor Day, but what should we expect in the event that a tougher capital as well as TLAC requirement is in fact enforced against US G-SIBs? Marianne Lake : So just to be very clear, maybe it's actually slightly higher than Investor Day in terms of our guidance. So look obviously any guidance that we give you and no good deed goes unpunished but any guidance we give is always predicated on based upon what we know today and so if something changes that would change that point of view will obviously have to recalibrate it. But just prima fascia having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or lots of building capital and/or capital wouldn't necessarily prima facie change the overall RWA we have. You have to be careful to ensure that by having higher levels of capital does not incentive to want to stretch in the credit box. So we have very tight credit discipline. So I wouldn\u2019t see that being a material change the outlook but obviously if there is a change in rules that directly affect RWA, that would do. Steve Chubak - Nomura:  And then just switching gears to the investment banking outlook that you had given. I appreciated the color which sounded quite constructive on the backlogs for M&A and ECM. And I guess not just you but the industry in general hasn't given much commentary on the outlook for debt capital markets activity. It has been challenged this year. I think that was something which many of us had expected just given the strength that we had experienced over the last couple of years. But I didn't know if you can just provide some updated thoughts on that revenue stream in particular. Marianne Lake :  I mean look it is the case that a lot of refinance has already happened. So the debt maturity wall is smaller although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point in time. So I would -- so therefore yes it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some continued headwind but having said that, I think there is going to be windows of opportunity. So we\u2019re going to -- M&A and ECM are more constructive and likely to be more buoyant, but I think that capital market still has windows of opportunity. Operator :  There are no further questions at this time. Jamie Dimon : Folks, thank you very much for joining us and we will talk to you soon. Marianne Lake :  Thank you.",

And welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the Firm reported net income of $4.9 billion and EPS of $1.19 and the return on tangible common equity of 11% on $23.6 billion of revenue for the quarter. Included in our results with total legal expense of $1.1 billion or approximately $1 billion after tax, in large part an incremental amount for FX. As we go through the presentation, I'll call out other notable items. For your reference, we've included the EPS impact of those here in the front page. In total, they contributed a net positive $0.12 to EPS. So adjusting for legal expenses as well as these items give net income of $5.5 billion and an EPS of $1.33 reflecting solid co performance.  I am going to skip over Page 2 and I am going to go straight to the full year result on Page 3. The Firm reported record net income of nearly $23 billion and record EPS of $5.29 and return on tangible common equity of 13% on nearly $98 billion of revenue. Excluding legal expense which remains elevated, net income for the year were $24 billion and return on tangible common equity 14%. You can see on the page of the bottom that adjusted expense $58.4 billion in line with guidance, and down $150 million from the prior year despite the impact of incremental cost of control as well as continuing to invest in our businesses.  A final couple of points for the year. Core loan growth was strong at 8% year-on-year and net capital distribution for the year was approximately $10 billion including record dividend of $6 billion. Turning to Page 4. The Firm's fully phased in as on CET1 ratio was 10.1% flat to last quarter. With earnings and portfolio run off offset by capital distribution and an increase in risk-weighted asset, were dominantly driven by high account party credit risk. In terms of 2015 outlook, we expect to add 50 basis points or more to this ratio. Similarly, the Firm's fully phased in standardized ratio not on the page also remained flat at 10.5%. The Firm's SLR was 5.6% and the bank's SLR improved to 5.9%. And given the recent FSB proposal which added our best estimate of TLAC at approximately 15% excluding Basel which will be refined as the rules are finalized. Moving on to Page5. And we before we move into each of the businesses, this quarter we changed the presentation of preferred dividend in our lines of business and show the impact here on the page. For the company, preferred dividend was and continues to be below the line. However, we historically allocated the cost of preferred stock to the businesses as net interest expense or contra revenue. With the corresponding positive impact in corporate NI. In order to have a cleaner trends and better pay comparability, we are now presenting preferred dividend below the line at each of our LOBs, which is particularly important given recent increases in preferred issuance. You can see on the slide and the change in methodology has no impact on Firm wise financials, no on LOB returns on equity. But LOB revenue net income and overhead ratios improve, additionally the adjusted affects contra revenue ratio in the CIB. So from here throughout this presentation and also in the supplement, all numbers in all periods consistently reflect this change.  Moving on the business performance. On Page 6, the Consumer & Community Bank. The combined business is generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter. And an ROE of 16% on nearly $11 billion of revenue. Excluding the impact of losses related to non core portfolio exits in card the ROE was 18%. Consumer & Community Banking continues to deliver strong underlying performance, maintaining our number one ranking in customer satisfaction among largest bank for the third year in a row by ACSI. And in addition, we continue to deepen relationship with our customers. Average deposits were up 8% year-on-year with both across regions and markets. Record plan investment assets were up 13%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22% and credit card sales volume was up 10% on strong new account originations. Across CCB, we outperformed our expense target for the year and have reduced headcount by 12,000 this year exceeding Investor Day guidance by roughly 4,000 and over the last three years headcount is down approximately 32,000 across the consumer businesses.  Turning to Page 7, Consumer & Business Banking. For the fourth quarter CBB generated net income of $861 million up 8% year-on-year and an ROE of 31% on improved operating leverage. Net interest income was relatively flat year-on-year but down slightly quarter-on-quarter on low deposit margin. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect continue to put compression in CBB deposit margin driven by lower investment rate will drive a modest decline in NI quarter-over-quarter. Noninterest revenue continued to grow up 6% across investment, debit and other fees. With the addition of approximately 700,000 net new households. And expense was relatively flat with efficiencies self-funding fund investment.  Finally, in business banking the momentum we have seen in recent quarters continued with loan origination for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-on-year. Businesses remain relatively optimistic and banker performance continues to improve.  Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $338 million for the quarter and a 7% ROE. We reduced expenses for the year by $2.3 billion, outperforming our $2 billion target. Moving to the top of the page, production pretax income excluding repurchase was slightly positive for the quarter which was better than guidance on higher volumes and revenue margins. The origination market was more robust due to strong rate rally but we estimate it was down about 5% quarter-on-quarter seasonally. Against which our originations were $23 billion, up 8% quarter-on-quarter reflecting corresponding share gains in jumbo and conventional. So this quarter we increased volumes, we gained approximately 100 basis points of market share estimated and realized higher revenue margins. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter despite the increase in volumes and we continue to focus on controlling costs.  On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of $624 million was down slightly quarter-on-quarter on low balances with servicing expense of $560 million also down slightly. On real estate portfolios, we continued to add high quality loan to our portfolio. We added another $10 billion this quarter, up from $7 billion last quarter. Recorded net charge-offs of $111 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non credit impaired portfolio. Lastly, headcount was down over 7,500 for the year and approximately 22,000 over the last three years.  Moving on to Page 9. Card, Merchant Services and Auto net income of $980 million, down 7% year-on-year with an ROE of 20%. If you exclude reserve releases, net income was up 2%. The strong momentum in our business continues with very strong spend as well as card balance growth of $3 billion in the year. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 4% year-on-year, but up 1% adjusting for losses related to portfolio exit that went through the quarter's result. With an adjusted revenue rate for card shown on the page of 12.2% in line with our guidance. Strong loan and sales growth was offset by spread compression and higher acquisition cost as we continue to add more customers. In 2015, expect a revenue rate to remain at the low end of our target range of 12% to 12.5%. Expense was down 6% year-on-year predominantly driven by remediation cost included in the prior period.  In Card, we led the industry for the 27th consecutive quarter gaining nearly 500 basis points of share during the same period. And this quarter, we saw sales growth of 10%, driven by enhanced client acquisition and reward strategies. In Merchant services volume was up 13% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance. And in auto, result continues to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales as well as stable used car value. This was a 13th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 5% year-on-year. And coming into this year, the pipeline is strong which reflects continued strength in the auto market. Finally, on credit, in card we continue to see improvements in early delinquency and we released $150 million of reserve this quarter. You can see the net charge-off rate adjusted for portfolio exit was down slight at 248 basis points. In 2015, expect the charge-off rate to decline modestly. For auto, credit losses were higher on balance growth and as a charge-off rate start to trend off from historical lows.  Now moving on to Page 10. Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $972 million and an ROE of 5% on $7.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for legal expense, ROE would have been 11% for the quarter and 13% for the year. In banking, IB fees were $1.8 billion, up 8%. We continue to ranked number one in Global IBCs per Dealogic, number one in the U.S. and we moved up to number one in EMEA this year. Record debt underwriting was driven by M&A related financing, strong advisory fees for the quarter contributed to the full year increase, up 24%. And equity underwriting was down from a strong quarter last year, but in line with the overall decline in market issuance. We continue to procure on more deals than any other firm for both the quarter and the year. And the fee pipeline continues to be strong into 2015 with the favorable environment generally across most products. Treasury services revenue was up 3% and lending related revenue of $264 million was down $129 million year-on-year given mark-to-market gains in the prior year. Moving on to markets revenue of $3.6 billion, down 13% year-on-year, but as guided excluding business simplification, the core business was down 5%. Fixed income was $2.5 billion, down 14% excluding business simplification, driven primarily by lower result in credit related and securitized products and with rate markets remaining challenging. However, currencies in emerging market had a strong quarter with higher volatility leading to increased productivity and our remaining financial commodities business is doing well. In equities we saw strong performance for the quarter, up 25% year-on-year at $1.1 billion. Derivatives was very strong, one of the best fourth quarter in recent years largely driven by Asia as plan activity increased on central bank action. Cash was solid, driven primarily by EMEA on the back of a strong ECM result. With respect to markets revenue for the first quarter of 2015, business simplification will continue to drive a negative year-on-year variance. For the quarter approximately $500 million or 10% with the corresponding expense decline of approximately $300 million. Securities services revenues of $1.1 billion, was up 6% year-on-year including high NI on high average deposit. Asset under custody were $20.5 trillion, flat year-on-year with market appreciation largely offset by significant client exit. Credit adjustments and other shows a loss driven by net CVA losses as well as the inclusion of nonrecurring DVA/FVA valuation adjustments totaling approximately $200 million. Moving on to expenses, total expenses up 14% year-on-year, compensation was down 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and down 4% for the year, with a comp to revenue ratio for the year of 30%. The increase is driven by non comp; none comp expense primarily by over $900 million of legal expense as well as higher control related expenses with those being partially offset by business simplification.  Moving on to Commercial Banking on Page11. This quarter saw net income at $693 million with an ROE 19% on $1.8 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 4% sequentially and flat year-on-year excluding the one time proceed of approximately $100 million from a lending related workout that was included in the prior year. Continued deal compression in our lending but as well as the impact of business simplification, it is being offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue increased on better fee revenue and was incredible story for investment banking this quarter with record gross revenue of $557 million, up 11% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. For the full year, Commercial Banking client generated $2 billion of investment banking revenue for the Firm, reaching our goal. Expense was in line with guidance, slightly higher year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter due to the ongoing investment in controls. In loan balances, we saw an increase of $4.7 billion, our best quarter of growth since 2011, driven by strong performance in our commercial real estate businesses as well as both in C&I portfolio this quarter. Our CRE have now grown for 15 consecutive quarters and for the quarter grew 4% ahead of the industry. C&I loans grew 3% this quarter in line with the industry and with pipelines remaining solid. Finally in terms of credit performance an exceptional year, another single digit net charge-off rate for the quarter at eight basis point and a slight net recovery position for the full year.  Moving on to Page 12. A solid quarter in Asset Management with net income of $540 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. Last year included a mark-to-market gain of approximately $100 million. Adjusting for that revenue was up 4%, expense of $2.3 million was up 3% and net income up 5% on positive operating leverage.  This quarter marks the 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term net inflow at $10 billion driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 9% year-on-year. And we achieved the number one ranking in 2014 for global net inflow in active long-term mutual fund. We continue to see strength in our multi asset and fixed income flows and although smaller equity inflows outpaced the industry. Banking had record loan balances up 11% year-on-year with growth coming from both U.S. and international market and record deposit up 6%. As reported client assets of $2.4 trillion were up 2% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, but excluding business simplification client assets would have been up 8% year-on-year. Lastly, for the full year, we will continue strong investment performance. This was a second consecutive year of long-term net inflows of over $80 billion. Driving a fifth year of record revenue and second year of record net income, with 23% ROE and 29% pretax margin. AUM loans and deposits were also record for the year.  Turning to Page 13. Corporate & Private Equity. Private Equity reported $107 million of net income primarily driven by private equity gain of approximately $450 million, partially offset by a little over $200 million of related goodwill impairment. This past Friday we completed the spin off of one equity partner and the investment professionals have formed the new independent company OEP Capital Advisors. At the same time, we closed on the sale of a portion of our private equity portfolio through a group of private equity firm. OEP Capital Advisors will continue to manage both the investments we sold as well as the investments we've retained. And closing this transaction had no significant impacts to fourth quarter financials. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $205 million, but remember this is after the impact of the change in how we allocate preferred dividend. Firm NI was $11.3 billion flat quarter-on-quarter. And finally in other corporate, net income was $645 million, including in this result were tax related benefit of approximately $500 million, partially offset by contribution we made to our foundation of approximately $150 million and close to $100 million pretax of legal expense.  So to wrap up 2014 was a record year for both net income and EPS, with the 13% return on tangible common equity despite elevated legal expenses and despite headwinds from capital market, mortgage and the low interest rate environment. We maintained excellent customer satisfaction result and we gained share in many of our businesses. Delivered on our commitment including business simplification, control and expense discipline and we also met our capital target for the year while returning $10 billion of net capital to shareholders. So with that we will open to Q&A operator. You can open up the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hi, okay, so a couple of questions. One is on the GSIB proposal. Obviously, it looks like you are at the 450 over the 7% minimum. And I know we can't exactly see because we don't have all the rules around the short-term whole sale funding rule but I am wondering will you line up in that bucket if you are close to the low end of that range? Is there anything that you could do to move down a bucket? Marianne Lake : So, Betsy, obviously two things. The first thing is that the most important time period when this is going to matter is when its in full and compliance and through the transition period in 2017 and 2018. So result in the 450 bucket as we understand is based on 2013 results that we had to work over the quarter next three years to make sure we are maximizing every basis point of GSIB and every dollar of capital to the fullest extent to deliver return. So rather say that to move down a bucket it is in general term is fairly significant thing to do. Just given the types of things are driving the overall score. But we are not complacent about it. We worked a near extreme granularity to make sure that from the very first basic point that we are certain we are maximizing the return opportunity for that within the context of the bucket we are in. So it would not be a trivial exercise to move down but we are focused on making sure that we are optimizing the resources that are our most binding constraint. Betsy Graseck : Right. It is a bit of challenge because it is relative to global peer so how do you run the business, the follow on question is how you run the business when you have been used to trying a gain as much market share as you can but now gaining market share kind of works against you on this G-SIFI? Marianne Lake : I think it is probably worth mentioning that while we were in the -- or look like we might be in the highest bucket relative to our peers, there were peers that were in higher bucket and they are not constrained by GSIB but CCAR. So it is likely to be the case. We continue to believe it is likely to be the case that you're going to see the differential in required capital for a variety of reasons not being as wide as might be implied by the GSIB. And so the key question is whether we are delivering the right shareholder value and incremental capital which we clearly thing we are and can continue to do. And so it is -- we are trying to thread the needle as you say about making sure that we are as focused as we can on maximizing the use of that scarce resource but within the bucket that we end up being wherever that might be, that our key priorities to deliver the highest ROE and the shareholder value we can, particularly in the world where others maybe more constrained by balance sheet or leverage. So it is a fine dance and it's what we are working through. We'll obviously keep you updated as we continue to progress our plan. Betsy Graseck : Okay. I assume we'll hear more on Investor Day. Operator : And your next is from the line of John McDonald with Stanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, Marianne. Just kind of following up on Betsy's questions. Your hope is to grow or I guess your expectation is to grow the common equity Tier 1 from the 10.1 today to -- did you say 50 basis points this year you hope to add to that? Marianne Lake : Yes. 50 basis points or possibly more. John McDonald : Okay. And I guess could you give us some sense of what the assumption embedded in there are in terms of RWA mitigation, I guess kind of street estimate and earnings and some expectations for capital return? And I guess is that pace enough to get what you see as the new GSIB buffers where it look to us you might have to be at 11.5, 12 or is just a timing question? And you have time to get to 11.5, 12. If you could walk through that would be helpful. Thanks. Marianne Lake : Okay. Let me start at the beginning which is -- if you look at our Basel III advanced RWA on the slide, it is just little over $1.6 trillion, when we were in Investor Day, last year we said that we expected to be able to provide reduction to that by the end of 2015 to get the number closer to $1.5 trillion on the back of near model related benefit and et cetera. It is still the case, so that's the direction we will move in whether we get exactly to $1.5 trillion or slightly over will depend on the timing of some of those benefits but that's direction where we are going. So call it from a little over $1.6 trillion to a little over $1.5 trillion and we will give you an update at Investor Day. With respect to the assumptions, at the end of the day we generate a lot of capital and if we need to comply more quickly than we intend to do then we can clearly pull those levers. But we have always over the last couple of years have the approach of wanting to have a reasonable sense of urgency but a measured pace to get in where we need to be over the course of a transition period as well as preserving the optionality to continue to increase dividend and do buybacks. That continues to be generally our philosophy. And if you take, I think I said this before and don't read anything into this with respect to capital asks or anything else but if you take analysts estimate for the next two three years and take a $1.5 trillion or even slightly higher RWA basis, you can continue to add 50 basis points of capital a year as well as have meaningful buyback and capital distribution capacity. And 50 basis points a year from a little over 10% over three or four years get see to the other side of 11.5. So that just an illustration of capacity we have not necessarily a sort of commitment in terms of glide path but that's the basis upon which we feel like we will be able to add 50 basis points this year which is on a fully phased and advanced basis which is we think an appropriate glide path. Jamie Dimon : And we haven't really started to manage GSIFI which we are going to do now. John McDonald : Okay. And just a follow up on that is on TLAC. You mentioned in some of the notes here that you might feel any potential short fall to the current TLAC with additional common equity tier 1 which I assume you mean as opposed to kind of debt issuance or preferred, just wondering why you think that would be the best approach since you might already being building set one for GSIB buffer. Jamie Dimon : John, she didn't say that. We are going to meet our common Tier 1 with the bucket we think is appropriate and we would fill the rest of TLAC with debt, supporting debt or preferred we need to. Marianne Lake : Yes. I think, John, it is something you are looking at that we confused you; I apologize for that -- for the purpose of clarity. We expect to grow into GSIB buffer which would be at two different TLAC with common equity and whatever they got maybe when the rules are finalized on TLAC somewhere between nothing and something more meaningful, that's likely to be in debt issuance. John McDonald : Okay, got it. That's what I thought. I was just looking at that footnote 10 on page 20 maybe we just we could take a look at that afterwards. Marianne Lake : I apologize. We will take a look at that. Operator : Next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Just wanted to talk about expenses and initially focusing on the litigation charge of $1 billion after tax. It is pretty clear as you said that the bulk of it goes to the investment bank and that it affects as you said but should this give us a sense that you now feel that it is reasonable that you have reasonable and probably basis to think in terms of what your settlement would be --say with the DOJ or are there other elements that drove the increment? Marianne Lake : So, Guy, both the reserves that we take in the quarter represents our best estimate based upon facts and circumstances, as you know that must be the end of the quarter with respect to ongoing dialogue and investigations but they are not concluded so as much as we would like to, we can give you no assurances with respect to the final conclusion. And that's really what we can say about where we are on the FX matter. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. And then more broadly on expense, just given that we've seen another decline in net interest margin that we've got flattening yield curve environment and quite a bit of sluggishness elsewhere. And of course all the regulatory capital requirements that continue to build. Should we expect that revisit your $58 billion-ish expense target in someway to bring that meaningfully down? Marianne Lake : So just one quick thing on NIM before I talk about expense. Just --we kind of manage the NIM -- NIM can be reasonably volatile purely as a feature of the amount of cash that we have in our balance sheet. What you saw this quarter in terms of NIM which was five or six basis points decline whether you are looking at firm or core, is in very large part driven by incremental cash balances close to $50 billion. Guy Moszkowski : Which leave there for days. Marianne Lake : Some of which there for days, some of which is an accretive from an NI perspective will be at modestly. So I think the more important measure for us anyway quarter-over-quarter is that our NI was flat. So and then just in terms of the flattening yield curve, we are more geared towards and so right to move and we still expecting that to happen in second half of the year. And so what really matter for us is Fed funds not withstanding the overall yield curve. With respect to expenses, yes, we will give you more updates at Investor Day. But I can continue to reiterate what we said in the past which is we would continue to expect to push our adjusted expense absolute dollars downwards over the course of the next several years. And in combination with hopefully an improving economy and better interest rate move towards the 55% plus or minus -- the 55% over head ratio over the medium term. So you would expect-- you should expect our adjusted expenses in 2015 to be down, but we continue to have albeit that we reach the peak in second half of the year, we continue to have elevated cost of control and some of that leverage will be more in 2016 and 2016 than in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, I'm following up on the expense question. If you look at slides 2 and 3, it looks like your adjusted efficiency ratio of 61% in the fourth quarter and 60% for the year got worse from 59% either the prior quarter or prior year. So it's gone the wrong direction and I thought you said that you had some peak in costs in midyear and I hear what you're saying about guidance at Investor Day and adjusted expenses in 2015 down, but can you give any more ins and outs on why you think the efficiency ratio on a core basis should improve? Marianne Lake : So a little bit it was driving efficiency ratio in second half versus the first half is seasonality in revenues and year-on-year revenues were down slightly. So obviously it is a little bit elevated relative to 59% to 60% ratio but obviously the absolute dollars on a downward trend. And hopefully what we are going to see in combination over the course of the next year or two is we will continue to look at efficiency in our controlled spend. As I say we are going to be looking at that in 2015 relative to the exit 2014 right. So you are going to see more of that leverage in 2016 and 2017. We will continue to bring mortgage cost down, cost within the branches down and but affecting against that hopefully we will have stronger performance in some of our businesses and show some expense growth. So overall trending down and but revenues are positive story and they were down year-on-year. Mike Mayo : It's been three years kind of stalled progress with overall efficiency. I know you have some of your reasons with regulatory costs. You mentioned 2016 and 2017 benefits, but can investors see an improvement in efficiency expenses for revenues in 2015? Marianne Lake : Well, so, Mike, we will give you the low down at our Investor Day, you will see absolute reduction in dollars and we will give you the outlook for the efficiency ratio then. Operator : Next question comes from the line Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. You had some good loan growth in consumer and in particular credit card in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering how much of that is kind of normal seasonality versus maybe some strengthening underlying demand for the consumer. Marianne Lake : So I would say a bit of both actually, as obviously as you articulate, we do seasonality but we did reach an inflection point during the year where we started to see more -- a little bit more demand anyway to greater extension. But I'd say our outlook for credit card outstanding gross for 2015 is sort of modest low single digit growth not higher than that. So a little bit of both and but we are flatted by seasonality in terms of the fourth quarter. Matt O'Connor: Okay, then just separately in terms of the sharp decline in energy in general and I guess oil specifically, how do we think about some of the puts and takes with your customer base? Obviously, this should be good for the consumer maybe mixed for corporates and institutional. There might be some risk to certain countries. Like how should we think about this holistically and how do you try and stay on top of this? Marianne Lake : So JPMorgan taking in three pieces. Yes, we think it's very good for the consumer on balance and also for the economy on balance despite strengthening dollar. So we think that the consumer spend, consumer even quite expenses likely to be positive as a result. From a trading perspective there are pluses and minuses. The oil price volatility contributed to the softer quarter in the credit space, but was hopeful as it related to the currency the commodity space so in fact net-net mutual to maybe even slightly favorable. And then with respect to our traditional credit exposure to the sector, it is about 5% of our overall credit exposure and well secured top of the capital structure where it is name by name analysis that we do. We feel comfortable with where we are right now. It is cyclical business and we are expecting downgrade but we are not facing any meaningful issues in the face right now. Overall, oil is a reasonable positive for the economy and consumer and so for JPMorgan from the financial perspective a modest issue, positive or negative. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. My primary question is there's clearly been a lot of ink spilled recently in conversations again about a potential breakup of JPMorgan, especially relative to the higher capital buffers that could come from the Fed. And I guess, Jamie, could you remind us of how you're thinking about the benefits of keeping the franchise consolidated for the shareholders versus some of the conversation that investors are having today about breaking up or shrinking the bank in order to step down on your capital buffers? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So first I dispute the fact that some investors, there are some people wrote about it as a possibility because of excess capital and that's true, you have to hold more capital, things be equal, it will reduce your returns. But even the people wrote about that, talk about these superior franchises, the benefits of synergies, the good the company brings to there. So the first way to look at a business first and foremost has been and always will be what do you for customers. Not what you do for yourself and your return et cetera. And on the customer franchise and every business were gaining shares, we have good returns, we've got good market shares. We've got good customer sat levels. The synergies are huge, both expense and revenue synergies et cetera and some not all disappear under the various schematics of a breakup or something like that. That's number one. And the question is now you are bearing after capital, how bad is that relative to that and for the most probably we will able to manage that. We've talked about products repricing and managing GSIB, managing CCAR, managing LCR, managing SLR and we are going to maintain the franchise, manage it-- we still think we get good returns. Now there is a point to which the capital drag would be so high that you may want to consider alternatives, but just remember they are not simple. Like anything you do, every company will have to have cash management, global tradability, every company general ledgers and HR things and data centers and nerve data centers inside the security and it just-- it isn't that simple process. But so far the company has earned good returns in all these businesses to wrap this crisis. And I am going back to 2010, 2011 and 2012 and that's a sign of stability. In fact, even Mike Mayo had a report which there is a slide that shows the volatility of returns. And we among the lowest with the better returns. So that is proving it. but the model works in the business standpoint, yes, we have to carry more capital and will manage that over time. Marianne Lake : Erika, just add to that, we are still in a period of flux as it relates to in a broadly rule, not just capital rule and we are in a period that got to relate to the competitive environment. And it would be for us, it would premature to take these strategic decisions that we don't think would add shareholder value in what is a very sort of challenging influx and cyclical low for the environment. So we preserve optionality. We think we are generating significant shareholder value, significant synergies and any discount could arrive regardless. Jamie Dimon : And remember the capital stuff is not an element is not -- what they are doing now is not a size of riskiness; this company has been a fortress company. It has delivered decline, so its diversification is the reason why you said less volatility of earnings, was able go through crisis and never loss money ever, not one quarter. And so in the real life crisis gets fine, any future crisis we are going to do fine. There is reason you have big global multi national banks. And they are so big global multi national including government. This company movies $6 trillion to $10 trillion a day, you are not going to do that as a small bank. And you are not going to syndicate out of $20 billion bridge loan and you can't do certain things globally in 20 countries if you are in 20 countries. So you got to figure out what model you have and does it make sense. And it's not necessary comparable to all other companies. So all model make sense to you, you have seen return in it. Erika Najarian : Understood. And just a follow-up question to that, Marianne, if we look at the GSIB scoring process not the proposed Fed process and we think about the five pillars that drive the buffers, it seems like if we look at publicly available data that where JPMorgan really sticks out is under the complexity pillar. Is there any way to move that down without giving up significant meaningful revenue and is that the bucket of focus in terms of potentially managing buffers from here? Marianne Lake : So you are right the complexity bucket does stick out. Just for what it look, we are looking at each bucket and we are looking at a very granular level because obviously we need to look at the whole thing in combination. And the complexity bucket, Jamie said I think earlier, if he didn't I just repeat. OTC derivatives, there is now drives a large chunk of it. Clearly, we are going to do everything we can in terms of netting and housekeeping and everything to reduce stock meaningfully is to have a meaningful impact on our client flow business. Level three assets is second piece and obviously to the degree that those things are -- by definition they are less liquid and so a result -- Jamie Dimon : Does that not make them bad? Marianne Lake : That does not make them bad. They are just less liquid and as a result we obviously will take a look at whether or not there is opportunity to reduce that. But again it is also relative to market size. And then finally our AFS portfolio which to have in a complexity bucket is not intuitive to all of us and over time that may reduce but right now it is a very core part of how we think about structuring the interest rate, risk management of our balance sheet. So we are going to look at it but we are going to get very, very granular. And there is no silver bullet. Jamie Dimon : I'd add so years we can drive it down without damaging the franchise. Marianne Lake : Right. It is about looking at the first 10-20 basis points not the last three or four. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Can we revisit the energy conversation for a sec? I mean in my experience when any asset class falls this much so quickly, it's usually pretty bad and I heard your comments and I completely agree that it's great for the consumer and net-net positive, but am I doing the math right? If it's 5% of your outstanding, is that on the $743 billion of loans? Jamie Dimon : That's commercial. Glenn Schorr : Commercial, okay. Because what I want to get at is you made a comment it's 5% of outstandings; a lot of it is secured. I'm sure you have some reserves against it. It's just -- it seems like an odd thing. I know it's early and we'll see if it stays down here, but it seems like a big deal and yet it doesn't seem like a big deal to you guys. So I just want to make sure that we talk about what your exact exposures are and why you feel better than most people I talk to. Marianne Lake : So our exposures are about $46 billion, about 5%, there are just no credit portfolio and about two -- 70% of its investment grade about, two third is in the sort of CIB, so these are large well capitalized company. And the others are in the commercial bank, name by name we understand that what looks like these are asset based loans, top of the capital structure, names we know and we are going to see downgrades and we are not suggesting that there isn't going to be some stress and we don't where oil may bottom. But, yes, we do have reserves. We have reserves based upon a long history of day that include cycles; it seems cycles before like this. And so we will take downgrade maybe --we may need to take more reserve but it doesn't feel like it say very significant issue or imminent series of charge -off rates now. Jamie Dimon : For us there will be companies that are more invested in oil that may have different issues. And then there is a secondary effect which obviously you all can predict like Russia, Venezuela. So, Russia, we have exposure. Venezuela virtually none and other countries. And there is another secondary effect. If you are talking about commercial or even consumer real estate, Dallas, Denver, Houston. As you saw in 1986, 1989 and those all slight negative. But not again -- for us they are not mutual, very well diversified. And for us who have the other side. General consumer credit will be better not worse. And you can argue and I don't spend too much time on it. But that even retail will be better. There are whole bunch other beneficiaries of this change of credit. So some will be worse and some will be better, so for net-net for us it's just not that big deal. It is a perfect legitimate thing we all be concerned about for companies which are very concentrated in oil or even commercial real estate companies concentrated in oil areas. So that's not something that we need to worry about. Marianne Lake : So we are watching it closely and to Jamie's point, we are paying attention to our real estate portfolios in those geographies so that's going to be overall sector on geographical differences and how to this plays out and we are paying attention to that. Jamie Dimon : It is a good example of diversity helps, yes. Glenn Schorr : Yes. I appreciate that. The only related follow-up I have is I don't know if the same thing is happening in oil. I know in and around October 15 when we had wild swings in the 10-year, people talked about less liquidity at the banks being a partial contributor. I'm curious to see if you think there's something to do with that on the oil side too because everybody's been downsizing commodities. And then the bigger question is does anybody care about it, are the regulators watching and paying attention and do you think some of this is contributing to the bigger volatile swings we're seeing? Marianne Lake : On the first point, I think there is probably some true to the less liquidity but it is more about over supply and lack of global growth simulating demand than it is I think a liquidity story from a capital market perspective. Sorry, Jamie, you are going to -- Jamie Dimon : I would just add that when you are look at -- I am surprised that people so surprised when commodity moves like this. Commodities move like this my whole life. And obviously the supply and demand imbalance and Marianne mentioned that United States supply has gone up by 5 million barrels a day for the last five or six years. People are little surprised that the production that was positive about Libyan, Iran and Iraq and some other places, a lot of people need oil revenues but the other things that surprise people with slightly increased demand, not I say slightly China and some other places and the other one that surprised people is OPEC. Instead of OPEC making some kind of move to reduce supply they didn't. But to me oil commodities have kind of evolve to, oil is at even more evolve to so in the oil business you got to prepare for something like that. That is the way it is going to be. And that's the way for to us like. And yes speculation, inventory and all these things may affect in the short run. Remember, there is a focal point at which oil, the margin with dollar can be produced and I think our economies says that's $75 oil deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. And one data recover that because the world still will use more oil and need more oil et cetera and in the meantime you got to manage around the volatility and I don't think any of that had to do with trading. Not a -- but had to do with fundamental supply demand and balances and people getting prepared for it and taking views and not us, I am talking about oil companies and you read about countries who hedged it and countries who didn't and companies who hedged, companies who didn't and I think it is a legitimate concern about liquidity in markets that when we have volatile markets or violent markets, how much liquidity will remain but I think you there you are talking more about-- which you saw a little bit in treasuries but it is about credit. And it's possible. We just don't really know. So we are little worried about it. But we will there hopefully making healthy mortgage for our clients when the times come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on some of the regulatory discussion that we've had. You mentioned back in December that you felt that even though at the 11.5% buffer there may not be as big a difference in terms of capital requirements between you and some of your US peers as the initial numbers may initially indicate. It sounded like that may have been a focus on the short-term wholesale funding buffer, which obviously hasn't been released. You mentioned in December you felt that that would be around 50 basis points in terms of at least a starting point for you all. Is it your sense that there could be calibrations above and below your level of 50 basis points or do you think at this point it could be a blanket number across all of the big banks? Marianne Lake : No. Look obviously we need to get clear on what the final rules and calculation that's like; I don't see it being blanket number. I think it is pretty evidence that it intended to be least measured relative to the size, if the one measure that's not measured relative to a market share but relative to the size of your operation and so consequently depending upon how the math works out, it could be differentiation for other people. But my comment were not necessarily driven by whether or not somebody else going to be more punitive, will penalize by short-term wholesale funding but by the fact that GSIB hasn't been and it is unlikely to be the binding constraint for some our competitors. For some of those it CCAR stress, for some it is leverage on CCAR stress and as a result they already are running at or above the level that maybe implied and that may continue to increase. So here we have a situation where the transition period the glide path is a four year period where it temporary run looking to put a glide path together that measures all of our objective over the next few years where others are after approaching 11%. So we will see obviously had phased out in the medium term or in short term I should say, certainly in the short term we have a reasonably level playing field. And the competitive landscape is changing and we are working very hard to make sure we are maximizing a return on every dollar we had. Jamie Dimon : And the reason it went for 2.5 to 4 wasn't because a short term also funding because it doubled, it basically doubled the number on a new methodology. And so and I think when you spoke at 50 base point above you also made a short term wholesale funding buffer, you terminate buffer over required number to handle volatility. Marianne Lake : Yes. So the buffer yes totally volatility driven, the 50 basis point is the best estimate of what the short term wholesale contribute to the -- Jamie Dimon : Added to it, yes. That is GSIB requirement also. Marianne Lake : We will say, my view it is not a blanket though you could see some people differentiated in that sense. Matt Burnell : Fair enough. And then, Marianne, just for a follow-up, in terms of your outlook for GDP, I think in December you also mentioned that you expected around 3% GDP growth is kind of your operating assumption. A little stronger in the second half than the first half. Given your comments on when you think rates are going up, it doesn't sound like that has changed very much, but given your conversations about oil and some of the other growth numbers that have come out, has that changed very much? Marianne Lake : So I mean obviously if you get sort of granular -- Jamie Dimon : We moved into 3.1% Marianne Lake : Obviously if you get granular to different specific and countries you have a different answer but as a general matter, no, as a general matter for U.S. 2015 over 2014 according to 2.5% and globally closer to 3%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Jamie, you were very clear on the success of the global franchise that you guys have built and the success that you've been having with it. Is there any evidence that you're seeing some pricing increases or you can generate some pricing increases because of this franchise? And if not yet, what do you think it's going to take where you'll be able to really get some better pricing because of the value of the franchise that you present to your customers? Jamie Dimon : Yes, so it's a tough question to answer. We've seen some pricing changes in trade finance a little bit in prime broker not really in credit but I do think that you are going to see some in credit. So over time but that's not because of JPMorgan. That's just because the market is going to reprice some of these things it is more expensive to do. And we do expect that will happen somewhere over time. And remember the other thing which is really important, we manage this by client. So you can actually do a better job in LCRG, SIFI, CCAR by client and not change pricing just change mix. And so we are working 100 different ways to figure how to get good returns to shareholders while doing a good job for clients. Remember, we have more opportunities to do that. So whenever we talked to a client they don't want some of our balance sheet capability but they -- and they maybe willing to do other business with you to make sure they get it, even the pricing doesn't change and it might be good for us. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up, in the Corporate & Investment Bank, the world now has been operating under the Volcker rules since July of 2014. Can you share with us is there any secular trends that you're seeing because of that? And I noticed that your compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was a real low 27% versus 35% a year ago. Is that reflective of the changes because of the Volcker rule? Jamie Dimon : I mean it just a Volcker rule, so we have accommodated Volcker rule which we have to do in private equity and investment and hedge funds and Marianne mentioned that we closed the sale of couple of billion at private equity stuff. And even the CLO issue is a very temporary thing. The only question the CLO is should people be forced to sell greater than the -- they are all going to run off in three to seven years. So not a question of bank -- and that is not a material issue to us, we are going to accommodate that. The other thing that's important of Volcker is now the remaining one. How it affects market making and obviously they are the clients are going to be concerned. Do you have a good market making? There are always rules around. It would accommodate those reporting, your client demand, aged inventory, different ways of reporting volatility in trading, and now you have capital liquidity, all the trading is try to get make it safer but also so people can markets and we hope at the end day that will happen. If there needs to be adjustments because new clients are going to say, this isn't working for us. The other thing I'll mention about liquidity, spreads are kind of the same in credit. But the size you can trade is much smaller which to me it is early indicator if something goes wrong, you are going to have gap that spreads quicker and wider than it might have before. So but at the end of the day we hoped to be able to be a good market maker, earned returns for shareholders and obviously we got-- we have to playing out probably Volcker and all the other regulations stored in them. Marianne Lake : I think the thing to -- think about when you look at the come to revenue ratio just for the purpose of clarity if you look at the fourth quarter of last year excluding DVA and FVA, it was above 20 % to 26%, closer to in line year-over-year and that's evidence when you look at the full year ratio of last year 31% to 30%. So they are with the low end of our range of 30% but within the range relative to the performance and there was a big negative impact in the CPI on a revenue basis last year with DVA /FVA. Jamie Dimon : And I just say that we always allocated capital to investment bank. And we've had HBA adjusted returns and stuff like that. So as you allocate more capital all things being equal that number comes down a little bit. As you kind of disciplined and try to do that properly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Steve Chubak : Hi, good morning. So first question I have is on actually the debt capital markets business. Clearly, the results were quite impressive in the quarter. Certainly better than what the public proxy suggested and I was hoping you could give some additional color as to what drove this strength and then maybe how that informs your outlook in 2015 given that, on the last earnings call, Marianne, you noted that there could be some pressure on that business certainly going into next year or now this coming year? Marianne Lake : Well, I mean I think if you look at the 2015 dynamics there is going to be three principal things, 2014 was a year of larger deals, and 2015 is still got a good pipeline. So we are expecting to have reasonably strong -- at least start the year and probably strong year. And it is very driven in the fourth quarter and likely to continue to be so by sort of M&A related financing and so the downside we talked about is just less sort of maturities to be refinanced but nevertheless some. But we are going to continue to have support from the M&A side with respect to be fairly strong in 2015. So you got some puts and takes for what we think is going to be a solid to good year in 2015 maybe not, and maybe not a record but certainly a good year. Jamie Dimon : And so JPMorgan maintained a number one share in Global Investment grade, number one share in Global high yield, number one share in loans indication and which we hoped to maintain next year too. And those are very powerful positions to have. Steve Chubak : Certainly. And switching gears for a moment just back to the capital discussion, I just wanted to get a better understanding as to what drove the RWA inflation in the coming quarter. It sounded as though it was really primarily a function of counterparty credit risk inflation. I just wanted to get a better sense as to whether that was driven by some of the pressures on the corporates in the oil and energy space and also whether your $1.5 trillion target that you reaffirmed, whether that does contemplate the potential risk for further inflation in the coming quarters if those pressures continue. Marianne Lake : So just I mean certainly well I think to put into context I think that the RWA growth was $12 billion so nevertheless a growth but not a huge number up. A chunk of is with regular way CVA which just in part has got to do with just no more market dynamics right now and spreads wider and volatility higher but a chunk of it is unrelated to that. And as we look forward to the end of next year at $1.5 trillion, well just to be clear I think I said $1.5 trillion or maybe slightly higher but nevertheless in a lot of big numbers the same trajectory, it more at risk from just the timing of our ability to execute on granular segmented model, model approval and internally with regulators than necessarily any sort of market dynamic not withstanding that will factor in. So I would say the bigger risk to achieving that unless sort of market pricing impact from CVA but more so ability for us to get the right timing of that model benefit. Jamie Dimon : Then I think like two thirds of model and one thirds is run off stuff, we know that's going to happen. And other thing as Marianne mentioned the advanced we are at 10.1% just generalize with 10.5% and yes the advance will change, spreads gap out, advance will go up but standardized won't. So eventually we think standardized can become the binding constraint not advanced. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. My question was on the Consumer & Community Banking business. There are a couple of moving pieces this quarter with the sale of the card results, but also underneath that it looked like a couple of the fee-related areas might have been a little soft. I was just wondering if you can try to disaggregate that for us and was there anything that was also more of a one-time in nature or seasonal about those businesses this quarter. Marianne Lake : So obviously we talked about the cards portfolio that's driving some revenue decline also some elevated credit charge-offs. We have been experience and I think we guided to the low end of our 12.5% revenue rate change and we guided to that last quarter, the quarter before at a 12.2% in that range and what we are experiencing is spread compression is largely offsetting the strong interchange and other fee growth from the product volume, but when you acquire new customers and you pay the premium to acquire new customers that gets amortized to your results in the first year. So in years when you are net acquiring new customers, you will have a small net drag on your fees and on your revenue rate resulting from amortizing those premiums for the benefit of those strong relationships and the increased outstanding and spend sales volumes you get in future years. So we have been on a journey for the last two years and we continue to be on it way, there is some impact associated from the fact that we are now acquiring new customers each of which we believe returns hurdle for us or more than hurdle for us is accreted over a period. Ken Usdin : Okay. So it's a today versus tomorrow thing. And then on a follow-up, coming back to the energy discussion, you mentioned that it would be net to the consumer business and I just wanted to ask you to flesh that out for us. As you think about the benefits that you'd expect to get from the decline in oil prices, is it growth, is it spend, is it credit? How would you disaggregate that and give us an understanding of either magnitude or just time to see that benefit? Jamie Dimon : I wouldn't spend too much time trying to build this into your models if I were you, but it is quite clear that when you add $800 a year to the consumer cash flow statement that they consumers on average spend most of that. And I think you are seeing it in spend. And you are seeing in car sales, and you are seeing in retail spend, you've seen it -- and it is also quite clear it helps consumers. It helps their credit. I mean broadly. I mean we are not going out and saying that we are going to reduce credit cost and auto card and a bunch of stuff by kind of 15 basis points. I mean just you know it is going to be there. Just like you know was there when they are in the flipside. People spent a lot of time talking about how much gas price is hurting consumers and why shares down at Walmart, Family Dollar store et cetera. This is just the flipside of that. Marianne Lake : And if you just look at the consumer spending specific, if you look at four quarter analyzed up 4.7% is the best consumer spend basis in 2003. So it is already taking effect in consumer spend and the disposable income as you say we are already expecting a new cost sales to grow next year but all of this is going to support the continued strong that we see in consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research Group. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Just want to follow up on the card fee income discussion. If you looked at your new accounts opened year-over-year, you were flat. You're starting to seem -- you seem like you're starting to lap that higher amortization of acquisition costs. So is it fair to assume that we are at least getting closer to an inflection point where we're going to see fee incomes more track more closely with growth in spend or is there something else going on there? Marianne Lake : So you are right we are close to where -- we are close to lapping the acquisition cost dynamic not discloses but in the near future. But what you are going to continue to see is that we have a portfolio that in one off and as those lows run off they were loans that were high up and high rate loans than the ones we are originating right now. And as a result you are going to continue to see some spread compression in 2015 again against which you are going to see strong interchange. So I would say, yes, ultimately and in the fullness of time you are going to start to see the interchange growth outpace the spread compression but for a period of time there going to be somewhat of wash. Jim Mitchell : Right, but I was just speaking specifically to the fee income where you were down I think 7% year-over-year. I would think that would start to turn positive at some point. Marianne Lake : Yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one quick question on the expense side. You talked about the simplification impact on revenues and expenses. You're still at sort of a net negative about $200 million pretaxes. Should that get closer to zero? Is it just it takes a little longer to get the expenses out versus the revenues or is that going to be a permanent drag? Marianne Lake : So there is a -- overall the rate of income asset is not ultimately going to be necessarily zero, but when you think about in the context of the capital and the relative returns, it was not accretive our returns. And so we have the differential between 500 and 300 for the full year, it is still not zero. There is a slight lack. Clearly the slight lack taking out the expenses and but this is overall small net income impact but for overall mutual to positive benefit on the return. Jim Mitchell : Okay, got you, thanks. Marianne Lake : And regard these all that, remember, that our rationale for business simplification included a bunch of different reasons included activities that were core to our core clients' activities that were outsized in terms of operational and other risks as well as those that were returning hurdles. So there are other reasons to simply your business and they will have other ancillary benefit. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. A quick question on derivatives and equities. You guys highlighted the strength there. Were there any one-timers in those results because it certainly seemed like 4Q was volatile. Also did the uptick in equities VAR have anything to do with the revenue trends there? Marianne Lake : So no specific one time items in the derivative and equities derivate performance. And the uptick VAR has to do generally speaking with high levels of volatility that it does with anything in terms of risk direction. Jamie Dimon : Equity derivatives largely Japan and Europe and Asia, they increase -- Marianne Lake : South Asia, yes. Brennan Hawken : And that's true across -- Jamie Dimon : That's the actual volatile -- is an example of volatility did actually help. Marianne Lake : If you look at equities in total and particularly in the prime space, there was a small one time item but not in the derivative space. Brennan Hawken : Got it. And that change in VAR due to volatility was sort of across the board in the buckets, not just in the equities VAR? Marianne Lake : It is not a significant increase in VAR but yes we had -- you see increase in CPG VAR, on spread widening and volatility increase in equities, I mean just year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter we have seen an increase in volatility. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then sticking with capital markets, thinking about how we're starting the current quarter, it does feel a lot like deja vu here in the beginning of the fourth quarter where the markets are beginning with some pretty unconstructive volatility. I know we're very, very early going, but is that a fair comparison to make and are we starting off on a pretty tough foot here? Obviously there's a lot of road to hoe here, but any comments on that would be helpful. Marianne Lake : I mean this quarter more than any quarter, it is like really honestly too early to make any comments of any note regarding trading performance particularly given that the holiday sale mid week, so reality the situation is dramatically nothing has changed from the end of the fourth quarter, but there is no big new news in the first few days of trading. Brennan Hawken : Great. Last small cleanup one on capital markets. I know you've mentioned that there's going to be a lag from business simplification, but was any of the declines in comp in CIB tied to business simplification here? Just trying to think about how much of that drop might have been due to some other items aside from -- Jamie Dimon : It got year on clean up; it had nothing to do with business simplification. Brennan Hawken : Perfect, thanks. Marianne Lake : And I think if you look at our revenues excluding SVA/DVA year-over-year that's on reasonably line with comp. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, you're definitely picking up market share from probably your -- you were shedding market share up until probably the second quarter of this year and one of the chatters out there is that you've gotten more aggressive in the correspondent markets and the comment you made, Jamie, back in I think June of this year was that you wanted to get out on -- maybe not get out of, but lessen your exposure to those low FICO, high LTVs, i.e. FHA loans. I was wondering if you are still trying to lower your market share in FHA loans. Can you make some comments about being more aggressive on the correspondent side too? Jamie Dimon : I think they are two different issues. One is the correspondent business, properly done is fine and obviously we do look at their credit underlying because we had a back up over that 5 to 10 years correspond single loan over business and if we did a bad job we had pay for that. So you have to be more careful and do business with a proper kind of people. We have reduced our share of FHA loan just because the ongoing two reasons. One is the ongoing liability in the production side where the insurance was worthless over time. And the second is the just to cost to servicing FHA loans when they are going default and they have a much higher chance of going to default than not. So those are two reasons to do less. And that maybe I'll change over time but we are still in the same place in that. Marianne Lake : And just on the share gains, they are in jumbo and commercial conforming loans not in the government space. So, yes, we are -- we are competing aggressively on price but with the right capital allocation with the right hurdle. And these are loans that are very high quality that we are willing to put on our balance sheet done with correspondence that we have confidence in the financial status off. Paul Miller : And then some of the rule -- on a follow-up -- some of the rule changes you're seeing coming out of GSEs that try to spur I guess loan demand is you're seeing the GSEs starting to do 3% down payment loans. Is that something that JPMorgan would go down underwritten correctly or is that just too risky? Marianne Lake : So I mean the GSE, you could always get loan up to 97% in the government space because in the agency space with mortgage insurance we've seen some movement from the FHA on GSEs and mortgage insurance payment. All of which I think is intended to try and help credit availability which we would generally support. It doesn't change our strategy, however, which is that we are much more focused on originating in the very high quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. But, yes, probably underwritten we will do agency loans in the programs that they have available. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Marianne, you talked about some of the loan growth that you've experienced and expect to continue to experience and also the driver of the RWA reductions. But can you just help us understand what we should expect from your GAAP balance sheet given that a portion of the RWA reduction sounds like it is coming from runoff? Marianne Lake : Yes, I mean look we have over the last I think two years and a quarter two plus years or so, we've seen an inflow of cash of between $300 billion and $400 billion on our balance sheet. And so our balance sheet size has grown slightly over the course of the last several quarters in the last year. But the vast majority of the growth is driven by incremental cash and there are two principal reasons for that. One is as we have been looking to become compliant with our and with U.S. rules on liquidity which we are compliant with -- and this was happened for a while, but the other is also that we've been receiving increased non operational cash flow and whole supply and so to the degree that cash is accretive from NI perspective and that we on balance sheet or leverage constraint and it is a key part of relationship with that client. That may not be a bad thing. And but to the degree that it is not a key part of the relationship that we are going to be disciplined about trying to manage that balance. So I would say underlying that we would expect our balance sheet to not be growing and certainly not significantly but cash can be the volatile factor. Eric Wasserstrom : Sure. I guess I was thinking about it more from the perspective of the loan portfolio. It sounds like the expectation is --. Marianne Lake : Yes, so we saw loan growth year-over-year 8% gross, 3% reported. We feel pretty good about the demand for loan across our business, particularly those have been performing strongly now consistently like business banking like prime mortgage on the portfolio, commercial real estate even also and we are continue to be optimistic about C&I and even cards. So, yes, we would expect to see robust loan growth into next year and hopefully on the back of a continued improvement in the economy. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. So if I were to summarize all of the guidance that you gave today with those comments, it sounds like the expectation is for modestly higher net interest income, fee income reflecting whatever volatility we suffer from in the capital market space, an absolute decline in operating expense, but likely some increase in the provision. Is that generally correct? Marianne Lake : I do the NI one for you and on the back of robust loan demand and rising rates in the second half of the year which is our current central case and we would expect NI to be up in the second half of the year, flattish in the first half of the year, obviously those two things, if they payout then that wouldn't be the case. And I like you draw your end conclusion on rest of it. Jamie Dimon : You're using the implied curve effectively so that changes and obviously you will expect second half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co. Chris Kotowski : You've been consistent about -- on the issue of dividing the firm up into constituent companies about the strategic benefits of it all, but I wonder if you've done any contingency planning on what if it ever came to the fact that it was too much of a drag to keep it all together? And I guess the question I have is, is it even possible to unscramble the egg and specifically the issue I'm wondering about is you've got over $160 billion of debt at the parent company level. If you were to break the Company up into a consumer bank, a wholesale bank and an asset management business just for argument's sake, is there a way to fairly allocate that debt to the three various lines of business or how would one even go about that? Jamie Dimon : Look the unscrambling, it would be extraordinarily complex. And it would be extraordinarily complex in debt, in systems and technology and people and where certain things go and the businesses would start competing with each other right away which I think is perfectly reasonable if they are all separates in the loan and so look we are very conscious of the narrative which had become out there about this but it is far more complex than that. The right way to look at it as we have this great franchises, we have a lot of time to manage through this. And that is our objective not unscrambling egg. We are going to manage through it and we can manage almost every single part of it over I think over a long period like five or seven years. Don't think of over six months or a year. There is nothing we couldn't settle in it, drive down, sell, manage and that would be probably far easier than the alterative. Even if it led to lower growth but it wouldn't necessarily to lower returns. So just keep in mind that obviously we can do the right things at the end of day for shareholders. It might be lower growth and better returns and managing through then not doing certain things at all. Marianne mentioned for example the amount of deposits we take in. Or it might be that we limit and restrict in our deposit we take at quarter end. We do it accommodate clients but all those non operation deposit will directly into the Federal Reserve. That's what Marianne said. We do it and maybe make some Fed gains 25 basis points there and maybe paying the client something. There are some clients we don't charge to take the quarter end. And they are doing business with us and we don't want their quarter end balances. So we have a lot of leverage, we have a lot of time and we will do it very intelligently over time. Not just damages franchises because of current narrative. And the other thing I want to point out about the current narrative which kind of surprises me that people don't mention, when you all talked about P/Es and some of the parts P/Es are temporary. P/Es change over time and the real question we should asking is, is the E going to be much higher or much lower under scenario A or B not just what the P/E going to be. So that gives a lot of scenario, your Es going to be held lot lower. And that towards the effect of the P/E change. And PE itself is temporary. JPMorgan is already earning, it is across the capital and you compare it to P/Es to lot of cousin who aren't earnings across the capital. I mean people expecting the dramatic growth in earnings which they will. And so you -- it is just-- you really got to have much more forward looking view over P/Es would be, what values would be, what earnings would be, what the franchise would be than just some of the parts breakup based on current P/Es and false comparison. Just some of the people out there feel a comparative, they are not real comparisons. We are not in the same business as those people so but we are sure conscious. It is not to say we are not going to do the right things for shareholders over time. We will, there are other ways to do it. And the other thing which I think is important too is that we compete globally. Remember, we have to be very conscious who we are competing with and what they are going to do over time. And my guess is you can have some very large, very tough global competition over the next 20 years. They are not going to wait, they may have currently lower G50 charges but I am not sure if can be true 10 years from now. Now particularly the Chinese banks get bigger and bigger and some other global competitors decide they wanted to be in there global businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder of Drexel Hamilton. David Hilder : Good morning. Thanks very much. On the question of legal costs, and I realize you'll refresh your disclosure in the 10-K, but can you say anything about whether there are other cases or buckets of cases out there that have the potential to cost $1 billion in any one quarter? Marianne Lake : No. I would refer you to -- I mean if you look at 10-Q from last quarter that would give you a sense for the things that are outstanding. We will obviously update and refresh in the K but I am not going to discuss specifically all of the remaining cases. Jamie Dimon : David, I think again in either way people, I know we know we caused problem if you all because we have just one big quarter by quarter type stuff, I wouldn't look at this is quarter by quarter issue. If you owned a 100% of this company, the better way to look at it is, it is going to cost us several billion dollars more of somehow plus or minus another couple of billion before we get to normal-- what I call normalized legalized basis. We disclosed all that stuff in 10-K. And I think our RPL, if you ask me it is actually fairly decent way to look at what those might be. And we give you an RPL number which is something has not gone to the P&L which possible and we can't make something which is lumpy not lumpy and we can't make something which we can bucket and putting out, if you could we would all the reserves now they were done. We can't. David Hilder : Understood. Thanks very much and for your comments on the -- Jamie Dimon : It is a number and the important part is the shareholder, I want to deal with that acknowledge our mistakes, try to have fortress controlled balance sheet, try to stop stepping and in dog shit which we do every now and then. And build the customer franchise the important part. When you have a market cap of $230 billion, I want to make that worth $500 billion, 10 years from now. The several billion dollars that we are going to have to pay for legal of this-- and we want to fix it. And it is unfortunate we do these to you all but it is unavoidable right now. David Hilder : Right. Well, I would agree with all of that. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Two questions. Marianne, we had some numbers last week that indicated rising delinquency in auto loan portfolios and I think your commentary about your losses this quarter kind of confirm that. Are the numbers right now aberrational or is this a seasoning trend or how do you see this? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I mean I can talk for JPMorgan very specifically that we are seeing the charge-off rate, remember we've had charge-off rates for the auto business that have been relatively low for an extended period and now we are seeing them revert back to something more normal. And when we think about pricing the business and through the cycle, we concentrate on more normal level of charge-off. So this isn't surprising to us. Having said that what we are also seeing in terms of just the broad competitive space is, is not a rationality necessarily but longer duration, higher LTV more sub prime origination. And JPMorgan, we are low LTV than the industry and very concentrated on the near and super prime space. So as a part of that we are just not participating in but even for our own portfolio, you are going to see some of those charge-off rate trends up to something a bit normal but that's how we think about the business through the cycle. Nancy Bush : Do you feel confident that this is not sort of the canary in the coal mine with regard to perhaps other consumer segments? Marianne Lake : I mean I hate to say I'm confident about anything but that's not our expectations Jamie Dimon : Again it is very good question into the full year went into the mortgage thing. We are sub prime was an early indicator freedom prime. But when we look at credit card, we don't think it is early indicator credit card. We will be very conscious. As Marianne said, auto did unbelievably well through the crisis, shockingly well, we will all say so maybe there is return to norm. But we are going to be paying a lot of attention. Marianne Lake : And the lines where origination now that the very further right side of 700 FICO loans with LTV zone and the industry loan is 100%. Nancy Bush : Jamie, one final, hopefully final question on the breakup issue. We all listen to what you say about the strategic value of your businesses and the complementary nature of the businesses, et cetera. And it all sounds very logical. But in Washington, there is still a belief that your company in its present form is a danger to the global financial system. Is there any -- in your view, is there any level of capital that is going to mitigate the too big to fail issue or does it go beyond that? Jamie Dimon : I think, Nancy, views and facts are completely different, okay. This company was a -- what was a port in the storm in the real crisis in 2008 and 2009. And that was after we booked --, we had no issues whatsoever. Okay, we had a lot more capital now, we are more conservative now. We've got less credit exposure to percentage of balance sheet. We got less risk to the percentage of balance sheet, got more long-term debt, we got more liquid assets. We got more -- so it is even more too today. The fact is the company is a powerful thing. People when they talk about risk, they are just talking about stock-- lot of they feel look at the size there, it scares them. I completely understand that. But that isn't the determinant and I don't think we should be making shareholder decision based on views the people don't mess like really no. And so if the regulators then they want JPMorgan to be split up then that's what have to happen. We can't fight this federal government. That's their intend to-- maybe their intend what it is, if you are going to carry more capital, you got a modest value business model over time to carry capital. That one we think that we can earn a superior return still versus other banks and carry the higher capital and modify our business model over time without taking drastic action. And remember, again, you got to look forward in this. America has been the leader in global capital market to the last 50 or 100 years, it is part of the reason the country is so strong. I look as a matter of public policy. I wouldn't want to see the next JPMorgan Chase to be a Chinese company. And because someone is to be serving the global multi national around the world and all the things that mean the knowledge and experience and research and capabilities and so I think if you look ahead 10 years, you are going to have large global companies to compete. And you may have to be slightly small we might otherwise have been so be it. But if you can do that and do it good return for shareholders we should do that. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Marianne, can you tell us -- obviously, you've built up your HQLA in the quarter and your net interest margin came down. How much of the margin pressure was due to the increase in the HQLA? Marianne Lake : So I will tell you that - and to answer the question maybe just slightly differently but with the same basic point that we have -- we added the resorting increasing cash of about $45 billion or little bit more than $45 billion in the quarter and not drove the vast majority of the five to six basis points decline in them. Gerard Cassidy : And are you guys -- I notice that the deposits at the central banks as you pointed out grew very largely in the quarter. Is this a level that now you're satisfied with? And also connected with that, what as outsiders should we look at that will drive the LCR ratio either higher or lower in terms of your calculation that you're going to be doing on a quarterly basis going forward? Marianne Lake : So what it takes, what we have in deposit with the central bank, if any deposits that we have that is excess operating or none operating that we don't think has any significant or any liquidity value to the company. On the whole there is a rule on deposit with central bank and earning a very small amount of interest income, and there are some parts and they try net-net for something slightly accretive. And so that was driving the amount of cash to the degree that we have more non operating cash that would drive that. We complaint with LCR under the U.S. rules with appropriate but modest buffer right now. And that based upon what we think is a fairly forward leaning point of view about what true operating deposit really are. So as we think about what the cashes is in customer's account like really require to operate our businesses and know more. So we think we got a forward leaning point of view on that. So I think the rules for the U.S. final and I think our ratio for U.S. LCR right now will be stable for a period of time. And if there any changes either to the U.S. rule which we don't have any line of sight on or if we are required to make changes or require to make changes to our own internal liquidity framework that could cause us to add liquidity but that's something that will inform you as we go through time. Jamie Dimon : If you look at our balance sheet, okay, we got always real stuff; we have always $500 billion at central bank around the world. We have like $300 billion plus of AA + securities of very short duration. We have like $300 billion of repo on security and stock borrow which is all secured in commodities by top credit with the proper haircut and stuff like that. And with our capital base of equity and capital $200 billion preferred stock of $30 billion TLAC of debt of $150 billion plus, our loan is just $700 billion which probably always been riskiest part of our balance sheet. And it would achieve like  70 and so this balance sheet, this company is unbelievable. Gerard Cassidy : Totally agree. One last thing on those deposits of the central banks, I know some of the big custody banks indicated that they were going to charge their customers that have euro deposits because the ECB is now charging for the deposits at the ECB. Did you guys do that in the quarter and if so how did the customers react when you passed on that cost to them? Marianne Lake : So for Fed institutions and non bank -- for bank and non bank financial institutions, yes, we passed on the over night rate for our customers and it is basically on their operating cash flow. So it is what we are doing is passing through the cost, if operating cash for their business so there was -- Jamie Dimon : In euro. Marianne Lake : Yes, in euro. So there was no significant reaction at all. It is market -- Jamie Dimon : It is very hard; I mean not going to be taking deposit at a loss. That is just very temporary to help our client. So I think everyone understand that. Operator : And there are no other questions. Marianne Lake : Okay. Thank you very much. Jamie Dimon : Bye, thank you very much. Talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you again for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So starting on page one, the Firm reported net income of $5.9 billion for the quarter and EPS of $1.45 a share and the return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of nearly $25 billion up 4% year-on-year reflecting strong performance. The quarter was characterized by constructive environment supporting growth trends and underlying performance. We saw higher levels of volatility and client activity on the back of a number of macro events, driving higher market revenues. We also saw strength across IB fees and core loan growth was strong, up 10% year-on-year. Included in the results was Firmwide legal expense of approximately $500 million after tax; outside of legal, other small and notable items on a net basis did not contribute significantly to the results, which means that a more core earnings number would have been well the other side of $6 billion. Adjusted expense which excludes legal was $14.2 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter with adjusted overhead ratio of 57%. And outside of a modest reserve built oil and gas which I\u2019ll come back to, credit trends remained benign and Firmwide net charge-offs remained low at $1.1 billion. We continued to make progress against our capital targets, reaching Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio of 10.6% while returning over $3 billion to shareholders in the quarter. Finally, we\u2019re pleased that we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board announced its intention to increase the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.44 a share and authorized gross share repurchases of $6.4 billion. Before I move on, you\u2019ll notice, we streamlined our earnings press release for the quarter to simplify the format and focusing on key messages. Skipping over page two, turning to page three on our balance sheet. As I said, the Firm Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio Advanced with 10.6%, up about 45 basis points quarter-on-quarter with earnings model benefit and the combined impact of portfolio run-offs and other RWA reductions being offset by capital distributions. The Fully Phased-In Standardized CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. While we made very good progress during the first quarter, the pace of capital accretion during the year would be linear, particularly given the timing of model benefit. We continue to expect our ratio to be 11% plus or minus at the end of this year. The Firm and the Bank SLR improved slightly from last quarter at 5.7% and 6% respectively. On the next page, on page four, we\u2019ve added a new page on our balance sheet, given the objectives we outlined at Investors Day on non-operating deposits. So, turn to page four. As you look at the balance sheet, it\u2019s important to note both on an average and on a spot basis. You look on the left our average balance sheet is higher by $46 billion which reflects a significant ramp up in deposit in the fourth quarter but if you look next to that, you can see on a spot basis, the March is actually relatively flat to December. And if you move to the right, end of period deposits are also flat quarter-on-quarter but with a relatively significant mix shift towards retail deposits with other deposits down $24 billion, predominantly driven by client actions related to non-operating deposits, reflecting good progress towards our goal and what has effectively been a matter of weeks since Investors Day. We\u2019re actively engaged with our clients and working with them to implement plans to further reduce these deposits and we expect the second quarter to be meaningful in this context. We\u2019re still committed to our goal of reducing them by up to $100 billion by the end of the year. Moving on to NIM and NII, it\u2019s the high average cash balances on deposit growth as well as some asset reductions that drove the 7 basis-point compression in NIM. And in terms of NII, day count was a large driver of the decline. Going to page five on Consumer & Community Banking, the combined consumer business has generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $10.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by healthy growth in balances and in non-interest revenue, partially offset by spread compression. Revenue declined 2% sequentially reported or 4% if you were to exclude the loss in the fourth quarter associated with portfolio exits in card. And this decline is driven by seasonality in NII as well as fewer days in the quarter. We remain focused on the customer experience and on our strong customer satisfaction rankings and we continue to grow households and see very low levels of attrition. And with deepening relationships, our average deposits are now over $0.5 trillion, up 9% year-on-year. We have record client investment assets up 12%. Our active mobile customer base is up 22%; part sales volume up 8% and our overall loan book grew for the third consecutive quarter with core loan growth of 15% year-on-year. And across CCB, we remain disciplined on expense management. Year-on-year expenses were lower by nearly $250 million and our headcount is down about 1,900 so far this year. As you will recall that at Investors Day, we committed to reduce expenses by about $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014. And while it will not be exactly linear, you should assume a meaningful down-payment towards that $2 billion in 2015. Moving to page six, Consumer & Business Banking, CBB generated net income of $828 million for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year and with an ROE of 28%. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers. Average deposit balance growth was up 9%, up $39 billion from last year. And in Business Banking, the momentum we saw in 2014 carried over into 2015 and supported loan originations of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-on-year but with average loan balances up 6% also driven by higher utilization rates. These underlying drivers helped offset the impact of the low rate environment. NII was down 5% quarter-on-quarter, in line with our guidance, on lower deposit margin which was down 12 basis points, driven by lower reinvestment rates as well as day counts. NII while down seasonally quarter-on-quarter was up 5% year-on-year due to strong client investment and debit revenues. Expenses were down 3% year-on-year reflecting continued improvements in branch efficiency. Mortgage Banking on page seven. You will notice we\u2019ve simplified the reporting for Mortgage Banking here; it\u2019s now consistent with the other CCB lines of business. But the additional detail by sub line of business is still available in our earnings supplement. So, overall, net income was $326 million for the quarter. Originations were strong at $25 billion, up 7% quarter-on-quarter as we maintained share in a larger market and realized higher revenue margins. And we added $15 billion of high quality loans in the quarter to our balance sheet, driving slightly higher NII quarter-on-quarter despite fewer days. Although production was higher, our total revenue declined quarter-on-quarter on lower repurchase benefit and lower servicing revenue. Expense of $1.2 billion was down 6% quarter-on-quarter and down 13% year-on-year. But excluding legal would have been down 19% year-on-year over a $0.25 billion despite higher volumes as we continue to tightly control our costs. On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and released a $100 million of NCI reserve this quarter. And you can see the net charge-off rate of 30 basis points was down 25 basis points year-on-year. Moving on to Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, net income of $1.1 billion down 3% year-on-year with an ROE of 22%; when excluding reserve releases, net income was up 11%. In the quarter, we moved our commercial card loans to the CIB to align with the client relationship. This was a $1.3 billion reduction in card loan balances and relatively modest impact of less than $50 million on each of revenue and expense. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year with the card revenue rate of 12.2% in line with guidance on solid sales growth and reflecting continued investments in acquisition. And in auto, we saw solid loan and lease growth partly offset by spread compression. Expense was up 2% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation. In card, we saw end of period loan growth of $3 billion excluding the commercial card transfer I just mentioned and we saw sales growth of 8%. This sales growth is lower than recent growth rate which has typically been in the double-digit, reflecting the impact of lower gas prices estimated to be about 200 basis points as well as generally competitive environment. In commerce solutions were gaining share; volume was up 30% year-on-year driven by continued strong spend as well as the addition of new merchants. In auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car value. It was a 14th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 6% year-on-year. Year-to-date the pipeline remains healthy, reflecting continued strength in the market as well as the strength of our manufacturing partners. Finally on credit card, delinquency rate and net charge-offs remained low. On page nine, the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.6 billion and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year as market conditions in the quarter benefited, both investment banking and market, and our businesses performed well. In banking, our IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 22% year-on-year. We continue to rank number one in Global IB fees with 8.6% share, up 100 basis points since last year. Advisory fees were up 42% which was a strong start for both JPMorgan as well as the market with some large transactions. In fact, this is our highest first quarter on record and we saw share gains of 150 basis points. Debt underwriting fees were up 16%, driven by acquisition financing; aside from that, debt issuance was generally lower and equity underwriting fees were up 13% in a market that was up only 4%. Our wallet ranked improved to number one, both globally and in the U.S. Looking forward for IB fees, we have some notable large transaction in the first quarter and so we do expect the second quarter to be lower, although our pipeline remains strong. Treasury services revenue of $1 billion was down 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower deposit NII and lower trade finance revenue. And lending revenue was $353 million, up 9%, given dividend on restructured securities. Moving on to markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, but if you exclude business simplification, both total markets as well as fixed income market would have been up 20%. A number of macro events occurred in the quarter including central bank actions, the Swiss Bank decoupling, stronger dollar and oil price volatility which supported market performance broadly and currencies, emerging markets, rates, commodities and equity. In fact, equity had one of its strongest quarters, up 22% with strengths in derivatives and cash, in particular across the U.S. and Asia. The first half of the quarter was particularly strong. The market has absorbed a number of macro events at this point and recent sentiment is that the Fed will act later rather than same as this year. As a result, while we are still seeing good client flow and volatility is also elevated, it is somewhat lower coming into the second quarter. With respect to business simplification, in the second quarter, it will have an overall neutral impact to our P&L but will have or drive $300 million decline year-on-year in revenue with a $300 million offset in lower expenses. Securities services revenue, $934 million was down 9% year-on-year, driven by two factors : First, the impact of change in presentation, supply and revenue sharing agreements in our ADR issuance business. Effective this quarter these pass-through payment declines will be treated as a reduction of revenue having formally been treated as an expense but with no P&L impact. Second, at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, there was a significant client exit and the revenue impact of this is reflected in this quarter\u2019s result. For the remainder of 2015, given those two facts, we expect securities services revenue to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion a quarter, depending on seasonality. Lastly on expense, total expense was $5.7 billion, up 1% year-on-year, with the comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter, flat year-over-year, and an overhead ratio of 59%. Non-compensation expense declined due to business simplification, partially offset by higher legal expense year-over-year. Moving on page t 10 on the Commercial Banks, it was a strong quarter with respect to the underlying fundamentals in this business, another record quarter for investment banking revenue with gross revenues of over $750 million. In absolute dollars, it was our strongest quarter ever for loan growth, adding over $5 billion in loans across C&I and CRE and resolved the utilization with asset highest level since 2009. Credit quality remained exceptional with continued low net charge-offs of only 3 basis points. So overall, financial performance for the quarter was solid; net income was $600 million, on $1.7 billion of revenue and an ROE of 17%. Revenue increased 4% year-on-year driven by record investment banking revenue which was up nearly 70%, on increased equity underwriting and M&A activity was partially offset by continued yield compression. Expenses increased 3% year-on-year as we continued to invest in controls but our overhead ratio was consistent with the prior year. We\u2019re reaching a peak in control cost in this business and you should expect expenses to stabilize from here. Loan balances increased 11% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans grew 4% sequentially in line with the industry, driven by higher utilization in our corporate client banking book. And in CRE, loan growth was 3% continuing exceed the industry on strong activity in both multi-family lending as well as real estate banking. Finally on credit and reserve, for the full Firm, we added a little over a $100 million to reserve relating to oil and gas exposure this quarter, majority of which was here in the commercial banking. We review our energy exposure on a name-by-name basis and under a range of commodity price assumptions. This quarter\u2019s reserve build was at downgrade in the E&P portfolio and if the current price environment continues, it\u2019s reasonable to expect some further reserve builds during 2015 but relatively modest. However, in the context of a funded portfolio of $15 billion, this is a very modest build and is fully within the range of our expectations at this part of a cycle for energy. And although we\u2019re taking reserves, it is not clear that it will translate into credit losses as the industry and our clients are not standing still but actively working to manage liquidity and leverage in the face of lower prices. Moving to page 11 and asset management : A good quarter in asset management; net income of $500 million and ROE of 22% and 27% pretax margin on $3 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year driven by flows and higher banking balances. And expense of $2.2 billion was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments in infrastructure and controls and including modest legal expenses. This marked the 24th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows of $16 billion driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion, up 7% year-over-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion. This strengthened multi-asset and equity flows. In banking, we reported strong balances in both lending and deposits. Average loan balances were up 8% year-on-year and average deposits up 6%. And we reported strong investment performance with 79% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second cortiles over five years. Turning to Corporate and turning to page 12, Treasury & CIO reported a net loss of $221 million, but the result included a loss in the quarter of $173 million pre-tax primarily due to a timing impact of cost associated with certain non-operating deposits we planned to exit. On Other Corporate, as we\u2019ve completed the spin-off of OEP and other portfolio sales during the first quarter, the remaining private equity business is not expected to be a significant contributor to the Firm\u2019s earnings. Therefore beginning this quarter and going forward, we will be disclosing our corporate private equity results as a part of Other Corporate. This quarter private equity contributed a modest positive to the results. Also including the results for Other Corporate was $300 million pretax of legal expense which is largely offset by a $177 million of net income on tax items. Moving to page 13 and the outlook, I\u2019ve addressed most of this guidance through the presentation; I just want to highlight a couple of items : First, in CCB and the consumer businesses a couple of geography points relative to analyst models. We guided in the fourth quarter to expect the first quarter\u2019s consumer bank revenues to be down on deposit margin compression; we saw that this quarter as expected and we expect deposit margins to remain impressive as rates remain low. In the mortgage bank at Investor Day, we guided for revenues to be down approximately $1 billion for the year on lower servicing revenues as well as lower repurchase benefit. We saw some of that this quarter and that guidance remains. Against that, as I said earlier, across CCB, we do expect to deliver a meaningful portion of the $2 billion expense reduction guidance in 2015. Finally on this page asset management for the full year, expect the pretax margin and ROE to be at the low end of through the cycle target range. So, wrapping up, a strong result for the quarter in a consecutive environment, we saw strong market and transaction activity despite continued margin compression. The performance continues to reflect the strength of each of our franchises; strong market revenue and IB fees; 9% growth in retail deposit; 10% core loan growth and good progress against our capital, our balance sheet and our expense commitment. With that operator, please can you open up the line to questions? Operator : And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just one quick clarification question on the performance and actually, this was great. You mentioned pretty much across the board. Do you think there is any seasonality; any one-time events; block trades, anything like that that would lift such good performance in the quarter? Marianne Lake : It wasn\u2019t anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events; it was really quite broad, particularly in derivatives and cash. The performance was I would say solid year-over-year because we saw strength in the America this year but we had strength in Europe last year. And I think the first quarter 2014 wasn\u2019t particularly strong, so I think we were flatten a little bit with a relative comparison but it was a really strong absolute and we think strong relative performance. Glenn Schorr : And maybe just a related question but I\u2019m not sure which line it would flow through. For my understanding, you guys and others have been pushing or talking with prime brokerage clients to help improve our ROEs in the business. Is part of that following through and just better equity performance, more business with clients? Marianne Lake : Yes, this is where it would be. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a driver but we are as we said and the whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of balance sheet and improve return. So we think some of that, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was a key driver. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Switching gears, in Jamie\u2019s letter, you talked about -- mentioned the need to push the new G-SIB rules to the product and the client level. And it piqued my curiosity. And I am just curious, how different is that from what you have already done? In other words, each step of the way you have been early and adapting and pushing out to the desk level. How your capital charge is? Is this just meaning more of the same, meaning higher capital charge, higher capital charge or is this something different there that you need to do? Marianne Lake : No, I mean, it is more of the same. Obviously G-SIB took on a slightly heightened focus when we had some doubling happen in the proposal in December. So, we\u2019ve always been measuring and monitoring and tracking G-SIB at a very granular level but we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it, which means that we are going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint and uniquely also with advanced capital standardized limit balance sheet caps; the like. So, it\u2019s more of the same honestly than just a heightened focus on this, given the U.S. proposal and given the impact of at least at this point, FX translation. Jamie Dimon : And different than RWA, it affects certain products more than others and we pointed non-operating deposits, stuff like that; certain businesses more knows, we\u2019ve pointed out clearing and certain clients more than others, we\u2019ve pointed out financial institutions. So, just kind of a multivariant theme; it\u2019s not mystical. And we are actually already planning to re-price some of these businesses to get an adequate return on use of capital and we\u2019re seeing other people do that. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s right. I mean we maybe in a different position with G-SIB but others are leverage constraint. And just generally speaking, we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet and pricing is following somewhat generally. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : I was wondering on net interest income, given outlook for how the net interest income dollars could trend from here, assuming that you don\u2019t get much help from higher rates, what are the key drivers and what\u2019s kind of your outlook for NIM and NII dollars for the year? Marianne Lake : So, again assuming for a second that rates don\u2019t rise into the backend -- at the end of the year, I mean come back to that if you look, we would expect our NII dollars to be stable to slightly up because we\u2019re still seeing growth in our interest earning assets. Obviously this quarter, we were down some on day count; it was a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction. So, we\u2019re really going to see the biggest lift in NII when we do see rates rise, we see when that is. And similarly on our NIM, we would expect NIM to be stable, particularly given as we talked about what we\u2019re seeing early on NIM, more particularly over the course of the last year or two have been this significant increase in cash and we\u2019re going to see some of that, at least stabilizing term as we start to reduce our non-operating deposits and we should see our NIM relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your next question; it comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. On the CCAR, do you expect any potential surcharges on the CCAR to come out when the U.S. final rules on SIFI buffers come out? And in addition to that, have you learned anything from the CCAR in terms of the transparency of the process; is there progression in terms of the back and forth of the regulators as either through the CCAR process and their expectations? Marianne Lake : So taking your first point Erika, obviously I don\u2019t know the next time we\u2019re going to and will likely get CCAR instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be sometime towards the end of this year for the next CCAR cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. So all I can say is what you know which is clearly the door was left opened for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of the surcharge. We are hopeful that that won\u2019t be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in stress and to have all firms to end up well capitalized afterwards but have no more insights than that for you. With respect to the dialogue with the Fed, it\u2019s definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and three years ago and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversations and it\u2019s constructive. I don\u2019t think however you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by designs in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what theirs results are driven by. So, I won\u2019t be able to clarify for you what changed in there is also what this is between us and theirs but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: The drop in the adjusted expense is I think about 3% year-over-year, came in little bit better than we were thinking while revenues were also little bit better. Obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of cost saving programs underway that you mentioned earlier on the call and at Investor Day. But should we think that maybe you are running ahead of schedule or that the cost saves could be more or is it just lumpiness as we go quarter-over-quarter? Marianne Lake : I think the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance of adjusted expenses being $57 billion plus or minus by the end of the year or for the year, sorry. Obviously we will always try and outperform that but I wouldn\u2019t characterize one quarter as a change in our guidance at this point. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then just separately, obviously a big company out there announced its exiting most of its banking assets and just wondering if there is any interest or appetite within your commercial bank to bulk up the acquisition there in terms of the asset purchases versus the complete company? Marianne Lake : I mean the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that\u2019s the most important thing about that transaction for us. I am not going to comment specifically on whether or what JPMorgan will be interested in terms of asset purchases. We are much more focused on partnering strategically with the company. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Chris Spahr : Hi, this is Chris Spahr on behalf of Mike Mayo. I just had a question relating to your CET1 ratio guidance. Do you give any kind of guidance on the Tier 1 leverage by -- ratio by the end of this year given your CET1 of 11%? Marianne Lake : No, we haven\u2019t given any specific guidance Chris. Chris Spahr : Do you think there is any way you will be able to manage that ratio higher in the context of this year\u2019s CCAR? Marianne Lake : In the context of the CCAR we just had? Chris Spahr : Yes. Marianne Lake : We expect our -- it\u2019s little complicated this year and we sort of articulated at Investor Day because we\u2019re going to move at some point whether it\u2019s a third or fourth quarter to have standardized the RWA be our binding constraint. So, 11% plus or minus is our target on CET1 and that\u2019s what we said. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Marianne, you mentioned that treasury service revenues were down due to the trade finance revenue area. And I noticed on the balance sheet that trade finance outstandings have dropped meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us what\u2019s going on in that line of business? Marianne Lake : There is a couple of different things, one was a little specific. We had a portfolio of loans that we held for sale and subsequently exit from the balance sheet which drive some of it, but in addition to generally a competitive environment and lower demand particularly in Asia. Gerard Cassidy : And then second, you mentioned that you obviously had a very strong advisory business in the quarter and you gained market share of 150 basis points. Do you have any sense of who you took the market share from; was it European investment banks or U.S.? Marianne Lake : Not specifically; I will tell you that while we\u2019re obviously delighted with the performance, it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions. So, we\u2019re happy with the gains but I can\u2019t specifically comment on where it came from. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : I just wanted to follow-up on your energy comments. Could you help us understand what events it was that led to reserve building; was it company specific events in the form of bankruptcies or just something else in your internal ratings migration? Marianne Lake : Yes, it\u2019s definitely moving assets. So basically, if you think about the E&P portfolio in particular when we think about the redetermination somewhat semiannually of the borrowing base and look those companies on a client specific name-by-name basis and with some contraction in the borrowing base networks and downgrades that drive our reserving methodology; it doesn\u2019t mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty, but that\u2019s the way the reserving methodology works. And as I said, we do this on a client-by-client basis. We\u2019re comfortable with our exposures and clients looking to manage their own defensive position. So, it\u2019s not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses, in fact it\u2019s implied curve rather than flat to long order prices is in fact how things play out, it\u2019s possible that there will be very little in a way of credit loss we\u2019d assume. Eric Wasserstrom0 : And just on the last point, your view on that is because of recovery in prices rather than restructuring actions or things that your clients are undertaking; is that fair or is it bit of a \u2026? Marianne Lake : Both. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I just wanted to see if I could just follow-up on the energy point. Obviously you have the reserving and then you mentioned the 200 basis-point impact on spend. I am wondering if you just expand the discussion of energy; are there positive offsets that you\u2019re starting to see in the businesses elsewhere either in terms of whether it\u2019s credit or borrowing or investment banking opportunities that maybe popping up? How do you -- can you summarize the benefit if at this point you can see any positive offsets? Marianne Lake : First of all just on the contraction in spend given volatile prices, it\u2019s pretty typical in this part of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up and you see consumer spend for the energy dividend so to speak lag back. So it\u2019s the fact that we saw that happen in the first quarter; it\u2019s not atypical and it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate into high spend also; it\u2019s more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation. But with respect to other activity -- yes, we saw active equity capital markets with defensive -- some defensive issuance and generally I think it\u2019s a positive overall for the businesses and for the economy. Ken Usdin : And my follow-up question is just with respect to the security services business, you mentioned the change in presentation and then there was the client loss. Is there a way you can help us understand just what the organic growth rate of the businesses adjusted for the reclassification, just whether it\u2019s on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis? Marianne Lake : Not readily, but we can get back to you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just talk, go back to the capital ratio issue for a second. You noted that standardized your 10.8 and then you still feel that will be your constraining factor by the end of this year. So if you\u2019re already at 10.8, your target is 11; I know it\u2019s plus or minus, but it does seem like maybe you got three quarters and 20 basis points. So, is there anything unusual you\u2019re expecting in the coming quarters or is it just, hey, you can never know quarter-to-quarter, but all else being equal, looks like you can probably hit 11 if not better; is that a fair way to think about it? Marianne Lake : Yes, nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year and we should hit 11 if not a little better, yes. Jim Mitchell : And as you look at the surcharge, the G-SIB surcharge more, the proposals, do you feel better or worse; you feel -- is there any areas where you think you can pull the lever more significantly to improve that ratio or lower the charge? Marianne Lake : I would say seven weeks or six weeks whatever it is, after Investor Day that the messaging hasn\u2019t really change which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing as we talked about earlier in a very granular way. And we\u2019re already working on that. And you see that in the most obvious state which is in reduction already to-date in non-operating deposit. But we continue to work on all of the things, so derivative notional compression, level three assets, financing and obviously we\u2019re still thinking about what the response should be in terms of risk intermediation or clearing. And so I think six weeks on from Investor Day, the story is the same. We feel we are fully committed to ensuring that we are closely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop that but we\u2019re only a few months into this. Operator : You have a question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Marianne, going back to the reserve build which obviously was done for the oil and gas as you mentioned, can you share with us, in the corporate and investment bank, I know on a total dollar amount relative to the corporation, it\u2019s not significant, but there is a big increase in the non-accrual loans from 110 to 251 in the quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would -- obviously, you noted it\u2019s from a small base, so that\u2019s notable. There are two specific exposures that were moved for non-accrual. One of them was moved on a somewhat of a technicality, sovereign downgrade which we fully expect to recover on but that\u2019s just the way we have to present it; and other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure. So, I wouldn\u2019t over think it right now; it\u2019s two exposures and it\u2019s $200 million. Gerard Cassidy : And that was not oil and gas related obviously, it\u2019s in the CIB area that was in the commercial bank? Marianne Lake : The first, the sovereign downgrade was -- did have oil and gas underlying exposure but again it was on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the company. And we fully expect to recover on that. Jamie Dimon : But focus on the very, very smaller number. Operator : Your next question is from line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : You highlighted the Swiss franc as a tailwind for FICC. Could you maybe size that for us? Marianne Lake : No, I will just say overall our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event we happened to be able to benefit from it; some others will be neutral and some may have lost that. So these things happen regular way in trading businesses and it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility it drove is good for us and our franchise. And I think it\u2019s fair to show you that we\u2019re in a business where expertise matters and risk decision matters and we were able to capitalize on both of those, not just for the Swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter. Brennan Hawken : Sure, I know that the higher volatility of course would drive higher volume. I was just talking about the event specifically and if there was some one-time gains involved in that so that we can kind of adjust for a core figure here? Marianne Lake : No I wouldn\u2019t characterize in this one-time gain; I would categorize in this one of a number of items that drove our performance in the business. Brennan Hawken : And then on the energy front, a lot of the focus was on the CB and the energy exposure there but you all mentioned that there is exposures in CIB too. Can you give us maybe an update if there was any changes in any of those exposures or loans this quarter? Marianne Lake : I mean overall in the total Firm, the reserve built that we took was a little over $100 billion four-fifth of which was in the commercial bank. So, we did experience; we do all of this on a name by name basis, so we did across our portfolios but the majority was in the CB E&P portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller : On your deposit discussion about pushing out, I think you said during your Investors Day that you\u2019d like to get about $3 billion of the non-core deposits off the balance sheet. And I know you said that you hope to make progress in the second quarter. How should we model that out and what type of benefit have you modeled out to the NIM with that $3 billion of deposits? Jamie Dimon : It was $100. Paul Miller : $100 billion, I am sorry. Marianne Lake : No worries, $100 billion. I mean look at the end of the day you can see that over the course of the last -- since over the third quarter of 2012, our cash balances grew by couple of hundred billion dollars and that has been a very large contributor for the compression in our NIM, not the only one. So as we push out the non-operating deposits, we would expect to see that help but remember we\u2019re still growing retail deposits. So if you look at this quarter in particular, even though we reduced our non-op deposits related to client actions by about $20 billion and the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposit. So, we\u2019re continuing to grow the good retail deposit. So I would say it would be a tailwind but it will be a tailwind for stabilizing and slightly improving NIM outside of rate rises. Paul Miller : And then real quick on your professional services, professional services was down like from $2 billion to $1.6 billion. Is that mainly due to some of that legal cost maybe starting to go away from the crisis? Marianne Lake : I am sorry, off the top of my head, I can\u2019t remember the number you are saying. But no, our legal expenses; forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we\u2019ve taken and the settlements that we reached. Regular way, expense for third parties in legal isn\u2019t down substantially quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year just although at some point it will be. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak : Marianne, I was hoping that we could dig into the RWA progress that we saw in the quarter. And specifically I was hoping that you could just aggregate how much of the sequential decline that we saw was a function of the planned mitigation actions and model benefits that you\u2019ve cited versus actual FX driven declines? Because assuming that the U.S. dollar strength persists all else equal, one could surmise that we should expect RWAs in a long-term context actually coming out below that $1.5 trillion target that you\u2019ve cited in the past? Marianne Lake : So, specifically with respect to the quarter, I would say that the wholesale parameter update -- our wholesale credit parameter update model benefit is up about a half of the RWA reduction with the other half coming from regular way portfolio run-off as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions; reductions in private equity; reductions in commitment systems, some position in reductions rather than driven specifically by FX. We\u2019re running above $1.5 trillion now. And we said we\u2019re going to manage both the advance and standardize to that number over the course of next couple of years. So, its FX -- its currency translation is at tailwinds and we would hope to do better but at this point, let\u2019s get there. Steven Chubak : And another question on capital but relating to CCAR, Marianne you\u2019ve noted on this call and in the past that you don\u2019t expect CCAR to be JPMorgan\u2019s binding constraint longer term. But just given the reduction that we saw and that ask [ph] or the need use the mulligan in the last exam; I was just hoping you could cite some of the plan mitigation actions that you expect to pick so that we could see you guys get on the path towards delivering on that 55% to 75% net pay out target. Marianne Lake : At the moment, CET1 ratio launching into CCAR was 10% or below 10%, not the 12% that we expect to run out when once we build our capital to our target level. So you are right that right now on the CCAR, Tier 1 leverage was our binding constrain, both last year and this year. So a combination of our capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferred together with balance sheet actions will be how we think about mitigating that limitation in medium term. But ultimately it doesn\u2019t change the fact that once we get to our target assuming that is the 12% that we articulated at Investor Day, but again we don\u2019t think we should be leveraged constrained. So we\u2019re going to work on that obviously and we\u2019re continuing to build capital but when we launched into CCAR, we won at that level. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Nancy Bush : Jamie, you warned in your annual letter about the possibility of another flash crash. Yesterday, I think Simon Potter at the Fed warned about it and cited HFT is one of the issues. Larry Summers warned about it about a week ago. Are these warnings going anywhere; I mean are they being translated into action anywhere in the system? Jamie Dimon : To give it a little perspective, I also spoke in that the banking system is much stronger to start with and every bank in the system is much stronger. So just trying to think through what are the effects of some of these things. And we look at that kind of a warning shot across the bow. What I would worry about more is what happens in a stressed environment. I think people are paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the markets and there has to be changes down the road; there might be some changes that are relevant to that. Nancy Bush : Secondly Marianne, a question about commercial banking; the returns in commercial banking have remained in sort of the high teens over the last number of quarters then it\u2019s certainly respectable sort of 17% to 19%. Is there anyway those returns improve materially or as rates go up or does that get offset by competitive factors? And are we at sort of a normalized level for that business? Marianne Lake : The best way to think about that is through the cycle target that those that we Doug Petno put out at Investor Day which is 18%. So that doesn\u2019t mean to say that we won\u2019t benefit when rates rise in this business; it\u2019s very competitive and spreads are compressing and there is a lot of factors going on but through this cycle 18%, so with some years below and some above. The question on core growth and security services outside of presentation changes and client exists is currently in the low single-digit. So obviously a little bit muted because we\u2019re working on balance sheet optimization but certainly growing and in the low single-digit. But in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from, principally European banks. No more questions? Operator : There are no more questions. Marianne Lake : Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation. It\u2019s available on our Web site and please if you could refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. So starting off on Page 1, the Firm delivered strong performance this quarter. Net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.54 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.5 billion. The quarter\u2019s performance was characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses with stable NIM and NII, good growth in fee drive as well as strong IB fees, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter-on-quarter at $14.2 billion and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58% and low levels of charge offs and core loans up 12% year-on-year. We also made significant progress on our balance sheet and we\u2019ve delivered on our non-operating deposit commitment. While there were no significant items this quarter, there were some small items that are worth calling out. On the positive side, we had consumer loan loss reserve releases of a little over $300 million as well as a little under $300 million of a benefit in DVA/FVA on wider spreads. Against that we saw reserve builds across wholesale of $250 million of which approximately $140 million related to oil and gas, as well as Firmwide legal expense of a little less than $300 million. If you take those four items and net them, together they contribute to zero to net income. So finally included in the result is $330 million of a benefit from tax discrete items. If you adjust all of those our net income is strong at $6 billion. Skipping over Page 2, and on to Page 3, we continue to make progress against our capital targets with the Firm\u2019s Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio retain a 11%, up 35 basis points quarter-on-quarter and Standardized Fully Phased-In with a 11.2%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction to risk weighted assets primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data enhancements with loan growth offsetting run off. We continue to build Tier 1 capital adding $3.4 billion of preferred stock this quarter and we return $3.6 billion of net capital to shareholders including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. Preferred issuance together with a reduction in average assets drove the Firm\u2019s SLR to reach 6%. For more details on our balance sheet reduction, turn to Page 4. The last quarter I told you that you should expect us to make meaningful progress on our balance sheet in this quarter and we did just that. Year-to-date our balance sheet is down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our wholesale businesses partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits. We also saw a $36 billion reduction in trading assets and secured financing as we continue to make progress simplifying our balance sheet.  On the previous page you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those lower levels of cash. However, the firm remains LCR compliant, given the significant outflow assumptions that was associated with those deposits. In addition, the reduction in deposits together with strong core loan growth resulted in improved loans deposit ratio, up 5% since year-end. These balance sheet actions translated to relatively flat NIM, up 2 basis points quarter-on-quarter and NII. Quarter-on-quarter the reduction in cash drove a 4 basis point improvement was partially offset by lower yields and as I said, Firm NII was flat. Turning to Page 5 and Consumer & Community Banking. The performance for the combined consumer businesses was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating $2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19% and an overhead ratio of 56%. Revenue of $11 billion was down 4% year-on-year driven by mortgage, but up 3% quarter-on-quarter on seasonally higher credit and debit sales volume as well as higher MSR revenue. Our focus on customer experience continues to drive growth broadly and we\u2019ve 19% core loan growth driven by mortgage. Also our active mobile customer base is up 22% to over 21 million customers and we\u2019re the largest and fastest growing among major U.S banks, reflecting our strategic objective to have a best-in-class mobile offering. We remain focused on our commitment to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014, while continuing to self fund investments in the business. In the first half of this year, expenses were down approximately $0.5 billion versus the same period last year, and our headcount down roughly 6,000 year-to-date. Moving to consumer business banking on Page 6, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter-on-quarter and down 8% year-on-year with an ROE of 28%. Net interest income was flat sequentially with modest spread compression offset by deposit growth and NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year-on-year on continued strong client investment and debit revenue. Expenses were up 1% year-on-year largely due to increased legal costs. Excluding these, expenses were down 2% due to continued improvements in branch efficiency. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers with attrition well below industry averages. Average deposit balances up 9% or $41 billion year-on-year and we\u2019re pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our investments in Business Banking and CPC and new builds. Client investment assets were a record, up 8% to $16 billion and in Business Banking Average loan balances were up 6% with loan originations flat against a record last year and in a highly competitive environment. Stepping back and looking forward to the second half, our NII is stable and will increase when rates rise. Non-interest revenue is growing solidly and expenses will decrease, so we expect positive operating leverage. Mortgage banking on Page 7. Mortgage net income was $584 million for the quarter. Originations were $29 billion, up 19% quarter-on-quarter, on seasonal increases in the purchase market. We continue to execute our strategy of adding high quality loans to our balance sheet. Totally $19 billion this quarter and the origination pipeline continues to look strong. Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue, but as you can see -- you look at our non-interest revenue it\u2019s down $500 million year-on-year. We still expect non-interest revenue to be down about $1 billion for the full-year in line with previous guidance. Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200 million or 15% year-on-year and down 9% quarter-on-quarter despite higher volume as we continue to manage down our costs. On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and as a result we released $300 million of NCI reserve this quarter and you can see our charge-off rate were 21 basis points. Moving on to Page 8, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion, up 30% year-on-year and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year on Card sales volume and Auto loan and lease growth, partially offset by spread compression. The Card revenue rate for the quarter of 12.4% was up quarter-on-quarter seasonally. Expense was down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower legal expense with a recent settlement regarding debt sale and collection practices having previously been reserved. And in Card we saw core loan growth of 3% and sales growth of 7% with delinquency rates and charge-offs remaining low. Commerce Solutions continue to experience strong growth with volumes up 12% year-on-year, driven by continued strong spend and the addition of new merchants. We\u2019ve recently signed several new strategic clients, including Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott and Rite Aid. Together they represent an incremental 5% to our volume and the majority have signed up for ChaseNet. Lastly in Auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 8% year-on-year and the pipeline is healthy. Moving to Page 9 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. So before I dig into the numbers, we did make some reporting changes this quarter. If you look at the top of the table, investment banking fees is now named investment banking revenue and principally this now incorporates the revenue share with the commercial bank here in this line rather than in the market revenues where it was previously being reported. Additionally, trade finance revenue which was previously reported in treasury services is now being reported in lending. So digging into the numbers, the CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion and an ROE of 14%, reflecting a strong result in a mixed environment. In Banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion is up 4% year-on-year. This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap for number two. We ranked number one in fees in North America and EMEA and gained share improving to number two in Asia. Another strong quarter for Advisory, up 17% year-on-year as activity levels remained high. We maintained our number two ranking and grew share by over 100 basis points from last quarter. Equity underwriting fees were down 5% from a strong prior year for IPOs in EMEA with lower wallet share as we gave back some of the outsized share gain we had in the third quarter. This quarter we ranked number two globally with strong performance in the U.S on acquisition finance and follow on. Debt underwriting up 1% and we maintained our number one ranking with strength in high grades also on the back of the healthy M&A market. Treasury services was down 2% year-on-year on lower net interest income and the lending item of $302 million was down 32% year-on-year primarily driven by losses on restructured securities. Given the reporting changes we\u2019ve made going forward, we should expect that for treasury services revenues would be about $875 million plus or minus per quarter and lending approximately $350 million and that\u2019s given the trade finance transfer. Moving on to markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year-on-year, excluding business simplification and the gain in the prior year on the IPO of market which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance and rates and in equity markets. Fixed-income revenue was $2.9 billion down 10% year-on-year similarly adjusted. In macro products, the quarter was dominated by EMEA with a bond sell off and economic and political uncertainty including Greece. This uncertainty slowed the momentum we saw in the first quarter and kept clients from the sidelines in currencies in emerging market, but drove strong performance in rates. Credit and Securitized products were down on a continuation of general weakness in the market. And as I mentioned, equity market had another strong quarter, up 27% year-on-year on revenue of $1.6 billion with strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong Kong on the back of client interests first to participate in the rally and later to hedge. Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year-on-year in third-quarter markets revenues with a corresponding decline in expenses. And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our markets results this quarter you have revenues in markets going up sequentially. We\u2019re fully expecting to see normal seasonal declines in the third quarter markets revenues. Security service revenues of $1 billion was in line with guidance, up seasonally on the European dividend season. And moving on to expense -- total expense was down 15% year-on-year at $5.1 billion and an overhead ratio of 59% and we successfully executed the expense reduction associated with business simplification and with lower legal expense. Compensation expense down 4% year-on-year comped a revenue ratio for the second quarter 30% flat year-on-year. Moving on to the Commercial Bank. In commercial Banking the underlying businesses continue to perform well with strong loan growth, up $6 billion quarter-on-quarter and record end of period loan balances with good credit fundamentals and low non-performing loans. We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last quarter which was driven by a large transaction. However, we added $187 million to reserves in the quarter reflecting the select downgrades including oil and gas. Despite this, BAU credit performance at the portfolio as I said remained very strong. This drove net income of $525 million on revenue of $1.7 billion and an ROE of 14%. Revenue was flat year-on-year driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits, partially offset by growth in loans and flat sequentially despite the record investment banking performance in the first quarter. Expenses were up 4% year-on-year on increased control related staffing and down slightly quarter-on-quarter. For the rest of the year for each quarter, we expect expenses to remain around $720 million. Loan balances increased 12% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans grew 3% sequentially in line with the industry with middle market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition, but with more strength in corporate client banking, driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base. CRE loans grew 5% and continue to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had record originations in the quarter and in real estate banking. Moving on to Page 11 and Asset Management, net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion, reflected solid growth up 6% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter. Driven by continued net long term inflows marking the 25th consecutive quarter at $13 billion with strength in North America and multi-asset flows, driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 4% year-on-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion. In addition, we have record loan balances which were up 9% year-on-year. Expense of $2.4 billion was up 17% year-on-year, primarily driven by legal expense and to a lesser extent the impact of moving an asset to held-for-sale. Adjusting for those two items, expense would have been up more in line with revenue and margins in line with our targets. Lastly, we reported strong investment performance with 78% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.  Turning to Page 12 and Corporate, Treasury & CIO reported a net loss of a little over $100 million, and other corporate reported net income of $552 million which included a benefit on discrete tax items I previously mentioned. So on Page 13 is our outlook page, any guidance that I was going to gave I made through the presentation, the page is here for your reference. So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses and an environment that continue to remain somewhat challenging with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet and expense commitments. So with that, operator we will open up the line now for Q&A. Operator : Great. And your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake : Hi, Erika. Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question is the capital progress has clearly been solid this quarter. Last week, however, there seems to have been more support in the Fed in terms of including the SIFI surcharge in the CCAR test. And I guess the question is in two parts : one, what do you think the chances are of the -- any or all of the CCAR surcharge or the CET1 surcharge to be included in CCAR; and two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments, if that did pass? Marianne Lake : So to do -- obviously, we don't have any particular insights. I think the comments you are referring to comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of, and really that -- it hasn't changed relative to previous comments and the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further information and so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge. So we are just going to have to, I suppose, wait and see. Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, it happens for us, it happens for everyone and we\u2019ve shown you before not that -- good outcome, but we\u2019ve shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. And so if everybody have to increase their minimums, it's going to be a similar position for everyone. Meanwhile, we are continuing to execute on everything that we have already told you we are going to do to optimize our capital. And our commitment is to go to firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge and if we believe we can do it and it\u2019s economic and it\u2019s not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. So we will respond when we see the rules and we're not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just the second question is you\u2019ve clearly made also progress in terms of your deposit mix. As we potentially anticipate a rising rate environment for the back half of the year, given what the regulators have done in terms of saying, okay, here are the good deposits, here are the not so good deposits, how should we expect the pace and magnitude of retail deposit repricing or pass-through if the Fed does raise rates in the second half of this year? Marianne Lake : So we actually haven\u2019t really changed our point of view since Investor Day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit and there are other people who have slightly different views, but we are expecting retail deposit to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition so good high quality LTR compliant retail deposit, given the advancements in mobile banking, given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates. So when we think about our sensitivity and our reprice, we model it in assumption that it\u2019s going to be higher -- somewhat higher. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Mike. Jamie Dimon : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : I see your markets revenue are down 1% year-over-year the way you look at this, but I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with Jamie\u2019s comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there is repricing in rates, derivatives, prime brokerage clearing and trade finance. I\u2019m guessing its just risk off. So can you shed more light on what type of repricing you\u2019re seeing with any specific examples, because the transparency for us on the outside is pretty weak? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So obviously when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter, you don\u2019t always -- you don't know the exact number. And repricing is a complex issue. I mean, I just give you some very specific things and I will tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up. Clearing, we definitely seeing people start to charge for clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25, 50 basis points. It is a small business. I don\u2019t think it's going to dramatically affect those lines. Prime broker, we have seen similar type of thing. Repo there seem that people are charging pretty much for repo, we need to get a return on it. Exotic derivatives, which are again very small of being repriced to, I would say, full capital and liquidity. Muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit against the small market. If you go to credit and trading, so credit we are really not seeing any repricing effectively in commercial credit. You\u2019re seeing a little bit mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. You\u2019ve seen a little bit in auto, got more aggressive not less aggressive, so trade finance you\u2019ve seen a little bit of repricing and I know these are not all trading numbers. What you don\u2019t see, Mike, is that in a lot of cases, when you may reprice a little bit, you\u2019re also sharing business so that you have -- so you are protecting your margins by because AML cost your -- you\u2019re not do certain types of business anymore. An FHA the lifetime cost of servicing, you cut back on FHA volumes etcetera. So you're protecting your margins, but you're actually shrinking your revenue in some cases. That's happening a little bit in clearing in prime broker and stuff like that. You want your best clients. In other categories, clients are like deposits we haven't seen repricing effectively. I don\u2019t think of non-operating deposits. On the other hand, some clients are saying lets restructure relationship to make more sense for you JPMorgan and I\u2019m willing to give you other business, which is not credit sensitive etcetera. So it's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return to your capital not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line-item. It\u2019s very easy to show revenue growth. Mike Mayo : And just one follow-up. When you think \u2026 Jamie Dimon : I think mostly what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related et cetera. And even in trading, spreads are narrow, but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gap out pretty quickly which eventually could be good for trading. So it's unclear. Mike Mayo : So when you say a little repricing, I mean, is it bigger than a breadbox? I mean, is this -- are we talking about basis points or 1% or 5%, what you're talking about here? Jamie Dimon : I'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15, 10. That's all we need is some of these things get a adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Question on the deposit shrinkage. You obviously finished the program you announced at Investor Day. Just wondering if you're going to take it further what the impact on revenues has been and do you expect that the full benefit to NIM is already in 2Q or -- in the 2Q numbers we\u2019re going to see more benefit in 3Q from the actions you took? Marianne Lake : So -- hi Betsy. So what I said and hopefully it was clear is that we actually exceeded our commitments, so we actually shrunk our non-operating deposit by more than $100 billion and not just grew our consumer deposit, but we are also able to grow also operating deposit. So we had a good mix shift both in consumer versus wholesale, but also within wholesale. And so we feel very great about that. There are two priorities off that. The first is protecting that position to making sure that we\u2019re able to not have inflows of those deposit size as the industry continues to absorb them. But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but if we get harder and harder, each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned operating accounts in operating business and we have always said that we want to do this for the right reason for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that its going to materially harm our clients. So that's the lens \u2026 Jamie Dimon : And the parts also we made in level 3 assets, derivate receivables, certain balance sheet items, RWA, so the efforts are optimized, the balance sheet for G-SIFI etcetera is not going to stop. That we\u2019re going to continue to do. Marianne Lake : But its not -- I don\u2019t anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. We\u2019ve already done a little better. We will continue to try and do a little better. In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis than on an average basis, but the equation looking forward will be much the same as said at Investor Day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for half a year, but that would be some expense benefit on FDIC cost etcetera, so not a very big number. I think that was the question? Betsy Graseck : Yes and the NIM benefit should flow into 3Q as well? Marianne Lake : Little bit, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us about the timing of your expense reduction targets in the Consumer and Investment Bank, specifically if you read the $57 billion in adjusted expenses for \u201915, how much of the ultimate cost saves does that $57 billion target for this year in Corporate? How much would you have achieved already in \u201915 and any thoughts on the trajectory for remaining saves after this year? Marianne Lake : Yes, so let me do this in two parts and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well low on our way to delivering against, the commitment $2 billion in \u201917 versus \u201914 and its not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time and if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion. So that gives you a sense where how we\u2019re tracking. On the CIB, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer at Investor Day this year 2.8 billion in \u201917 versus \u201914. I would characterize that in sort of two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. The majority of business simplification not all, but the majority will come out of our run rate in 2015 and we\u2019ve already seen that in the first and second quarter when you\u2019re seeing the $300 million, $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business simplification. The other $1.3 billion which is all the reductions in technology and operations and headcount is going to be things. We are working on it actively. We have programs, we have people, but it's going to be more of a 2016 and \u201917 benefit. So if I have to look at the first half of \u201915 versus the first half of \u201914, take the 500 in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space, that\u2019s probably the right way to size it about a quarter so far this year. John McDonald : A quarter of the total? Marianne Lake : Yes. John McDonald : Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up is on RWA. Any update to your year-end RWA targets and thoughts about how we should think about potential RWA levels longer-term? Marianne Lake : So RWA, advance RWA is down $36 billion, $37 billion, 1536 we said a little greater than 1.5, we're still in track to be 1.5 or a little greater 1.5 advanced at the end of the year. Standardized right now is at 1.5, so pretty close to 1.5 trillion, again, the target at the end of the year 1.55. So that\u2019s a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have somewhat put pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that we\u2019re growing. And so if you look to our Investor Day targets, we\u2019re still hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately 1.5 through time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Matt Burnell : Good morning. I\u2019m just curious in terms of your core loan growth. You mentioned that that\u2019s up about 12% year-over-year. Can you give us a sense as to where that\u2019s growing the strongest and where you are seeing a bit -- perhaps where you\u2019re seeing a bit more weakness within the core loan growth, specifically? Marianne Lake : I would say -- yes, of course. I'll do it in three parts. First of all, it's growing pretty solidly or strongly, so either in-line or in some -- in many cases better than industry across most of the product categories. The one that\u2019s growing the most strongly because of the way we\u2019re portfolioing loans is mortgage. So that\u2019s driving some of that outperformance and the one that is most challenging, but still growing is middle market. Fiercely competitive, competitive everybody is chasing that sector. But you can go through the businesses, so we had 6% loan growth, 6% to 8% loan and lease growth in Auto, 6% Business Banking, 19% core in consumer, 4% in commercial, so 3% core in card. So it\u2019s solid to strong, pretty much across the board, most competitive in middle market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages. Matt Burnell : Okay, Marianne. And for my follow-up I noticed I guess you were quoted in an earlier meeting today suggesting that there could be further provisions for the oil and gas portfolio. There has been some media reports prior to this week about regulators potentially looking a bit more carefully at your portfolio as well as a number of other banks. Can you give us a little more color as to how you\u2019re thinking about the potential trends there and any comment you might want to give in terms of where the regulators are focusing? Marianne Lake : So what I said earlier is not inconsistent, it\u2019s entirely consistent with what we said last quarter. We built results modestly from oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base. We built another modest reserve at this quarter, and we said we don\u2019t -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year, there\u2019s another redetermination cycle in the fall and its -- I\u2019m not going to say likely, but its possible we\u2019ll be selectively downgrading some time. If none of that is out of our expectations its completely sort of normal levels considering the cycle and how we think about the credit, we\u2019re still very happy. And we\u2019re not going to make any comments on regulators. Jamie Dimon : Those reserves do not mean we\u2019re going to have losses? Marianne Lake : Correct. So, we\u2019re reserving for downgrades, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re going to be catalysis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on that last point. Your commentary about credit, so the second half is in line, you\u2019re $4 billion plus and you had a $1 billion of charge offs this quarter again. So, on that point just one question about, where you continue to see underlying improvements, Card obviously is still above your guidance. But can you give us some of the thoughts about where any existing improvement can come from? Marianne Lake : So, I mean credit like charge offs have been very benign across the wholesale space. They\u2019ve reverted to somewhat more normal levels in auto. So I\u2019m not expecting that to be big step changes in the underlying charge offs in the wholesale space. We\u2019re continuing to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we\u2019re sort of getting down there. And Card well, its slightly above at the 2.6% above our 2.5%, its also pretty much getting there. So, its one of the reasons why we said, expecting second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and expect net-net low for long. Kenneth Usdin : And then to your point about not expecting to be much loss from the energy provisioning and that we could see energy provisioning, plus this quarter you had a nice $300 million release from the NCI portfolio. Is this kind of fit for reserve release, and can you talk about your outlook there? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say in the non-credit -- sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas, we said they will not necessarily translate into losses and we\u2019re not going to predict which ones will or won't. On the reserves, for non-credit impaired portfolio, we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as home prices albeit a little bit more gradually. So, I would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course of the next 18 months in hundreds of million of dollars in total, not billions any longer of course. We have $1.8 billion reserved right now. In the non-credit, in the purchase credit impaired space, clearly that life of loan model and so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have and expectations. So that will be what it is at the time. And in Card we\u2019re not expecting any significant reserve actions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe we can just ask a question on card fees. That\u2019s been an area where growth in card fees have been pretty flat for a while as you ramp up reward spending. We saw a pretty nice jump quarter-over-quarter at some of that seasonal but it was a little stronger than what we saw the last couple of years. Are we getting to a point where you\u2019re lapping some of these higher reward costs in growth and new accounts, we should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending or is this something unusual this quarter. Marianne Lake : So you\u2019re obviously right, all the underlying phenomena are still there, we\u2019re still seeing spread compression, but we\u2019re seeing very strong growth in spend. We aren\u2019t quite loud yet on new accounts going through the revenue rate. We will eventually be, but it\u2019s a good thing to be adding these new accounts that would drive new strong spend in the future. So, I would say, our near-term guidance is that we\u2019re expecting our revenue rate to be at the lower end of that 12%, 12.5% range. And yes over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships, we would expect that to start too agile. James Mitchell : Okay. And on the card loan side, it seemed like you saw a decent uptick this quarter. You\u2019re starting to get past some of the run off and seen more of a core driver? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I mean we told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space, low single digits. In this quarter it was 3%. Jamie Dimon : I just want to emphasis. Marianne mentioned it, but emphasis, Chase Paymentech which you\u2019re seeing really good growth probably 50% fast in the industry. But we\u2019re also signing people with Chase Paymentech combined with ChaseNet, we\u2019re running real volume across it, and we\u2019re signing up a lot of folks that act for ChasePay. So the strategy of ours is kind of coming to provision and we hope it will be a good driver, happy customers and good growth in the next 10 years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So, first question on capital. I just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about preferred issuance plans going forward, now that you have met the 150 basis point RWA target? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, obviously we don\u2019t give you lots of details on our issuance plans. You\u2019re right one of that, the drivers for us to issue in part not exclusively was its not -- as you know we were Tier 1 leverage constraint in CCAR, and so as a result of issuing this, we not only helped TLAP but we help our CCAR stress capacity and at we\u2019re about 164 RWA. So I mean, we\u2019re not going to talk about board issuance, but we made progress. Steven Chubak : Okay. And just a follow-up regarding Marianne your comments about the trading outlook for at least in the near-term. Recognizing its still very early days in the quarter, since the very start we\u2019ve seen -- well obviously we\u2019ve experienced a number of global shocks and on the regulatory front we do had that, that Volcker implementation deadline which is looming. So taking all those factors into consideration, how should we be thinking about the near-term trading outlook? Marianne Lake : So to start with Volcker, we aren\u2019t expecting Volcker to have an impact in the near-term trading outlook. We\u2019ve been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with Volcker. And so while that was real, reshaping of the business the last 18 months has been to really focus on getting operationally ready around the reporting and the metrics, and it\u2019s been hard work and we are ready. So I don\u2019t expect it to have a direct impact on near-term trading. Clearly over time we need to continue to sort of evolve the feedback lead with regulators, but that will be entirely gradual. With respect to the trading, its too early for us to say anything specific about the second quarter -- sorry the third quarter except to say, we are -- all other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the market levels. Nothing has changed that fundamentally wouldn\u2019t have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter. Jamie Dimon : I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time it\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve become very consistent. I think in 2014 we had no trading loss days and even this year going a hand full of trading loss days. And obviously some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. I think we\u2019re doing a great job servicing clients. We\u2019re adopting all the new roles, like 15% of interest rate swaps are on CES today and I think 95% of FX trading by transaction is electronic. You can do a lot of that on your mobile phone or iPad now. So, the business is actually doing fine. The returns on risk are very good. We need to report that, but kind of return on bar are very good. So it\u2019s become a much more stable business that clients need over time. Marianne Lake : And just to add to that, I would say that we also talked about in the sort of period of transition towards more normal economy and rising rates. You might see some shops like this. We weathered both the EMEA bond sell off and China well and it just speaks about the strength of our risk management discipline, and we generally do pretty well in more difficult markets. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Paul Miller : Yes. Thank you very much. You guys had a very decent mortgage banking quarter in the second quarter with rates going up. We know that that the refis have started to come down but the purchase market has been stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter. What do you see going into the third and fourth quarter especially with the new regulations come out with the disclosures with [indiscernible]? Marianne Lake : So with respect so we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market and we actually gained a little share in the purchase market in the quarter, and refi held up pretty well because of the pipeline is coming into the quarter, but we are expecting that to both seasonally in purchase and in refi to pull back down to normal levels in the third seasonally, and so no direct impact from the disclosure requirements. Jamie Dimon : And part of the quarter, we get reserve take downs, we don\u2019t double count that, that may not be there next quarter. Marianne Lake : Correct. Paul Miller : Okay. And then could you talk a little bit about the tax -- or my follow-up question on the tax rate. Should we be modeling in 20% to 30% going forward, is that 25% just an outlier? Marianne Lake : So, the way I think about it is our normal tax rate for the year is 30% or minus. Just given the way tax reserving is it\u2019s usually bias to being fairly conservative, and so as you know we have seen discreet tax gains periodically, some of them not insignificant resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax authorities. So, not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we don\u2019t predict or forecast the tax benefits. Paul Miller : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Matthew O\u2019Connor: The equity trading has been very strong the last couple of quarters, both for you and for others assuming it continues the rest of this earning season. And as you step back and think about some of the drivers there, you mentioned some repricing, we\u2019ve obviously seen some deepening of some markets, increased volatility. Like can we think about there being potentially a long-term secular recovery in the equities trading or do you think its more just stocks are going up as global QE or too early to tell? Marianne Lake : It\u2019s definitely the later, and I think it\u2019s perhaps a little too early to tell on the former. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, what type of mortgage loans are you adding. Are these jumbo? Are they fixed rate? Jamie Dimon : Jumbo. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, over half a jumbo, the other half are conventional conforming CCAR. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. And I guess are you choosing to add some mortgage loans instead of securities, because you\u2019ve got a smaller securities book than a lot of peers and it seems like there\u2019s capacity to add there. Marianne Lake : So well we have a fairly large securities portfolio, and our decisions around that are in part driven by our overall interest rate risk positioning. But with effect to the mortgages it\u2019s fundamentally a best execution decision for us. We will portfolio alone where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it other than jumbo where clearly they would always go on our balance sheet. Jamie Dimon : And if you could put a jumbo on a higher ROE than a Fannie/Freddie, you would do that. Marianne Lake : Yes. Jamie Dimon : And part of the invest proposed for liquidity and obviously because it\u2019s non-operating policy down portions of that will come down too. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the conversation in fixed income and I agree with you, it seems like you weathered the whole Greece and China is doing pretty well. The fill out on the lack of liquidity and the fixed income markets gets a lot of attention, you guys had the most market share, had the lowest standard deviation in the business as the liquidity provider, that\u2019s a good thing for you. But curious on how you\u2019re thinking about preparing for what seems to pretty serious issue, and how serious of an issue do you think it is that in terms of the potential disruption? Marianne Lake : So I mean, we have -- there\u2019s been a lot of press and reports including recently on market liquidity and there are numbers of factors playing into it. Its true that liquidities in some cases has dried up quite quickly when there\u2019s been extreme volatility and its been on itself but the reality is that, we talked about the fact that that was likely to be a phenomenon and that happened more frequently as we transitioned to a more normal environment, and we are very disciplined about how we trade into our clients and generally we\u2019ve been able to weather them very well. I\u2019ve had generally community we haven\u2019t, I mean not that we know, but we haven\u2019t got any stories or clear stories around the EMEA bonds settled for other things this quarter. So I think it\u2019s definitely an issue one that we need to watch, one that has multiple recourses, and one that we\u2019re generally taking in our stride. Jamie Dimon : And if I look at the big picture and we pointed out the financial system like in the United States banks are much more sound, trading books are more capital liquidity, the whole system is better off. So you can't look at one piece and say, what will that do? The second is that these -- obviously there\u2019s less liquidity in the market place and it\u2019s a whole bunch of factors. It\u2019s hard to tease out exactly which one. But trading books are more capital, more liquidity. I think people are little worried about potential Volcker Rule violations, they\u2019ve been a little more cautious. There are obviously structural changes in electronic trading HFT and each business is slightly different. So not every -- I would say everyone is expecting exactly the same. It\u2019s also true that system is pretty resilient to what happened with currencies, and that\u2019s a good sign. I think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets aren\u2019t that good. So, JPMorgan is fine. We are not talking about whether or not JPMorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity, we are not. The question I really would have is when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from this violent markets, will there be more volume or less volume. As someone was quoted other day saying their markets always pull back in when there are tough times, that is true. The question is, will it be harder and worse or will it feedback into the real economy. Its not will there be lack of liquidity. Like during the crisis, there were two market makers out there, and we were one of them, and so you need them a little bit. But it doesn\u2019t stop markets from gapping out. So, we\u2019re not saying, this is terrible but you just be very cautious about it, and we are always trying to be very cautious. Glenn Schorr : Speaking of cautious, the last one I have is on living wills. I know we have a little bit of time before we hear anything. But if you look at the comments from the previous year what they want is you all to address. It seems like there was a massive amount of progress made. I\u2019m not sure what you can tell us, but give us your thoughts on progress made and then maybe timing on when we might hear the regulators thoughts? Marianne Lake : Yes, I can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did exactly as you would expect entirely seriously put loads of resources and efforts to bear in making as much progress as we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period and we feel that we made very, very significant -- I would agree with you, the industry but JPMorgan specifically made very, very significant progress in addressing the feedback between getting it and the July submission date. And obviously we feel like we have a credible plan that\u2019s not to say, that we won't continue and some of our plans and you saw it in some others disclosures, we\u2019re going to continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entities structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and operational resiliency and all the things and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better. So, we think we made very, very significant progress. We think our plan is credible. We don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get feedback probably in the fall. Jamie Dimon : And we respond to every single thing regulators raise with the huge resources to meet their needs, and it will probably be iterative over time about whether it will make more demands this year et cetera and -- but I think this is 50 page public part that you can actually read and it shows you, that\u2019s 50 page summary of a -- I think a 200,000 page detailed report. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Marianne, you mentioned a couple of times about the competitiveness in the middle market lending space. Can you give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s underwriting standards and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive? Marianne Lake : I mean it\u2019s very broadly competitive and we compete obviously with state banks, regional banks and non-banks, and its not that we are loosing loans and deals and most often on price. It\u2019s normally on price of holds or non-banks taking whole deals or on structures. But its very, very competitive and everybody likes the sector for growth and everybody likes, so everybody is trying to make progress and we\u2019re being very, very disciplined and as a result of that slightly lower growth in the industry average. And you might not want us to always grow at the industry average; you want us to hold through to discipline. Jamie Dimon : And remember if you look at the whole relationship side, I forgot the exact number, but if you look at middle market relationships, I think somewhat like half maybe even a little bit less of the revenues are from the lending. Gerard Cassidy : You guys have made great progress with the penetration of the mobile banking app that you\u2019ve created as well as online banking and you can -- you showed us that your branch count is down over a 100 branches on a year-over-year basis. What do you see for the branches as you go forward? Is that trend line likely to continue as you continue with the increased penetration from the mobile app? Marianne Lake : So the way I would characterize it is, we had a period of time following the Wampum merger where we were in new market and we didn\u2019t have the right distribution footprint where we were building. We said about a year and half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a matter of about 5600 and that now we\u2019re around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it made sense building new ones where it made sense consolidating together where it made sense. So you would see, I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and that\u2019s probably still the right way to look at it, but its really perfecting that it worth moving branches to the areas we like, whether the high density of affluence. And then as you know really looking at the nature of branches as a footprint the way we\u2019re using them, the way we\u2019re staffing them importantly moving them to more advise and less transaction, more automation. So, definitely responses to the evolution in customer preferences and mobile and online is not only a fantastic customer experience evidenced in our experience that, but it\u2019s also a lower cost to serve. So we\u2019re also improving the profitability of the very highly transactional customers. So, I mean I think Gordon used the word omni-channel. It\u2019s, we have a place for everything in our fleet and branches are very important. And we\u2019re just going to be evolving them to continue to meet customer needs. Jamie Dimon : And one add is that we are thinking about attacking a new city for the first time, like in a major way because we want to see how that works out. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : Hi, I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits, and I would have expected that to come mainly out of the Corporate and Investment Bank and -- but when you look at the disclosures on your average asset level it\u2019s essentially been $850 billion plus/minus each over the last five quarters. So, where is the shrink really happening or how do we see it? Marianne Lake : In the non operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the CIB, but not quite two thirds and then you\u2019ve got the Commercial Bank and you\u2019ve got a little bit in Asset Management. So it is the majority of the number, but there often sizable numbers particularly in the Commercial Bank, in the financial [indiscernible]. And then when you look at our overall balance sheet you see cash going down because of the deposits. You see securities going down but strong loan growth offsetting and then small reductions in trading and secured financing. Chris Kotowski : But then I look at like total assets in the CIB, its $845 billion this quarter versus $846 billion last year. It just doesn\u2019t look like a whole bunch came out of there. It looks like it all came out of the \u2026 Marianne Lake : Are you doing year-over-year? Jamie Dimon : You\u2019re starting the wrong time period. Marianne Lake : Are you starting at the year end or year-over-year? Chris Kotowski : Well if you go length quarter its 865 to 845, it just -- I\u2019m just curious it doesn\u2019t seem to mesh up to ... Jamie Dimon : Well, we\u2019re getting more operating deposits too. Marianne Lake : Yes. So we talked about the, the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in operating. So, trust me and I\u2019m not looking at what you\u2019re looking at, so I do trust you but trust me that 68% of it is CIB. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Now, where you see it in your public disclosures, its -- it all looks like its coming out of corporate and other which is down more than a 100 length quarter. So, I was just kind of curious how it all works because it didn\u2019t \u2026 Jamie Dimon : We\u2019ll clarify it off this line because we [indiscernible]. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. My questions have been addressed. Thank you. Marianne Lake : Thank you, Eric. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Just following up on the markets discussion, curious whether or not you\u2019ve seen some of the drama around Greece impact the M&A discussions in Europe this quarter and maybe an update on the IB Bank backlog at this point? Jamie Dimon : The M&A we don\u2019t Greece has expected the M&A dialogue very much, because it\u2019s been very active pretty much around the world. And mostly around the world it\u2019s also like European companies coming to America, American companies going to Europe et cetera and those conversations continue \u2026 Marianne Lake : I\u2019d say a lot to Europe. Jamie Dimon : A lot to Europe. So Greece had no real effect in that. Greece is a very, very small percent of the Eurozone in total. So economically if not a driving factor for most of the companies they are. Psychologically maybe it\u2019s going to affect some people, but I don\u2019t see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece. Marianne Lake : And I\u2019ll just -- with affect to the backlog I would say, it\u2019s very good. Jamie Dimon : We did see a tremendous amount of some of that, we\u2019ve almost never seen before of the EU American companies financing in euro, because it\u2019s cheaper to do that even if you swap back to dollars. So a lot of American companies go to Europe to do that. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then on security services I know that you all highlighted that it\u2019s up quarter-over-quarter on the seasonal strength for the dividend season, but it was down year-over-year. Can you help us reconcile the year-over-year decline? Marianne Lake : Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter Brennan and take a look at the remarks in last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business, that drove a reduction but just a classification issue and then in addition we did loose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact. So, I think if you go back and look at the second quarter hopefully that will make it clear. And so the guidance when we did those, when we made that presentational change and obviously we talked about the client exit a few quarters ago the guidance well as given those we would expect the revenues to run between 950 seasonally and this is obviously a strong season and therefore its that through 950 to a billion seasonally and therefore its at the billion. Jamie Dimon : Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines which you don\u2019t normally do on treasury services, investor services and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. And Sarah finds it very frustrating that she can't get it corrected quarter after quarter. So we said here is the number that is actually our best guess. So please put in your third and fourth quarter models, and revenue mortgage revenue is another one which has been ongoing for us and what\u2019s the other one so we can just get on the table whatever it is. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Jamie, you made a comment about attacking new markets and that sort of tags on to what I was going to ask which is, whether there are any of the old WaMu markets where you\u2019ve not been able to expand as aggressively as you\u2019ve wanted to and you might be thinking about exiting. So, I\u2019m just wondering, can you just tell us how you feel about individual markets right now? Jamie Dimon : So Nancy, it\u2019s really important. When we talk about these numbers by the way, RWA and branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. That\u2019s our best guess, knowing what we know it, but we reserved the right to change that on a moments notice whatever reason it makes sense for the company and the clients. And so branches, it is very important that you look at branches, city by city and do you have the right footprint. So if you remember the old AMP which never changed its locations and it never changed its sizes and it failed. So every, any retail business should always be adding in the new communities, subtracting in some, having the branches adjust the new reality was getting bigger against smaller in our cases, getting smaller. But we\u2019re not getting smaller, because we\u2019re guessing at this stuff. We are getting smaller because the less need for operations in branches now and people are doing far more on mobile phones like that. So we actually do it city by city. We don\u2019t set an overall guidelines that you have to do X, Y or Z, it\u2019s city by city. And so for the most part in the WaMu footprint I think Florida and California for the most part, city by city we went in and added what we thought we should have. WaMu, then we also added on top of that small business, private banking, some middle market, other business that WaMu wasn\u2019t even in, and those are -- was part of the expansion of those businesses too and so, when I said a new city, I\u2019m talking about what we\u2019ve never really done -- I was talking about the way back to BankOne and the stocks we did the merger with JPMorgan is going into a city De Novo, that we\u2019ve never been in. And there you\u2019ve got to look at how many branch you\u2019re going to open, how long its going to take and, so we do want to do one of those and that will be -- will have nothing to do with WaMu, because there are places that WaMu wasn\u2019t. Nancy Bush : Okay. Another geographic question, I get that Greece is not that important to the Eurozone and events of the past couple of weeks seemed to have been a lot of theater frankly. But the events in China in the last couple of weeks have been somewhat worrisome. So, I mean, have your plans for China changed at all given what seems to be a retreat from open markets there? Jamie Dimon : No. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a retreat from open markets there either. So remember, we\u2019ve always said about China, you\u2019ve got to look and plan for long run which we do in all businesses. So McKenzie has reports that shows that they\u2019re going to have 25% of some of the Fortune 1000 and that was 10 or 12 years, enormous growth in their company. Their company is growing overseas. Their company is doing more M&A. We did that one unique transaction where ChemChina bought Pirelli in Italy. And obviously when we have a unique network we can help the Chinese company and the Italian company at the same time. So we\u2019re building there for the long run. As a risk management tool we\u2019ve always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times. And I think it\u2019s a mistake not to grow because you\u2019re going to have tough times. I have never seen an economy didn\u2019t have tough times. So, if you went back to United States when JPMorgan was building JPMorgan back to 1850-1860, look every single time that you panic because America had a recession, there would be no JPMorgan. So we\u2019re not going to change. What we\u2019ve seen with the officials in China is that they\u2019re very responsive to changes and you could argue whether they should have got in that involved in the stock market and you can\u2019t manipulate stock markets and, but they\u2019re very responsive to lending to -- they have changed their reserve policies, their RMB policies, the QFII policies, the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect. Not everything they do is going to work, but they still seemed very committed to more and more market reform, more and more of taking SOE rationalization -- SOEs and taking them public, so some market discipline there, creating more of a consumer society and what we\u2019ve always said and I think they\u2019ve the wherewithal to meet their kind of short-term objectives of growth. But we expect that they will have bumps in the road. We expect that and we\u2019re going to look right through that and the fact that their -- and also the market went from $4 trillion value, so its $10 trillion economy. It went from $4 trillion market value to $10 trillion, now its back to $6 trillion. I think those are the numbers. And the American stock markets has done that roundtrip a couple of times itself. And so the American economy is $18 trillion. I think our stock market is 25. And so there will still be huge opportunities there. If they ever completely reverse what they\u2019re talking about doing, you will see it in far more significant ways than getting involved in this stock market. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Oh, hi. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Marianne, earlier on you were talking about deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons, expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around. But could you round out the conversation as to how you\u2019re thinking about how your NIM is going to traject in a rising rate scenario? Because I got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys. Jamie Dimon : So Marianne, you showed a NIM thing that NIM will go back to 265 to 275. And remember when we say deposit beta, it is byproduct, by -- and it\u2019s got gamma. So the first 25 basis points, the second are a different 25 basis -- different in the third 25 basis points and it\u2019s a pretty intensive analysis trying to get it accurate. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and it\u2019s all in that number that we present it and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed dramatically. As Marianne said, we\u2019re assuming that whatever happen in the last cycle, this one will be worse. In other words, you will gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past. Betsy Graseck : Okay, because the last time rates rose your NIM didn\u2019t move up that much. Jamie Dimon : Well, listen there is a unique. Marianne Lake : Yes, its. Jamie Dimon : There is a unique circumstance when you\u2019re at zero. I mean there are lot of things that happen when rates go to 25 basis points that there will be -- you will pass very little of that on and we also see that -- we will see that money market funds. We will see that in some forms of deposits etcetera. The Beta gets high; it gets much higher as rates go up. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say we\u2019re conservative not aggressive. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Steven Duong : Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Just two follow-ups. You had mentioned the credit downgrades; I believe you\u2019ve said oil and gas. Where there any other sectors and if there were just some figures on them? Marianne Lake : Yes, the credit downgrades included oil and gas and we called it out just because in total oil and gas was $140 million of our total net 250 reserve build, but also I said that there was select names, it\u2019s like a dozen names. So not really like there is another sector, just its very discrete names. Steven Duong : Okay, great. Thank you. And just a second follow-up, can you just give us your mortgage duration and how far you\u2019re willing to take it? Jamie Dimon : No, no we are not going to give you that. We disclosed -- when you say mortgage ratio, obviously we build into all of our models mortgage duration and you guys can calculate that yourself by looking into disclosures in 10-K that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4% etcetera. And obviously we can change that at will with our investment portfolio and things like that. It\u2019s all in the NIM already. So obviously we have negative convexity in our portfolio. Operator : And there are no further questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you everyone. Jamie Dimon : Wait. Before you all go, I just want to tell you one of these days I\u2019m not going to come in this call. I\u2019m not doing it because I want to avoid it, I don\u2019t like it. And obviously if anything is important or really bad, I\u2019m not going to ever try to avoid bad news here, because we like to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, the good, bad, and ugly. But Marianne has started to do such a good job that I\u2019ve become unnecessary to be in all of them and I can obviously go do other things. So don\u2019t be surprised if one of these days I don\u2019t show up, don\u2019t read anything into it. Thank you for being here. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.8 billion, EPS of $1.68, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, on $23-1/2 billion of revenue. If you exclude tax adjustments, legal expense and net reserve releases, our adjusted performance was $1.32 a share with a 12% return on tangible common equity. And we've only adjusted for these three items because other small items that might be considered non-core netted to zero. Underlying results were somewhat mixed on the back of market conditions. The consumer business had strong performance with loan growth across products driving overall firm-wide core loan of 15%. In the corporate and investment bank, we saw outperformance in investment banking revenue and solid trading performance. Commercial banking revenue was down driven by lover IB revenues in a declining market. And asset management revenues reflected lower market levels, driving weaker client sentiment and transactional revenues. There were two significant items this quarter. First, tax benefits of $2.2 billion, the size of which speaks to the complexity of tax methods during the financial crisis. We took appropriately prudent position in our tax reserves and now we've reached resolution on those matters. The majority of this is in Corporate, with a portion in the CIB. The second item is firm-wide legal expense of $1 billion after tax relating to a range of matters, but including the recently announced CDS settlement. Also reflected in our results is a net reserve release of $281 million pretax, which reflects a little less than $600 million of consumer reserve releases as favorable credit trends continue, offset by a build of a little over $300 million in wholesale, approximately $160 million of which is additional reserves associated with the oil and gas sector, given expectations that energy prices will remain lower for longer. Getting over Page 2 and turning on to Page 3 and our balance sheet. We continue to make progress against our capital targets and, as expected, advanced and standardized fully phased in CET1 ratios in line with each other at 11.4% this quarter. Also we continue to expect the standardized ratio will be our floor from here. And the improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation. We also built Tier 1 in total capital, adding 1.2 billion of preferred stock and 1-1/2 billion of subordinated debt this quarter. We returned $2.7 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. Firm and bank SLR were at 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively, with the increase driven almost equally by capital generation and a reduction in average assets. While we're on the balance sheet, you can see on the call-out on the page that on a spot basis our balance sheet is down $160 billion year to date and an incremental $32 billion this quarter, as we reduced non-operating deposits by over $150 billion, exceeding our commitment. Total deposits are only down $90 billion, reflecting growth in more stable balances, particularly consumer. Finally, with respect to GCIB, we estimate that today we are squarely in the 4% bucket given actions taken and final U.S. rules, as compared to 4-1/2% at the beginning of the year. Now let's turn to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $10.9 billion was down 4% year on year, driven by mortgage on lower net servicing revenue. We remain on track to deliver expense reductions versus our $2 billion commitment, and year-to-date expenses were down around $600 million reported and over $700 million adjusted for legal expense. Our headcount is down 10,000 year-to-date and more than 40,000 since 2012. Underlying business drivers are strong, and based on the 2015 FDIC deposit survey which just came out, we grew our deposits nearly two times the industry growth rate. Average loans are up 8% with core loans up 23%. Our customer base continued to expand. We added 900,000 households during the year and our active mobile base is up 21%. Moving to Page 5, consumer and business banking. CBB generated strong results, with net income of $954 million and an ROE of 32%. NII was down 1% quarter on quarter and 7% year on year, driven by spread compression, offset by continued growth in deposits. And non-interest revenue is growing solidly, up 5% quarter on quarter seasonally and 5% year on year, on continued strong debit and investment revenue. Overall expenses were down 3% year on year on lower headcount from branch efficiency. We continue to see robust performance across key drivers. Average deposits were up 9%. And we grew deposits in all of our top 50 MSAs and gained share in nine of our top ten. Client assets were up 3% but down 4% quarter on quarter, broadly in line with the market. And net new money was positive $3 billion for the quarter. Business banking loan growth remained strong, with average loan balances up 6% year on year and originations up 4% from a strong 2014. Next, mortgage banking on Page 6. Overall net income was $602 million for the quarter. Originations of $30 billion were up 41% from the prior year and up slightly quarter on quarter as we benefited from a strong pipeline and continued improvement in the purchase market. We continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter. Total revenue decreased sequentially, primarily driven by lower net servicing revenue on lower MSR risk management. We expect non-interest revenue to be down around $250 million year over year in the fourth quarter. Expenses of $1.1 billion were down 13% year on year despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs. On credit, we released $575 million of reserve, including $200 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio and $375 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio, reflecting an improvement in both actual and expected delinquencies and the sustained improvement in home prices. Finally, our net charge-offs were $41 million and approximately $60 million normalized. And this is a reasonable estimate for the near term. Moving on to Page 7, card, commerce, solutions and auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion with an ROE of 22%. And revenue of $4.8 billion was up 2% year on year, on higher operating lease income in auto, as well as card revenue up slightly, reflecting higher NII on volume, spread and lower interest reversals, offset by the impact of changes to some of our co-brand partnerships. On our partners, we were thrilled to announce the renewal of two of our key partners, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. We look forward to continued investment and growth in these important relationships. And while we repriced to the current competitive market, our ROE target for the card business in total remains unchanged. However, expect the revenue rate for the fourth quarter to be 11.75% plus or minus. Expense was $2.2 billion, up 8% year on year driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing spend. On drivers, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in volumes and transactions across our businesses. In card, core loan growth was 3%, sales growth was 6%. Commerce solutions volumes were up 11%, driven by continued strong spend from existing clients but also from the addition of new merchants. Lastly, in auto, results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 9% and the pipeline is good. Finally, on credit, the net charge-off rate for the quarter was 241 basis points, and we expect net charge-offs of around 250 basis points over the medium term. Turning to Page 8 and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.2 billion, and an ROE of 13% adjusted for legal, taxes and reserve. In banking, it was a strong quarter with IB revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% year on year. We continue to rank number one in global IBCs and rank number one in North America and EMEA> It was another outstanding quarter for advisory, up 22%. We grew wallet share by 150 basis points year over year, maintaining our number two ranking. Equity underwriting fees were down 35%, generally in line with the market but from a particularly strong prior year. This quarter we ranked number one both in North America and EMEA. Debt underwriting was up 17%, driven by higher non-investment grade fees. We maintained our number one ranking, gaining 30 basis points of share. However, expect (these CM fees) be down year over year given the current pipeline. Treasury services revenue were flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spread, with underlying transaction volumes remaining stable. Moving on to markets. Revenue of $4.3 billion was down 6% adjusted for business simplification, with mixed results in fixed income but another strong performance in equities. Fixed income revenue was $2.9 billion, down 11% adjusted. In macro products we saw a strong performance in currencies and emerging markets, driven by higher activity on the back of market volatility in Asia and Brazil. Rate was down slightly given a particularly strong September of last year. And commodities was down on low levels of client activity, again, compared to a strong prior year. It was a low quarter in credit with lower volumes as clients were on the sidelines given the challenging market conditions. Equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year, driven by reasonably broad strength across products and regions, with good performance in cash, but particular strength in Asia and derivatives. Security services revenue was $915 million, versus guidance of $950 million, given depressed market levels which impacted both revenues and assets under custody, with emerging markets, which is one of our more profitable segments, being hit particularly hard. If markets remain at these levels, fourth quarter revenues will also be lower than previous guidance. On credit we saw a reserve build of $232 million, including $128 million for oil and gas. Finally, on to expenses, total expense was up 2% year on year at $6.1 billion. Compensation expense was down 13%, with [inaudible] revenue ratio of 30% in the quarter, and non-compensation expense was up 14%, driven by higher legal expense, partially offset as we realized the expense benefits of business simplification. Moving on to commercial banking on Page 9. Commercial banking generated net income of $518 million on revenue of $1.6 billion and an ROE of 14%. Revenue was down 5% quarter on quarter, driven by lower investment banking revenue, as we saw fewer large transactions in the quarter. However, the pipeline for the fourth quarter is solid and we still expect record gross IB revenues this year, exceeding $2 billion. Expenses of $719 million were in line with guidance. Loan balances were a record at $162 billion, up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter, driven by continued outperformance in commercial real estate where quarter-on-quarter growth of 4% exceeded the industry across both multifamily and real estate banking. C&I loans were flat, in line with the industry. Mature markets were relatively flat, but we saw growth in our expansion markets, up 4% quarter on quarter. Credit performance of the portfolio remained strong, with no net charge-offs, and an $84 million increase in reserves included a modest build for oil and gas. Overall, while results were mixed this quarter, the underlying fundamentals of the commercial bank remained strong. Pipelines are trending higher in C&I and remain robust in commercial real estate, our expansion market loan balances are up 20% year on year, calling activity is up substantially across client segments, and we've added around 400 new middle market relationships this year. Moving on to Page 10 and asset management. Net income of $475 million with a 28% pretax margin and 20% ROE. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 5% year on year, driven by lower markets, which also drove lower transactional revenue, as well as the sale of retirement planning services in 2014 which drove $70 million of the year-over-year decline. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect revenues to show normal seasonality from this low base, assuming current market levels. Expenses were relatively flat. And AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $3.3 trillion held up well and were relatively flat year on year, with negative markets and outflows driving a 4% sequential decline. We were not immune to the impact of interest rate uncertainty in equity markets, and while we did experience overall modest net outflows, we had positive flows in our less market-sensitive multi-asset class and alternative platform. In banking we had record loan balances of $109 billion, up 7% year on year, driven by mortgage which was up 19%. And lastly, we continued to report strong investment performance with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Turning to Page 11 and corporate. Treasury and CIO's [ph] result for the quarter were both close to home. The corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion, driven by tax benefits. And finally, firm-wide NIM was up 7 basis points quarter on quarter given the mix shift away from cat and securities towards higher loan balances and on an overall smaller balance sheet. Loans are the primary driver of nearly $250 million improvement in NII, and given market implied NIM and NII should be relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Finally, our loan-to-deposit ratio improved 8 percentage points year to date to 64%. Turning to Page 12 and moving on to the fourth quarter outlook. A few items to call out. First, you'll see we updated our adjusted expense target to $56-1/2 billion plus or minus for the full year, which is better than our previous guidance and would equate to the fourth quarter adjusted expense being relatively flat to the third. We're expecting core loan growth of 15% plus or minus to continue in the fourth quarter. And finally, on markets revenue. Starting with business simplification which will drive a 2% decline year on year, in addition, we expect to see normal season of the clients in the fourth quarter versus the third. And looking back over the last three years, that client has been on average about 15%. And so far in October, across asset classes, the markets are pretty quiet. Obviously we're only two weeks into the quarter and it's too early to give a specific guidance, but based on those facts alone, analyst estimates appear high. Wrapping up, overall the Company performed quite well against the backdrop of interest rate uncertainty and volatile markets. We continue to invest in our businesses and the underlying drivers are growing strongly and we're gaining share. And we have more than successfully delivered against each of our capital, balance sheet and expense targets. And just before I finish, on one of those investments we're making, I want to update you on the progress we're making on our payment strategy. We continue to capitalize on our leadership position in payments. We have unparalleled assets in our issuing scale, we have the largest wholly-owned merchant acquirer, our own closed-loop network in ChaseNet, and now a digital wallet in ChasePay, which will be launched more broadly this year. The beauty of this is that we're able to bundle all of these capabilities together to provide better pricing and experiences for merchants, including access to data as well as a better and more relevant experience for customers. We expect to process more than $50 billion of Chase card volumes over ChaseNet in 2016, and Gordon will share more details at Money 2020. With that, operator, please open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks very much. So I'm curious, the capital markets related commentary, I guess there could be hangover effect into fourth quarter, and I'm guessing that's the primary driver behind your analyst estimates appear high on fourth quarter. But could we talk about what you're actually seeing in terms of where the financial markets are maybe drawing the line, meaning, are the deals that underwriting you expect to fall off in the fourth quarter based on your pipeline, is that a function of timing that you think could come back next year, are these marginal deals where markets are drawing the line? I'm trying to get at the ultimate question of, is this the first time that SIC [ph] could actually grow in 2016 just because of the beat-down it took in the back half of this year? Marianne Lake : So there are a couple of different questions in there and maybe I'll try and separate them. My comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards markets revenues and less so towards the IB revenue space. With IB revenues, it's a mixed story, so, talking now about the sort of banking revenues rather than the markets revenues. So the pipeline for M&A remains very constructive and really pretty good. So we're expecting to continue to have strength in M&A in the fourth quarter. With ECM you saw obviously a pretty sharp falloff in activity in the third quarter. We have seen the pipeline in ECM, to the degree that that shows you visibility in the fourth quarter, which is somewhat limited, we have seen that build up. And so there is possibility that we'll be able to pull through some of that into the fourth quarter. But that will depend upon how the markets behave. With respect to DCM, our sort of guidance there was that, you know, commentary really to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, and on relative basis, the pipeline is down. And it's really to do with the normal refinances are slowing and the maturity wall is smaller. But it's still healthy, just not going to be at the same levels that we saw last year. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Maybe just to follow up. In SIC [ph] in general, I know none of us have a crystal ball, but the slowdown in activity that we see, some of the clients sitting on hand, maybe you could separate that between any providing of liquidity and marks along the way, because we did see a real wide credit spread widening in the quarter. Marianne Lake : Yeah. I mean, look, the situation for us in markets was one where, you know, where there was volatility, regardless of how you want to characterize it, and people were acting - our clients were acting on the back of that, we were able to capitalize on that flow, we were able to intermediate for our clients, but our capital (risk makes) money, and so we did pretty well where there was volatility. And where there wasn't, it was more about, to your point, more about low levels of activity, people on the sidelines. So it was just tougher to make money because less was happening, rather than anything else more significant than that. But so far in the fourth quarter, I mean we're two weeks in it, too early to say, but there's not been a tremendous change in the landscape. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks. Marianne, can you talk a little bit more about the card business and try to help us understand, the card revenue pressure that we saw this quarter into the fourth, how much of that is the NII side of things and how much of that is kind of the partner repricing, and how far past the fourth quarter do those resets continue before growth can overcome it? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I would -- so, looking at the revenue rate guidance, so, remember our guidance previously had been you should expect our revenue rate to be at the low end of the 12%, 12-1/2% range. The most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term. And the economics of those deals on a standalone basis are still really very good, but the cobrand space is very competitive, and when any of those contracts are going to be renegotiated at this point, they're going to be renegotiated to competitive levels. And so it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter, which is going to push it down to below 12%. And it doesn't change the fact that the ROE target for the business is still 20% and that the economics of those partnerships is still good. And remember these -- UCR: Just giving the numbers. It's $200 million a quarter for four quarters until last. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Got it. Okay. And my second question, just on, you know, in this tough revenue environment, first of all, can you just give us a quick update on the progress on the expense plans, and then, you know, any - does anything change given how tough this revenue environment has changed as far as either accelerating or digging in again? I know your prior comments have focused on obviously always needing to invest, but in terms of just your focus as you think about next year and building the expense budget against the environment that we're seeing. Marianne Lake : Yes. So I would say, first of all, we gave some expense goals in Investor Day to both consumer businesses as well as for the CIB. And those were I think pretty sizable goals, $2 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the consumer businesses and $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the CIB. And we are working through that, we are on track in both of them. I think I said earlier that, adjusted, the consumer businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year over year in expenses. So, against the $2 billion target, we're certainly getting there. And on CIB, we expected 2015 to be mainly about forcing out those business simplification expenses, and we've essentially done that too. So we're on track, we're pushing hard. We still have work to do. We are always going to be diligent on our expenses, and generally speaking, at Investor Day we also said we're going to on or down, which is actually pushing hard to keep them down, but not at the expense of good investments in the business. So, obviously we are going to respond appropriately to the revenue pressure but not overreact. Jamie Dimon : I've spoken my whole life about good expenses and bad expenses. You know, bad expenses are wastes, things you don't need, you don't [inaudible] through processing, things like that. But we want certain expenses to go up. When we find marketing opportunities in card, we're going to spend. If the investment bank does better, the comp accrual [ph] is going to go up. So that's how we run the Company. It's not ever going to change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi. Just to follow up to that last question. So, of the total $4.8 billion of expense savings, how much have you achieved? And if you're on track, why did the adjusted overhead ratio go backwards at 60% in the third quarter versus 58% in the second and 59% last year? Marianne Lake : So, Mike, thanks for that. So, $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the consumer businesses, year to date we'll do some more in the fourth quarter. And year to date on business simplification, which I think in total was about $1.5 billion, we've done $1.3 billion. So in total, that $2 billion so far, obviously more work to do in 2016. With respect to the adjusted overhead ratio, it speaks a bit more to seasonality of revenues than anything else. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right. And one follow-up. Clearly it's due to revenue. So the question, Jamie, if you could answer this, a simple yes or no question, is the economy getting stronger or weaker? And the reason I asked that, the jobs report from a couple of weeks ago seems to imply the economy is getting softer, yet your loan growth actually -- your core loan growth accelerated and you're guiding for a faster loan growth in the fourth quarter. So, is there noise in that loan growth figure or is the economy, based on what you're seeing, getting stronger and the jobs number is misleading? Jamie Dimon : It's not a yes or no on. Marianne Lake : I'll start and then you can yes or no at the end. So, Mike, we would say that the U.S. economy is doing pretty well there. We're seeing good demand for loans in the consumer space and reasonably good sentiment in the business banking space, and our core loan growth numbers do show that. So there's nothing particularly funky in the loan growth numbers. We do our very best to show them in the right light. I would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report, the non-firm [ph] payrolls, and not to sort of overthink it, but while I know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it still at around 140,000 was almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment. So, you know, it's only one report too, you can't overreact to it. So it's not that we're seeing anything that's causing us any concern and our outlook for the fourth quarter is pretty solid I think. Jamie, anything? Jamie Dimon : Nothing to add. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, Marianne. You saw some very good improvement in the GCIB surcharge from the 4-1/2 to 4, probably came a little faster than some of us expected. Do you have good momentum there to do more there? And how are you thinking about the trade-off, the cost benefit trade-off of pushing further down on that GCIB bucket? Marianne Lake : Yes. So we did better than we had targeted for -- on our non-op deposits. We went -- we worked very, very hard, but we told you we would, on derivative, notionals, compressionals or Level 3 assets. It is absolutely the case, not to diminish the amount of what we've done and the progress we've made, that we obviously went after the most impactful, you know, least impactful to the clients, most impactful to the ratio, with the less revenue give-up first [ph]. And so we made great progress. It becomes increasingly, not exponentially, but increasingly more difficult for every next basis point. So that's not to say, by the way, that we aren't continuing to work very hard at it and optimize and that we won't push further, but we're not at a place right now where we're going to target anything structurally below this, except for over the longer term just continuing to work through it. And our overall capital target, we're at 11.4% now, our overall capital target still in the short to medium term is still 12%. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : I just want to add, in the new world, we have to obviously monitor and push down to all the business levels, GCIB, CCAR [ph], Basel, LCR and SLR, and we want to optimize all of them. So we're only doing this for a couple of years now, as we embed it in our systems, it was a better way to track and monitor it. Over time I would expect the GCIB will come down a little bit. So, you know, it only comes down in lumps, you've got to make a big difference to go from 43-1/2, but when I say over time, I'm talking about years. I'm not talking about anything that's this quarter. We're very comfortable where we are today, but over years, yeah, you might change your business strategy, but I think it's a better thing not to be an outlier in GCIB. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Thanks. So, just a question on the capital getting to 4% now with a goal over time to get to something lower, 3-1/2, 3. Does it also give you more room for capital return request next year, Jamie? Jamie Dimon : It has nothing to do with next year, Betsy. When I say over time, just it's happened that JPMorgan built a global corporate investment bank, 70% of it is financial institution and 30% corporate. We easily could have been built the other way around, it's who you focus on over time. So when I say over time, it might be quite easy for us to say over five to six years, let's focus more on the corporates and less in financials, and that will affect your GCIB fairly substantially. So that's what I'm talking about. It's nothing to do with CCAR [ph] for next year or anything like that. Marianne Lake : A couple of really small points on CCAR [ph] for next year for what it's worth, is we were constrained in CCAR [ph] by leverage. We have issued $6 billion of preferreds in the year. We are reacting to try and make sure that we are managing our binding constraints or our most binding constraints. So we're working on that. The other thing to note is that we're at 11.4% as we sit here now, so we're not gliding a long way from where we need to get to. And both of those things, together with obviously our profitability, should mean that we have incremental opportunity. But our range is 55% to 75%, and we hope to be in that range. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just TLAC [ph], I know we're still waiting for the Fed decision, but we did get FSA [ph] recently, anything in there that you can respond to us to how you're prepared for TLAC [ph]? Marianne Lake : So, just a couple of things. First of all, I think the FSB [ph] thing was a sort of leak, so it's as good as it is. I will tell you that the news on structured notes was not strongly positive, but we hadn't banked on it being. So, not entirely pleasing but not disappointing relative to our sort of models and expectations. Other things to pay attention to anyway are there's no change to the internal TLAC [ph] assumptions. The holding -- the clean holding company rule is one that we're watching out for. But fundamentally -- and then there was the timing. Is there going to be a substantially elongated transition period? I would call it all sort of fairly marginal, so it hasn't changed the overall picture for us. We're at around 16% and we'll figure out the FSB [ph] that's leaked out, wasn't shockingly different, and we'll see how the Fed respond. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Good afternoon. Just maybe a question on NII and NIM. I think, Marianne, you said it would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, yet you're still expecting some pretty strong loan growth. Just want, you know, if you can maybe discuss why you think it would remain flat in that scenario? And maybe a bit longer term, in an environment where we're looking at lower for longer potentially in the rates, how do we think about the NIM a little bit over the intermediate term? Marianne Lake : Okay. So with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow, and overall net-net sort of rotation of our cash and securities to loans would be supportive of NII. But remember, the biggest boost to our NIM was associated -- or one of the big boosts to our NIM was associated with changing the mix, reducing our overall cash balances, and so where [inaudible] going on. The outlook for the fourth quarter being relatively flat was associated with market-implied rates which are relatively flat. And so in the law of big numbers, that plus or minus a few basis points is what we're expecting. With respect to looking out to 2016, obviously we don't know what's going to happen with the curve. If rates stay very flat, we should still have upward pressure on our NII associated with the change in mix of our balance sheet. So the fact that we've got a smaller interest-earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supported, even on flat rates. We don't know when rates will rise, but if market-implieds are followed or if the Fed does or anything like real estate, then that will be even more constructive. And remember, in the first year we got the biggest benefit from shortened [ph] rates in the first 50 basis points of them. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Right. I was hoping you would know when rates go up, but thanks. Marianne Lake : No. Unfortunately not. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Yes, good afternoon. My question is on the credit outlook. The consumer reserve release has continued to offset the wholesale reserve build. And I'm just wondering, how should we think about how much is left on the consumer side over the next several quarters, especially given the 23% loan growth that we saw this quarter and your note saying that this momentum should continue? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I would say that, first of all, with respect to purchase credit impaired, with this release we did on the 375, that's our baseline expectation for that portfolio. So our baseline expectation is no material incremental reserve. Obviously if things improve and they're sustained, then there may be more reserve releases. But I wouldn't try and model those. With respect to the non-credit impaired portfolio we talked about, you've seen our charge-offs at normalized 14 basis points. Our portfolio quality is really getting quite high. We're fighting through most of the significant risks. So, reserve releases will be more modest and a little bit more periodic. And several hundred million dollars next year, maybe 300 plus or minus, but not significantly more than that. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : And just my follow-up question, following on Ken and Mike's question on expenses, maybe I'll ask it another way. Over the past few quarters your adjusted overhead ratio was 58% to 60%. You noted that you think that net interest income could grow next year even if rates stay low. Could you potentially slide below the 58% to 60% band that you reported over the past two quarters relative to, you know, you mentioned efficiency target of 55% if rates actually normalize? Marianne Lake : Yeah. I mean, look, our efficiency target at 55% was over three years or so, and we still will be driving to get to around that level, but it does, as you quite rightly mentioned, includes not just rates rising but a fair degree of normalization in rates. So we'll see what happens in 2016. Obviously it's possible. But we're not going to call an outlook on rates next year. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. First of all, Marianne, if I could, in terms of some of the credit numbers that you mentioned in terms of the oil and gas provisions. They seem pretty modest in the scheme of your more than $20 billion of exposure to that industry. How are you thinking about the redetermination process that started this quarter? And how would you guide us in terms of thinking about what the provisions could be in the fourth quarter following the redetermination this quarter? Marianne Lake : Okay. So we've taken some modest reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices. There was a redetermination cycle that we reserved for in the first quarter, and so there will be another one in the fall. We've been as forward-leaning on that as we can be. Obviously I'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build, but we're not expecting them to be significant. A lot of companies have tried to adjust their expense basis and otherwise help their position. So if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting net not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter. We may see some. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then in terms of mortgage banking, you noted that production -- the production amount was actually up quite nicely year over year, but the revenues in terms of production and also in servicing were a bit weaker, certainly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but the expenses were relatively stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there something going on there that we might see further improvement in the expense space in the mortgage side of the business in the fourth quarter or are we sort of -- are you at where you think you need to be in terms of the $1 billion to $1.1 billion a quarter in that business? Marianne Lake : So just let me deal first of all with production quarter over quarter revenues. Margins are down -- margins are down for two principal reasons. So, remember, quarter over quarter, at least on a closed loan volume, we were at a consistent level. Margins are down because we moved -- our mixed shift towards correspondent from retail towards purchase from refi, as well as capacity in the industry, you know, more capacity in the industry, and therefore less constraints. So the production quarter-over-quarter revenue is more of a margin number than anything. With respect to year over year, I do want to make this clear, with respect to the guidance year over year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage company in totality, to be down $250 million, that brings our total year-over-year NII [ph] down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at Investor Day. And it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on Ginnie Mae sales and [inaudible] against [ph] the, you know, sort of non-fee-based revenues that are to do with third-party UPB, as well as runoff in the UPB. So it's consistent with our guidance. It wasn't fully reflected in everyone's models. I think there was a third part to your question, but I have -- oh, expenses, yes. Thank you. And on expenses, in the -- there are two -- so we continue to work very hard in our expense equation, both in terms of managing down the -- particularly in the servicing space by the way, managing down the default inventory in a number of different ways, but also investing in our operating model, so, in technology, to improve the production, operations, cycle, process, also in our site strategy. So, no, we are not done. We continue to work very hard at it. We have made great progress, but we continue to work hard at it. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Hi. We've seen some assets change hands, and you guys have been mentioned as a buyer for some of the other assets that are out there. Just wondering on what the ability and appetite is out there to buy loans. Marianne Lake : So, look, obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. We would be willing to take and we do take a look at things when they come up. And if we are able to price for the risk and it's in a client segment or an entity [ph] we like, we might be interested. But there's no -- we have no special comments on it. What we're really interested in is growing our underlying core loans with our customers that we can continue to do business with. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : And then just separately, following up on energy, how exactly do you kind of reevaluate the portfolio? Is it as a default cap and that's where there's a big boost to reserves, or you get in front of that? Marianne Lake : So, not if default [ph] happen. I mean it's to do -- it depends on whether it's reserve-based lending or whether it's not. But as companies are either downgraded or as they are experiencing change in financial condition or the borrowing base is redetermined, we will act accordingly. We try to be as forward-leaning on that as is possible, but it's not, you know, we don't have perfect insight until some of that information becomes clear. So that's the process. Jamie Dimon : And the reserve-based lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you have to really engineer your cores [ph] and things like that, and you see if you can make -- roll over the loan at a sound, call it 65% LTV, and we think it's pretty good. That's what we're here for, to lend to clients, particularly in tough times. You can't be a bank that every time something goes wrong you run away from your client. And then we also do things like stress test that down to $30 oil, maintain $30 like 18 months and say, which -- how much more reserves [inaudible] put up? And I think somewhere, and you correct this number, Marianne, we're not in the same room, that if that happens, we think we're going to have to put it in $500 million or $750 million in reserves, which is just not something we worry a lot about. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Hi, good evening. Marianne Lake : Good evening. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Marianne, I appreciate your commentary on the preferred issuance that you guys have done so far throughout the year. It looks like you're now above the 150-basis-point target. You alluded to that being a function of efforts to manage to your binding constraint on the CCAR [ph]. I just wondered if you guys have a sense as to what -- how you guys are thinking about issuance plans going forward. Marianne Lake : Yeah. So it's obviously a really great question. Unfortunately, we really don't guide to our sort of forward-looking issuance. You're right, we are above 150 basis points right now. And we're also working on our leverage balance sheet. So we're working at the sort of dials exactly as you would expect us to, but we are not going to make any comments about forward issuance. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Understood. Had to give it a shot. Marianne Lake : Yup, I got it. Steven Chubak - Nomura: So, just moving to the investment banking side, and maybe trying to just dig a little bit deeper into some of the guidance you've given on M&A. It looks like the backlogs and expected completions for the fourth quarter are quite healthy, at the same time, post the August volatility, some of the historically strong M&A indicators like market cap, CEO confidence, those measures appeared to be deteriorating. I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the M&A outlook beyond the fourth quarter, just given some of the weakness that we've seen in some of those measures. Marianne Lake : Yes. So the pipeline for 2016 is building up, so we don't have perfect visibility yet. We think, obviously, the deals that were being done in 2015 were skewed towards larger deals and we think there may be flown in 2016, but it looks pretty healthy for us so far, but it's building up. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Marianne, can you share with us, you mentioned that you've built out 400 new relationships in the middle market area of the commercial bank. But when we look at the loans outstanding, they're essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, whereas the corporate client business has grown very rapidly. Can you give us some more color behind what's driving those numbers? Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean, I think over the last several quarters, and forgive me if I'm slightly wrong, but I don't think I'm entirely wrong, our sort of C&I growth has been broadly in line with the industry. Remember that over the course of 2013 and 2014, we did a lot of work on simplifying our businesses, and that had an impact on the pace of our loan growth. But our mature markets are performing well. We're seeing growth in our expansion market. We're adding new clients. We're calling our prospects. So, everything is set to continue to see growth more going forward than we have in the past. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. And then you talked about the reserve build in the CIB about $128 million was for oil and gas and the total number was $232 million. What was the other areas that required reserve building this quarter? Marianne Lake : There was about, in CIB, there was about $47 million of metals and mining, about net-net $20 million of BAU growth, and then just a few other normal BAU puts and takes, downgrades, upgrades. Other than those three things, there was no one specific fall-out. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Mine were asked and answered. Thank you. Marianne Lake : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : Yes. On your mortgage banking side, I've noticed that your jumbo loans -- or not your jumbo loans, that your residential loans in your balance sheet's grown. Are they mostly jumbos, are they coming out of your normal production, that $29 billion, and you're selling less to the government? Can you add some color around those numbers? Marianne Lake : So, of the $19 billion that -- of the $19 billion that we put on our balance sheet, around 10, just a little over 10, was jumbo. The rest was conventional conforming. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets : And then, are they mainly ARM loans or are they fixed-rate loans? Marianne Lake : We'll have to [inaudible]. Jamie Dimon : I think the jumbo is like a third ARM. I've got to confirm that these are all fixed. That's what I remember. Marianne Lake : We'll confirm for you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities : Thanks very much. Marianne, if I can just follow up on some of the consumer credit quality metrics. At the Investor Day and subsequently Gordon was indicating, unsurprisingly just given the very low levels that the expectation should probably be for some moderate rate of deterioration, and yet we haven't seen it. And I'm guessing that's partly because of the underwriting that's occurred over the past few years. So my question is, what are the circumstances in which we should expect more significant deterioration there? Is it only macro or is there something else competitively that could influence that at this stage? Marianne Lake : So you are right that, at this kind of 2-1/2%, one of these base point levels in card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers, which is much more now about driving, yes, some NII, but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality. It's sort of an integrated equation. We're expecting, given our originations and the runoff portfolio are the worst loans running off in the portfolio that we're building is really very, very clean. We're expecting that those charge-off rates to be low for the short to medium term, the readout for the next year for sure. There will be a combination of things that would drive that. It would -- but largely it would be environmental. We don't expect at this point we have made changes to our credit books, but they aren't material changes, and we'll continue to test our appetite to want to do that, and that may have an impact. But we're originating the vast majority of our cards in the super-prime sector. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities : And is -- are the dynamics similar in auto as well? Marianne Lake : Similar, yes. I mean we're, compared to the industry, our originations are skewed to the prime space. And our LTVs are lower. And the -- our durations are in line or lower. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Yes, hi. Just a quick one at this point. Equities, Marianne, you highlighted strength in Asia, which I think probably was better than maybe some had expected given some of the volatility. So, could you give us some color on the trends you saw in that region in your equities business? Marianne Lake : Well, I would -- the biggest comment I would make is that there was a lot of volatility, particularly in China in the second part of or the last part of the second quarter. We were -- we did pretty well, we helped our clients, we didn't have significant open risk position, we weren't very directional, so we were able to do well in that situation. Also in the reverse, also on currency moves. So really -- it really is the comment I made about we're here to serve our clients. They were transacting. We were able to do risk intermediation [interj] for them. And so we kind of made money on both ends. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Thanks for that. Operator : You have another question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Marianne Lake : Hi. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Hi, Marianne. Quick question on your consumer business. You guys have shown very strong steady growth in the mobile users. I think it's over 22 million in this quarter, that's up from 18 million a year ago. Can you share with us what percentage of your customers are actually mobile users, and how does that compare to a year ago? And where do you -- what does Gordon think, what's the penetration rate that you think you can finally get to there? Marianne Lake : So let me just talk qualitatively for a second and we'll get you some numbers. But we're focused on mobile and digital primarily because it's going to be great for the customer experience. It's what our customers want. And also because it's a significant enabler for reducing cost to serve and improving efficiency. So we've been very focused on whether it's quick deposit, whether it's quick pay, whether it's our mobile wallet, whether it's our mobile app, and we've been seeing great results. I'm, off the top of my head, not able to tell you the penetration rate, but we can get back to you. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. And is there any evidence that you guys can point to where you're actually taking market share from other banks because your mobile products are just more superior than some of the smaller regional banks and community banks? Marianne Lake : I can tell you that we are growing our deposits nearly twice the industry, that -- so I think that's a reasonable indication for a bunch of different reasons, and that we have a very highly rated app -- I think the most highly-rated bank app, but we'll check that too. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Okay. And then finally, your asset yields jumped this quarter, which was good to see of course. Can you share with us how the Fed funds rate went up as much as it did sequentially? And also your securities yield went up in the quarter sequentially. Can you give us some color behind both those numbers? Thank you. Marianne Lake : So on the Fed funds and reverse repos, we had moved towards higher-yielding, for example, emerging market assets. So we got some higher yield there. We saw some yield on our trading book moving out of assets of emerging markets. So, just a bit of puts and takes. And on securities, was it significant? I'm sorry, I'll come back to you. Operator, any more? Operator : There are no further questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you everyone.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our Web site. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $5.4 billion, EPS of $1.32, and a return on tangible common equity of 11%, on $23.7 billion of revenue. Included in the result is legal expense of $400 million after tax for a range of matters and we continue to put some issues behind us. This is reflected in a reduction of more than $1 billion to our reasonably possible loss estimate this quarter. In addition, we recognized the benefit of a settlement reached of $300 million after tax which related to moneys owed to Washington Mutual in connection with a failed savings and loan institution. We've shown these on the page as legal related and the benefits recorded in revenue in Corporate. Much like we saw in the third quarter, the overall company's performance benefited from diversification across our businesses. We saw strong growth in consumer drivers, on the back of improvement in the U.S. economy in large part generating core loan growth of 16% for the company. Global markets remained challenged across a number of fronts leading to lower client activity and lower inventory. Against this backdrop the CIB delivered solid performance across products. And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets. Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3, the firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion. Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion driven by non-core items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity. Adjusted, our underlying businesses were up modestly. We're very happy with our expense story for the year. We delivered adjusted expense of $56 billion, down $2.4 billion and a 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted overhead ratio. And while we did have a modest benefit from the strengthening dollar this year, we also self-funded incremental investments. Credit performance was strong, in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at $4.1 billion. With obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against, which we built about $550 million in reserves this year including $124 million this quarter. And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant. We also built $68 million of reserves in metals and mining including $35 million this quarter. We're watching the sector closely and similarly if commodity prices remain at current levels, we would expect some additional reserve build but would not expect them to be significant. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $11 billion including dividends of $1.72 a share. Turning to Page 4. Starting on the top left, overall our average balance sheet is down $100 billion year-on-year and our spot balance sheet down over $200 billion with of course the biggest driver being the reduction of approximately $200 billion of wholesale non-operating deposits ultimately reflected in lower cash balances. In addition, you can see notable reductions in all other balance sheet categories except for loans which reflects the 16% core loan growth we achieved. Some portion of the other wholesale balance reductions were purposeful and will be sticky, particularly the decrease in short-term wholesale funding balances. The remainder resulted from volatile markets and general deleveraging driving risk of and lower inventory across products. As client demand for leverage grows we will likely put some of that balance sheet back to work. Moving to the right. The story on deposits continues to be a very positive one as we delivered some incremental reductions in non-operating balances, while consistently growing retail and operating deposits. On the bottom left, overall, NII was up about $300 million driving a 7 basis point improvement in NIM. The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant. Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count. However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII. Perhaps the highlight of this page on the bottom right is that based upon the actions we've taken throughout the course of 2015, we believe that we have just reached the 3.5% Method 2 G-SIB bucket and that we are in or close to the 2% Method 1 G-SIB bucket. So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. Turning to Page 5. We're ending the year well ahead of our capital targets with the firm's advanced fully phased in CET1 ratio at 11.6% and our standardized fully phased in ratio at 11.7%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction in risk weighted assets. With net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances. And these deliver a more meaningful reduction under the standardized approach. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future. Firm and bank SLR were at 6.5% and 6.6% respectively. Finally, we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter including $1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 a share. Let's turn to Page 6 and consumer and community banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter. And full year expense was down by nearly $1 billion or half of our commitment if you adjust for legal and $150 million of incremental investments this year. Going forward, we will look for opportunities to further reinvest. You can see headcount was down by 12,000 for the year and nearly 43,000 since 2012. The fundamental business drivers remain strong. Year-over-year, average loans were up 11% with core loans up 25% driven by mortgage but with strength across products. Average deposits were up 10%. We added nearly 600,000 households and our active mobile customer base continues to grow, up 20% to roughly 23 million customers, the largest of the major U.S. banks. Moving to Page 7. Consumer and Business Banking. CBB generated strong results for the quarter with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32% on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion. Although NII was flat quarter-on-quarter, it was down 5% year-on-year on spread compression, largely offset by that 10% deposit growth. And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume. We expect NII to show normal seasonal declines in the first quarter. Expenses was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency and additionally client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balances up 6%. Next Mortgage Banking on Page 8. Overall net income was $266 million, originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year. Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth as well as on higher MSR risk management. For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion brought in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue. As servicing balances continue to decline and as we expect production margins will compress in the smaller market. We expect the decline in 2016 to be around $700 million. Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter related to exiting the OCC's consent order but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continued to manage costs. Finally on credit, net charge-offs of 13 basis points reflects the quality of our portfolio. Moving on to Page 9. Card, commercial solutions and auto. Overall net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 24%. Revenue was $5 billion, up 10% year-on-year driven principally by two non-recurring items. The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of square. Adjusted the revenue rate was 11.9%. And in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues while driving growth in NII. Year-over-year, we saw growth of 12% in auto, loan and lease balances, 6% in card sales volumes, 3% in cards core loans as well as 12% and 14% in merchant processing volumes and transactions respectively. Expense of $2.2 billion flat quarter-on-quarter but up 4% year-on-year reflected higher depreciation on auto lease growth. And we expect expense to be relatively flat into the first quarter as we continue to invest. While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December and we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year-over-year with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth. Finally, on credit, in auto net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, they were still below our long-term expectations and in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016. Now turning to Page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenue of $7.1 billion and ROE of 10%. In Investment Banking for the full year, we continue to rank number one in global ID fees and number one in North America and EMEA. In M&A, we maintained our number two ranking and grew wallet share by 50 basis points. In ECM, we ranked number one globally, up from number 3 last year and in DCM we ranked number one across high yield, high grade and loans. Banking revenue for the quarter of $1.5 billion was down 11% driven by lower debt underwriting fees. It was another outstanding performance in advisory fees, up 43% in the third quarter in a market that was down 12, largely driven by North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 4% in a market down 12 with the U.S. remaining somewhat slow but a resurgence of large transactions in Europe and Asia. And debt underwriting fees were down 43% from a record last year where we saw an unprecedented number of large fee events. Treasury services revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter but down 4% year-on-year on lower deposit spreads. In markets, a number of factors contributed to a quiet fourth quarter overall across products. Investor risk appetite was significantly dampened by a series of market events and clients retrenched and derisked early. With that backdrop, the markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends. With adjusted revenues down 16% sequentially and 1% year-on-year. In Fixed Income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions offset by year-on-year declines in currencies in emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being persisted as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those same things plus a number of single name corporate events. Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year. With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity we were light risk going into the year-end and inventory was low and so far our trading businesses are performing well. But as you know it is early and difficult to predict how the quarter will play out. Security services revenue was $933 million in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset based fees. For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million which includes seasonality. On credit, we saw a reserve build of $76 million which included $63 million related to oil and gas. Finally, expense of $4.4 billion was down 20% year-on-year mainly driven by lower legal. The comp to revenue ratio was 26% for the quarter and 30% for the full year. Moving on to Page 11 and the Commercial Bank. The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%. Revenue was up sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year. However, for the full year, it was a record for Investment Banking with gross revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from 2014. Expense of $750 million included $50 million of impairment on leased corporate aircraft. On the reassessment of residual values, the remaining balance sheet value of this portfolio is modest. We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in this business and gain share. In C&I loans were up 11% largely driven by corporate client banking of on the back of several large transactions. Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs. However, we did add $100 million to reserves, $60 million of which relates to oil and gas and $26 million for metals and mining. Moving on to Page 12. Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $500 million with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year driven by lower performance fees in alternatives. Expense of $2.2 billion was also down 5% year-on-year, roughly equally explained by lower performance fee driven compensation as well as a benefit from refining the value of the held for sale asset. Assets under management of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.4 trillion were down 1% and 2% year-over-year respectively. We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion with solid inflows in equities being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates. However, we had strong long-term investment performance with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years which should be supportive of future flows. And for the full year, we had positive long-term inflows of $16 billion. In lending, we had record balances of $110 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by both mortgage as well as traditional loans. Turning to Page 13 and Corporate. Treasury and CIO reported net income of $138 million for the quarter. Included in this result is a pretax benefit of $178 million relating to certain securities held at a discount that were called at par. And this was in our NII. Other Corporate net income of $84 million included a net benefit of $60 million after tax for the legal related matters we discussed earlier as well as a contribution to our foundation this quarter of $150 million pretax. Turning to Page 14. I've given you some guidance throughout the presentation and this page is for your reference. Obviously, when we get to Investor Day, we will give you a comprehensive outlook for each of our businesses for the year. So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%. We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points. Delivered strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge and capital levels. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Marianne. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : So curious about whether or not you all have seen the stress we've seen in some of the credit and equity markets and some of the volatility impacting M&A velocity appetite amongst Boards and C-suites broadly in your conversations and throughout the IB? Marianne Lake : So I mean, again, I would say that the pipeline coming into 2016 in M&A was good, solid, up, in fact. Obviously, volatility can dampen the confidence of Boards and CEOs. Dialogs are pretty active and we think the types of deals that we'll see in 2016 will look different. But I think in the first couple of weeks it's not being particularly strong and we do need to see some of the stability come back I think for us to really see that conversion start to pick up. Brennan Hawken : And just by different, is that a reference to the size or can you be a bit more specific on what you mean? Marianne Lake : Yes. Less mega deals, more mid-sized deals, more cross border, it's a little different. Actually more deal count, less big mega deals could be very constructive for revenue but we're likely to see it be a little bit different in 2016. But honestly the pipeline is good. And, yes. Brennan Hawken : That's helpful. Marianne Lake : North America will be a tough comp. It was very strong in 2015, but Europe could be very constructive. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Helpful. And then you referenced energy prices staying this low would lead to a significant reserve build, you expect in your energy book. Can you maybe give a little bit more color around that? How would you define significant and how long would oil need to stay down here in order to see some of that reserve action? Marianne Lake : Yes. So the way we do our reserves, just for context because I think it's important is obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss given default [for certain] [ph] customers. But I think it's also the case just for context to know that it is very name by name specific, specific conditions at clients matter greatly and so when we do these estimates they are directionally correct and order of magnitude correct, but that's just for context. Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, here we are and stayed there for call it 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed. So it is not the current market expectation that oil will flat line. It is the expectation right now that there will be a modest recovery. Based upon that we would expect to take some additional reserves but for them to be more modest, less significant. But that's kind of the range if oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. I wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question. It just seems as though $124 million in additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still in the 30s and so my question's for Jamie. As you look back, how does the oil and gas situation today compare to prior periods of stress? We have 2002. We had the TMT meltdown when you were at Bank One you reduced the lines of credit. You got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren't exactly at the start but then you adjusted and you said hey, this is a big issue. Now we have oil and gas, which could be another industry specific stress and you're only taking additional provisions of $124 million. Is that going to be enough and one year from now are you going to look back and say whoops we didn't get ahead of this enough. Jamie Dimon : I think we try to be very conservative always and so we're not trying to put up as little as possible. You know me, I'd put up more if I could but accounting rules dictate what you can do. And these are baskets -- the real risk is in producing wells, cash flows are down, surprisingly the cost of getting the oil out of the ground has also dropped dramatically and probably much more than most of us would have expected. So you take these producing wells, you take the cash flow, you discount, you discounted it 8% or 9%, you lend against it. And so these are our forecasts. Our energy book isn't that large relative to JPMorgan Chase. We're not worried about the big oil companies. These are mostly the smaller ones that you're talking about these reserve increases on. Marianne Lake : I also think Mike just a -- Jamie Dimon : And the forward curve is -- at the end of the year for 2016 is like 41 or 42 or something like that. Marianne Lake : Forty eight. So hey, Mike, the other thing to know about the sort of profile of reserves, three things. The first is, it's not linear. So just the oil price decline and the decline in the forward curve that we saw towards into December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves. It's fallen significantly in the first two quarters. That was not a knowable condition and we can't reserve for that at the end of the year. That's why we said we would expect to take some more reserve increases in the next couple of quarters. But again, it's a name specific thing and lots of other conditions at clients' matter including their hedging, their cash flows, the level of security, all those things. Mike Mayo : And how do you use CDS to help protect yourself on that portfolio? Jamie Dimon : We don't. Mike Mayo : Okay, you don't. And then, the last follow-up. Do you intend to keep lending to the oil and gas companies as they run into problems? On the one hand, you have the risk of throwing good money after bad. On the other hand, if you stop lending as much and you have the high-yield market retreating and you have private equity firms retreating, maybe it becomes a liquidity crisis for some of the oil companies. Which is it, do you lend more or less to the oil and gas sector? Jamie Dimon : The oil folks have been surprisingly resilient. Remember, these are asset backed loans. A bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean your loan is bad; have to be a little bit careful. There is also, Mike a philosophical thing, a bank is supposed to be there for clients in good times and bad times. So it's not a trading market where you try to support clients. So then we can responsibly support clients, we are going to. And we lose a little bit more money because of it so be it. We've done that around the world. We did it in 2007, 2008 and 2009. We tried to do responsibly. If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stuart Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us where you are on your expense reduction targets in the consumer and the investment bank and how does that translate to some thoughts about the expected trajectory of total firm-wide expenses for this year? Marianne Lake : So let me just deal with where are against our targets. So the most notable targets were $2 billion in the consumer businesses in 2017 versus 2014 and $2.8 billion in the CIB in 2017 versus 2014. You probably heard my comment, but to clarify on an apples-to-apples basis we're halfway through on consumer. We have done $1 billion this year. You don't see that 100% translate into the results partly because of legal expense which is not something that we particularly can predict and hopefully won't see that forever. Also because we intentionally decisioned in 2015 in the fourth quarter in particular, mostly, to increase our investments in the consumer businesses by $150 million. So we've achieved the $1 billion. We chose to reinvest a portion of it. Another $1 billion we're on track for. We will potentially reinvest some of that too and Gordon and we will talk to you about the basis for that at Investor Day. On the $2.8 billion in the CIB, we're $1.3 billion through at the end of the year and we talked before about the fact that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business simplification. We've had the revenue decline. We need to have expense decline and we worked hard to deliver that and we have. The next chunk is to do with technology and operations and infrastructure and organization and it's harder. And so we will continue with them on track to deliver it, but it's going to be a job through 2016 and into 2017. John McDonald : And how does that all net into an outlook for this year if you're willing to give us some thoughts on that. Marianne Lake : Yes, I can give you some thoughts that won\u2019t totally satisfy you which is our core expenses will continue to trend down on the back of delivering against them. We will make investment decisions that we think are good for the company, accretive for shareholders, that will respend some of that money. And so we'll give you that shrink and grow at Investor Day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through, obviously your commentary that NII will be even flattish in the first quarter adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes that a nice helper from that first move. And you guys are really conservative on your deposit beta thoughts when you talked about them previously. I know probably haven't seen much change yet but you how are you expecting the deposit behavior to act and there has been any change to your modeling expectations about what might come through as we get through the first couple of hikes. Marianne Lake : So just on NII, yes, we are seeing embedded in that sort of NII flat to slightly. We are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet, but we were flatted in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO. So that's going to mean the comparison is changing and day count is obviously seasonal. So that's being dynamic. We are seeing the rate benefit. We do expect to see it as I said in my remarks for the full year. Look, we think we are appropriately conservative on deposit meters. It is not -- it is way too early to have any idea. Virtually nothing has moved yet. And so our job and what we are doing is paying very close attention to the competitive landscape. These deposits that we're talking about that have the high basis are valuable deposits with valuable clients for us and we want to be competitive and pay fair rates. But it's so early in the movie that we haven't changed much in our modeling assumptions. Ken Usdin : Okay. And my second question, if I can ask an ex-energy credit question. A lot of concerns we're going to get into some type of broader deterioration of which your numbers showed no signs of heading towards --what are you looking for? Are you seeing any signals of ex-energy changes in either delinquencies or watch trends and are you still comfortable with kind of that low 4s type of charge-off expectation that you guys had talked about previously? Thanks. Marianne Lake : So energy, metals and mining, we're watching very closely industries that could have knock on effects like industrials and transportation but we're not seeing anything broadly in our portfolio right now. We're just watching very closely, which is why -- now, obviously, you can take our reserve build number and you can say it's almost essentially all made up of oil and gas and metals and mining and behind the scenes we've had upgrades and down grades of a number of other different companies across sectors but nothing particularly thematic yet but we're watching. Jamie Dimon : Now, you point out that credit card, Commercial Bank, middle market, large Corporate credit is as good as it's ever been. Obviously, it's going to get a little bit worse. I wouldn't call it a cycle per se. If you have a recession you will see a normal cyclical increase in all those losses. We're not forecasting a recession. We think the U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point. Operator : Your next question -- Marianne Lake : So based on that with the obvious caveat of what happens with oil prices and energy over the course of the near future, yes, we would still expect our charge-offs to be relatively low. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. So I think you talked about some of this Marianne in terms of the method 2 of surcharge now estimated at 3.5. I'm just curious, I think if the numbers are right, you took down notionals and there is about $4.321 trillion in level three assets, $50 billion in non-op deposits. You've said that you don't want to be an outlier, so you're whittling that down. I'm curious of the driving force behind it, what kind of revenue give-up there is in such a move like this because we like it and thoughts on the go forward. Marianne Lake : Yes. So look, we talked about achieving 4% last quarter I think and for disclosure we were quite close to 3.5. At that point it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin for what you could do to get within the bucket and so that is what we did in the fourth quarter is spend time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary which we thought at that point its was. And remember, if not nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits and while there still could be some volatility in that number of course, we've almost doubled that or doubled that in fact. So we got some wind to our backs in doing it. It's also the case that when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that at the margin in our 100 different things little benefits accrue. So we're at about 3.5, we're just inside the 3.5% bucket as best we estimate it. It's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above it, it's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket. And that's going to still take work. So that's why he we'll obviously talk to you more about this at Investor Day. In terms of the give up from an economic perspective we wouldn't have done it at any cost. We have done it because we think it is important to do because we think it's going to be constructive for the company and because the revenue give-ups were not significant but they weren't zero either. But to be able to reduce a constraint that is in one way or another likely to bind us in multiple ways in fact likely to bind us. It was a -- I think very good trade. Jamie Dimon : It was done effectively, client by client. Marianne Lake : Yes. Jamie Dimon : Make sure we are trying to do the right things for our clients not just jamming our balance sheet down and hurting people. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. I just had one quick follow-up on Ken's last question. If two-third of the economy is consumer led. You look at all your early stage delinquencies like Ken said. And Jamie to your comments, things look okay. I hate putting words in your mouth but what do you think the disconnect then is between what's going on in the markets versus what's going on in the trends in your business, both in terms of growth and forward-looking credit books. Jamie Dimon : The U.S. economy has been chugging along at 2% to 2.5% growth for better part of five years now. In the last two years it has created 5 million jobs. And when you look -- if you look at the actual household formation, car sales, wage, people working, it still looks okay. Corporate credit is quite good. Small business formation, it's not back to where it was but it's quite good. Household formation is going up. So, obviously, market turmoil we all look at it every day but I'm not sure most of the 143 million Americans look at it that much who have jobs and you have a big change in the world out there. People are getting adjusted to China slowing down. When you have commodity prices go down like that there are big winners and losers. The oil companies are the losers. Consumers are the benefit. Brazil gets hurt. India benefits. South Korea benefits. Japan benefits. And those kind of terribly worse and hopefully this will all settle down. It's not the beginning of something really bad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi. The disclosure around the oil and gas is really helpful. And I was wondering, if you could just walk through something similar on metals and mining. So you gave us the -- I think you said $68 million of full year reserve build and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are. Can you give us the balance and then is there a comparable $500 million to $750 million stress test for oil and gas or stress case, is there a comparable, what is the stress case if broader commodities in metals and mining comes in worse. Marianne Lake : Okay. So our total reserves on balance sheet for metals and mining notwithstanding we built $60-odd million. This year it's over $200 million. So the coverage ratio is pretty good. The exposure is about -- I haven't got the precise numbers in front of me. They're a third the size of our exposure to oil and gas. So that 2% of our overall wholesale credit exposure. So considerably more modest, which is why if energy prices and general commodity weakness and stress stays where it is right now, even for an extended period we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest. Jamie Dimon : And it's also that one is mostly name by name. Marianne Lake : Yes, for sure. Jamie Dimon : It's not big asset based reserves. It's the big corporate credits name by name. Marianne Lake : And so both oil and gas and metals and mining in our portfolio, oil and gas is close to 60% investment grade and metals and mining about half. Brian Foran : And then on I guess staying with credit, on home equities and the whole issue of free cash from interest home-made amortizing. Can you kind of lay out how it's progressed relative to your expectations so far and also remind us how big the allocation of the reserve is against that and I guess not to lead the witness, but is that an area where things are trending early days better than expected and could provide some buffer against maybe anything else that happens on the C&I side? Marianne Lake : Yes. So with respect to home equity reclass, remember the majority of the problematic home equity underwriting for 2005 to 2008. So here we are at the beginning of 2016 with sort of [indiscernible]. But we're monitoring it closely and we have some reclass that have happened, obviously interest rates are low. Home price appreciation on the other hand [indiscernible] and there are puts and takes. We've been monitoring I would say at the margin or more than at the margin at early stages coming in better than we had modeled and remember from an incurred loss perspective we would consider these reclass risks to be largely incurred. So we tried to reserve them to the best of our ability, so we feel good about our reserve but I think we disclosed them. But so far from a performance perspective, I would say slightly better than our models but we continue to monitor it because it's still relatively early. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Marianne, I know that the Basel committee put our their fundamental review of the trading book proposal this morning, so clearly no one's had time to really go through it in detail. However, I'm sure you've already gone through the prior proposals and done the QISs for the last couple of years. The proposal is better than what had been -- the ruling is better than what the proposal most recently had been. Just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you can manage to this 2019 implementation timeframe. Are there things set in motion already or is this something that you would start from here? And if you could just give us some broad strokes on how you think about overall impact that would be helpful. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, obviously, you'll forgive me because we've been on call since it came out but yes we have been working on this for years. The problem with this particular rule is as you stated based upon the four QISs that were done there were some -- I would characterize significant challenges with respect to the rules as written and we were expecting there to be a number of meaningful changes and there have been. In many cases meaningful improvements. But it's very technical and there's been a lot of changes so we need to suture it to figure out net-net everything. Although it is clear that net-net despite factors the faith and intention of the committee wasn't necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher but by how much it's really going to need to be sifted through and for that same reason, for both those same reasons, I'm sorry, for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed many I guess that have not. It would have been premature to have taken any actions in advance of figuring out where this has landed and you as you know the period, so the comply is three years. So it's more of a start from here to figure out how to manage with this after we sifted through the details. So I wish I were able to give you a little bit more of a detailed answer but we're going to need to take the time to go through it. Betsy Graseck : Right. I totally understand that. And I guess my basic question is, you can take action as opposed to just deal with what the current decision would be for you. There are actions that you can take to reduce the impact. Marianne Lake : Well, there are always actions we can take to reduce the impact. And so we have to think about them in the context of our overall capital optimization program, and again, if there are -- if some of the things that we hope -- and honestly I've been on call since it came out. Some of the things we hoped were going to be addressed have not. They could have had or may have meaningful impact on the specific types of activity. And we will have to react accordingly. And yes, we will take actions if that's the right answer. I wish I could give you more details but we just need to go through it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Steve Chubak : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Steve Chubak : So I had a couple of questions on capital. The first relates to the RWA progress which did surprise positively in the year by about $50 billion ahead of expectations. And I was just hoping you can give a better sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50 billion reduction was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts, maybe even tied to the mitigation efforts that you guys had talked about which should presumably remain in the run rate versus balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk loss environment that we're experiencing today. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say that based upon our sort of fourth quarter balance sheet given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels were a driver particularly on standardized, we could give back on standardized as much as 10 to 20 bps of capital, of the 10.7% capital accretion. But the bigger points on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a neutral to upward pressure as we continue to grow these high quality loans. So even though the RWA is being at the 1.5-ish trillion dollars sooner than we expected is obviously good news regardless of how much that may in the short-term reverse. Our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient to try and keep it there just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. We can become more efficient in advance but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. So that's what we're focused on. I wouldn't take the 1.5 trillion in read through that we'll be continuing to decline from here on standardized. We'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love but that have [indiscernible] under a standardized basis. Steve Chubak : Understood, Marianne. That's very helpful. And then maybe just switching gears to the G-SIB surcharge. Clearly the progress surprise positively, getting down to 3.5%, I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets. I recognize you'll likely lay that out at Investor Day. Just want to get a better sense as to what methodology are you employing in terms of thinking about a management buffer and all the different binding constraints that you have to manage to day-to-day and thinking about through the cycle target that you guys would like to manage to. Marianne Lake : Okay. If I missed something at the end remind me. So in terms of how we think about buffers just really conceptually, the firm manages and the Board has set for the firm a risk appetite. That risk appetites has a number of features and capital depletion in a stress environment is one of them. And so when we think about setting buffers we think about it just broadly you in the contexts of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses within our risk appetite and not have to take premature actions from a capital perspective. So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. With respect to our target, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulatory capital because as you say we're bound potentially by multiple constraints and one of them may be CCAR. Plus -- well, it is CCAR I should say because as you know the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. And we haven't done CCAR but this is not any kind of prediction, but it wouldn't surprise you to know that it's unlikely we will pay out 100% of our earnings in CCAR going forward. So we are on a path to continue to accrete capital though we would like to move in our payout range. So given that we're still moving towards our 12% target and we will update you if any of that changes at Investor Day. We'll also as you know potentially going to understand whether or not the Fed changes any of the CCAR parameters and whether that has an impact. So at the moment the best we know is that we're going to continue to accrete capital albeit more slowly as we hope to move up in the payout range. But we haven't done CCAR yet. And that's if the rules don't change. So 12% is for now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. Marianne, if I could just clarify your NII comment from the very beginning of the call. Do I understand correctly that the $2 billion of incremental NII that you've cited is just a function of the repricing dynamic as they move through your balance sheet or is there also I guess a contribution from loan growth? Marianne Lake : So think about in a rate scenario when you can pick whether you believe the market, or whether you think the market is or whether you believe the [indiscernible]. And I think it's going to be data dependent. So we're not going to have a stated opinion on that. But because of the mix in our balance sheet in 2015 as well as our expectation of continued loan growth we would expect mix to contribute about half of that and the first 25 basis points about the next half because we are more sensitive to the front of rise and the first 25 basis points. And you can see that in our earnings and risk disclosures. So even if we see nothing else. Obviously, we believe and the market believes that you're going to see a couple more hikes. That would be on average another 25 basis points. That would be incremental NII again. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thank you. And so I know we just touched on RWAs but how do you suggest we think about GAAP assets for this year? Marianne Lake : I would say I would think about them in a somewhat similar directional way, given that our balance sheet ended below $2.4 trillion. A little bit of it market delivered a lot of it purposeful. But we do intend to continue to gather deposits and extend loans and portfolio loans as well. So while you will see some security balances decline and the like, I would say again net modest growth, about modest and very lending driven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to -- I had a follow-up question on fixed income trading. I think Dan Pinto has talked benefits from higher rates and so I guess number one, I wanted to see if you had had any thoughts on that, have you seen any initial benefits to spreads in the fixed trading market with the first rate hike. In contrast you've had a couple of competitors announce or at least reported that they're cutting headcount. That seems to be a little bit in contrast to the expectation that fixed income to pick up with higher rates. So if you could sort of talk through your thoughts on fixed income. I do notice that you did mention 1Q is off to performing well. So maybe that's part of it too. But if you could help on that, that would be great. Marianne Lake : So in terms of the impact of rates, obviously, there was a lot of monetary policy confusion broadly in the fourth quarter, the ECB underwound the Fed. There was a lot of confusion. By the time the rate hike happened it was obviously pretty well understood. We did see strong activity or strong client activity relatively speaking on the back of that in the rates business, more so than necessarily about spreads. With respect to the fixed income business, we've always been very disciplined about how we think about the staffing levels and expenses in that business. We've managed it very carefully. The compensation has come down across the trading businesses and it wouldn't surprise you that some of that -- a lot of that has been in fixed income. And business is upscale and productive. So -- Jim Mitchell : So you still feel pretty comfortable with your outlook that things could improve and market share gain potential as competitors pull back. Jamie Dimon : You've even in fixed income -- we have a very good fixed income operation globally around the world. Rates themselves don't filter through fixed trading directly. I think what Danny was talking about if you have a healthy economies and confident investors you have more volume in things like that. We do see a little bit of repricing taking place. Prime broker, repo, conduit some of those run through FERC. That is going to take place as the world adjusts to new -- all the new capital requirements. And obviously, a lot of seasonality in the business which you've experienced for the last decade. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My questions have been asked and answered. Marianne Lake : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. If we look at credit spreads in the bond market even ex-energy they've widened considerably and I'm wondering if this has resulted in wholesale credit being repriced at all. I realize the bond market doesn't set bank loan pricing but just wondering if you've been able to reprice some of the wholesale customers or expect being able to do so. Jamie Dimon : We've seen no real repricing in loans on the balance sheet. You have seen a little bit of it, people are getting other revenues to make up for their credit exposure. Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean think about the bank loans as being relationship loans that need to be sort of in the context of relationship and everybody is they -- Jamie Dimon : They bought them. They really repriced in 2008 and 2009. Banks were continue to lend up at existing price but these were long-term relationships. Bank loan not reprice like the markets do. Matt O'Connor: I guess I wonder why like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in considerably over the last several years. C&I pricing came in. I realize it might take some time. But I would think there's some opportunity for some repricing around the edges, no? Jamie Dimon : Well, we haven't seen it. Marianne Lake : Also, it's very, very competitive. Everybody has been chasing these loans. And so that's a factor too. So we haven't seen it yet. Jamie Dimon : The number at middle market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related. So clients, they also know what the relationship is to the bank. While we need to make a good return on capital, capital tied to a client is only partially loan related. That capital on its own doesn't earn an adequate return. Simple lending on its own generally not an adequate return business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Jamie to follow up on your comments about maybe some better pricing in prime brokerage and repo because of the capital requirements or requiring you guys to raise prices, can you expand upon that? Do you see it growing where you could get even better pricing going forward because of less competition. Can you give us more color there? Jamie Dimon : I think the better way to look at it is people seem in certain of our businesses and I mentioned those and there are some other ones, capital has been deployed, people have adjusted to the new rules and you've seen pricing go up. But it goes up a lot. I wouldn't count on it going up a lot more from there. The markets are going to be competitive at that point. The use of balance sheet, the cost has gone up. Not loans but most of the other stuff. Marianne Lake : And remember we think about our prime brokerage business going hand in glove with equity. Jamie Dimon : That's correct, Marianne. Marianne Lake : And so while the repricing is helpful and everybody is going to continue to always observe their pricing. We built our platform internationally, Europe we are seeing strong demand for our traffic product. In Asia we're adding clients. We've got the wind to our backs. So it's an important business to our clients. You're right there are some other people potentially not going to be as aggressive and if we can take share, we certainly will. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then the follow-up question is obviously the FASB is coming out this quarter with the new loan loss reserve methodology, the current expected credit loss versus what we're using today. Obviously the incurred loss model. There's going to be a true-up for everybody. Have you guys given any thought that when this goes into place when you may take that true-up, assuming say you have to implement it by 2019, or something like that, would you do it much before that or can you give us some thoughts on your thinking about what's going to happen. Marianne Lake : Well, obviously we expect any transition adjustment to go through equity. If we are able to adopt it early we might do that. I'm not aware that we are. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Paul Miller : Thank you very much. We know that you implemented a new disclosure form in the mortgage banking space trend. Did that have any -- you guys had very good mortgage banking results. Did that have any impact whatsoever on your operations in the mortgage bank? Marianne Lake : So, yes, obviously it was -- I think if you add up other servicing rules, print them out, put them on the floor and stand them next to me they're a foot taller. They are very complicated. There's a lot of operational complexity to complying. And we're working very hard at doing that. I would say in the quarter we did as part of being cautious about making sure that we're complying, our cycle times were a couple days, few days worsened. And so volumes, our origination volumes are a little lower than we would have otherwise seen that's a lot. And that's just timing and it's just days. But not really from a financial results perspective because of the way we recognize revenue. So I would call it a little bit of teaming products across the industry, by the way, not just us, nothing significant. We are going to get the work finished and so it talks. It is what it is. Paul Miller : And then a follow-up question on your portfolio. You look like you grew your residential loans by about $11 billion. Last quarter you said it was a mix between agency and jumbo. If it's a big chunk of it's agency can you give us your thoughts on portfolio of that agency product. Marianne Lake : Yes. so, it's about 60% jumbo, 40% agency or conventional performing and it's a better execution decision. So when we look at the better economics between selling or portfolioing the mortgage we'll generally choose the better economics but we also prefer the annuity nature of the NII, the lower servicing risk and the better capital efficiency. So it has been the case over the course of the last several quarters that it has been the best execution to portfolio of these mortgages and actually they are generating a nice return on equity. Operator : And you do have a follow-up question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : One quick follow-up, Marianne. You've had some pretty big tax gains the last couple quarters, running below 30% of your tax rate. At some point do you pull forward future benefits and run with a higher tax rate in the future. Marianne Lake : We have had pretty big tax gains over the course of the last -- most notably over the last quarter, of course, the last couple of years. Most of those related to the sort of call it 2003 through 2008 tax period when we were going through the financial crisis and so some of the matters were more complex and we took appropriate reserving decisions on that. There are many less of those very complicated matters ahead of us and so we wouldn't expect to see the same sort of size of tax benefit going forward as we've seen in the past. But we had some this quarter. So we'll have a few and generally speaking they are because of the nature of the reserving perhaps generally speaking we take a conservative approach and bias to the positive but it could be much more plus or minus zero at this point. John McDonald : So what's your natural tax rate if you don't have those. Is around 30 or is it closer to -- ? Marianne Lake : Thirty. John McDonald : Thanks. Operator : You have another follow-up question from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Marianne Lake : Hi, Brian. Brian Foran : I was wondering if I could just sneak in on credit cards. Do you think the competitive environment has hit a plateau and on co-brands are there any kind of large upcoming repricing events and is there any bigger than a bread box size you can give on, Marianne? Marianne Lake : So do I think it's plateaued? I think it remains incredible competitive generally, particularly in the co-brand space. So plateaued at a very competitive level I suppose. But in terms of -- I'm not going to talk about any specific names, actually, Brian in terms of the potential for repricing. It's an important part of our business and we're going to defend our business. Brian Foran : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Marianne Lake : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Marianne. If the regulators lift the dividend payout ratio in this year's CCAR to 40%, would you guys consider lifting your dividend payout ratio something closer to that? Marianne Lake : Well, it's a Board decision and so neither have we received that guidance from the regulators nor have we done CCAR and had that discussion yet with the Board. But we have generally said that the Board likes to have the flexibility to increase dividends over time and we have had our dividend most recently sort of at or close to that soft cap. So we would love that capacity and I would imagine that over time it may be used but again, it is a Board decision, not a management decision. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then just one last follow-up. On the G-SIB buffer, obviously you guys have done an incredible job in bringing it down to where it is today. When do you expect the regulators to put you into that bucket assuming you guys are obviously looking at the same types of numbers? Marianne Lake : So, from we do have -- so, first of all, I would say the following. Right now my understanding and if I'm wrong forgive me is that your spot balance sheet two years prior that would drive your two years forward. But the reality is, if you want my opinion given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going forward and because of the likelihood that G-SIB may or may not feature into CCAR. I think it's going to be less important necessarily what you're at any one moment in time, but where you are projecting to be or stay. I suspect that we will get the benefit potentially of this, not today. We disclosed our balance sheet. But I think it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward as it guess potentially introduced into stress test. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Marianne Lake : But I don't know that. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Marianne Lake : Thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35, and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue; and despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward. Consumers remain on solid footing leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance. In Consumer we saw double-digit growth in deposits year-on-year, healthy loan growth across products driving 17% core loan growth for the firm, and high single-digit card sales volumes. The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty. The firm's results included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance. But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year. While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong. Further natural gas, which is a meaningful portion of our portfolio, does remain depressed. We don't feel that current prices are sufficient to spur a meaningful restart of production, and many of the cost reductions and conservation actions that have been taken are not easily and quickly reversed. Therefore, the impact of oil prices is somewhat asymmetric on credit costs. Reserves are name-specific. They're based on downgrades reflecting the actual financial condition and liquidity position of borrowers. As such, we likely will see some incremental reserve build for the rest of the year, but they will be increasingly situation specific, and our ability to estimate them will improve over time. However, using reasonable stress assumptions on draws, downgrades and considering spillover effects to closely related companies, those incremental reserves could reach $500 million plus or minus this year, but with a very high degree of variability around that number. We continue to believe, overall, our client base is relatively well-positioned to weather this downturn, and we will be there to support them whenever feasible. We also monitor for contagion and aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant. Moving on to page two, pausing on this page for just a moment, a few comments on overall revenue and expense. We told you that the first rate hike together with our strong loan growth would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year, that you see here, is in line with that. However, sequentially NII was only up slightly as expected given the absence of certain securities gains that we had in the fourth quarter, as well as day count. Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year primarily driven by the market environment in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Asset Management with the biggest drivers being lower IB fees and Fixed Income market's revenue in both case versus a very strong prior year. Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth. Turning to page three. The firm's fully phased-in advanced CET1 ratio was 11.7%, with standardized at 11.9%. The improvement to both ratios was driven primarily by net capital generation. Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory and as expected, we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity. This also drove a slight increase in RWA net of runoff and model calibration. Firm SLR improved to 6.6%, and we returned $3 billion of net capital to shareholders this quarter, including $1.3 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.44 per share. Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter. Moving on to page four in Consumer & Community Banking. You'll notice that we consolidated Consumer into one page, and for your reference we've included the old pages in the appendix. CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business. And TNS just announced that for the fourth consecutive year, we are the number one consumer retail bank reflecting our ability to attract, satisfy and retain customers. The fundamental business drivers remain strong, with average loans up 12% year-on-year and core loans up 25%, driven by mortgage and auto, but with strength across products. And we saw record deposit growth of $50 billion, up 10%. We added over 1 million households since last year, and our active mobile customer base was up 19%. Revenue of $11.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially if you exclude from last quarter nearly $200 million from the Square IPO and a branch sale. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned, as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment. Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto revenue was up 2% on strong auto loan and lease growth, 8% growth in card sales, and 12% in merchant processing volumes, all of which more than offset the impact of card renegotiation. Expense was down 2% year-on-year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitment, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth. Finally, credit trends in the consumer businesses continue to be favorable. Now turning to page five and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.1 billion and an ROE of 11%. In Banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market which was down 27%. We continue to rank number one in global IB fees and rank number one in three regions, North America, EMEA, and LatAm. It was another strong quarter for advisory, up 8%, versus a wallet that declined 15%. We gained share, ranking number one as we benefited from a number of deals that were announced in 2015 and closed this quarter. Equity underwriting fees were down 49%, in line with the market, as volatility kept issuers on the sidelines. We maintained our number one rank globally and increased our lead. Debt underwriting fees were down 35%. And while we were down more than the market, it can be explained by a tough comparison, with several large acquisition finance deals in the first quarter of last year, as well as being conflicted out of several large deals this quarter. In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting if the recent market improvements continue. Treasury Services revenue was down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructuring. Moving on to Markets, Markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year on year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the first quarter of 2015, where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss franc event. In fact, if you'll indulge me, adjusting for our outperformance year over year, results would have been down by mid-single digits. Fixed income revenue was down 13%. The first couple of months of this quarter, as you know, were challenging across markets, but some stability returned in March. And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize flows. We saw better performance in rates and lower performance across other asset classes. Equity Markets revenue was down 5%. And although flows were steady, idiosyncratic events and sharp moves were tough for our clients both on the way down and back up. Asia equities continued to outperform, driven by market volatility, particularly in Japan. With respect to the second quarter, the relative stability we saw in March has continued into April so far. However, it's also the case that markets are still quite illiquid in certain parts and will be prone to somewhat abrupt corrections. So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, there is still remaining caution for more challenging issuers. Although there has been noise in the data globally, there is an emerging belief that it's fundamentally better but we need to continue to see no downside surprises. And as such, we remain somewhat cautious about the second quarter. Securities Services revenues was $881 million, in line with guidance. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million, mainly driven by CVA on spread widening. Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier. And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year on year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%. Moving on to page six and Commercial Banking, the Commercial Bank generated net income of $500 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 11%. Outside of credit costs for Oil & Gas, the first quarter was very solid performance. Revenue was up 4% year on year, driven by higher loan balances and deposit net interest income, offset by lower IB revenues versus a record last year. Expense of $713 million was up 1% year on year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter, but in line with recent trends if you exclude the impairment taken on leased corporate aircraft last quarter. We saw strong growth in our loan book, with average loan balances up 13% year on year and 3% quarter-on-quarter and with portfolio spreads relatively flat for a couple of quarters now. Our Commercial Real Estate business continued to exceed the industry with growth of 18% year on year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline. In C&I, loans were up 9% year on year, driven by robust originations in Corporate Client Banking. Finally, on Credit, we added $300 million to reserves, mostly related to Oil & Gas, but we continue to see very low net charge-offs. Moving on to page seven and Asset Management, Asset Management reported net income of $587 million with a 30% pre-tax margin and 25% ROE. Revenue of $3 billion was down 1% year-on-year, driven by weaker market and lower brokerage revenues. Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each generally in line with lower market. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 5% year-on-year largely driven by lower performance-based compensation. Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter with strength in fixed income, multi-asset and alternative and including the benefit of a large mandate being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility. Our long-term investment performance remains strong with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Loan balances of $110 billion were up 7% year-on-year with record mortgage balances up 20% and solid growth in traditional lending. Before I move on, as you're aware the Department of Labor issued the final fiduciary rule last week. It's a long and complex set of requirements and details will matter. It will take time to fully digest. On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years and based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful. Perhaps one of the biggest positives is the longer time to implement, which allows us to be even better prepared. Skipping page eight, as we actually have nothing significant to call out on Corporate, I will move onto the outlook on page nine. We've included our guidance from Investor Day on the page. And it's unchanged, so I won't go through it. So just two new points to highlight. For Asset Management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion. And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up but to be less than $3 billion. And obviously, expense will also be flat to up in line with those revenues on performance-based compensation. In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth. But we also expect expenses to increase to about $725 million as we add bankers and execute on our technology and product investment strategies. The upshot of which is we expect pre-provision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter. Before moving to Q&A, I want to make a few comments about the news this morning regarding living wills. Obviously, we were disappointed with the conclusion reached by the joint agencies on our resolution plan. We have taken this planning process very seriously and we believe we've made substantial progress. Having said that, the most important thing is we work with our regulators to understand their feedback fully and in more detail. And we are fully committed to meeting their expectations. So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients. Operator, you can open up for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Burnell. One moment. Please go ahead. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Marianne, maybe a couple of questions on energy. You noted that the provision was slightly above your guidance this quarter relative to what you mentioned you thought it might be in late February. I guess I'm curious in terms of what your expectations are in terms of your guidance relative to potential drawdowns, particularly in the $10 billion of high-yield loans that you have undrawn, and what your ability is to potentially mitigate potential drawdowns based on the financial condition of your borrowers? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, hi, Matt. So the first thing I would say is with respect to Oil & Gas, honestly, I think $529 million is pretty close to $500 million plus or minus, so that was pretty much in line. Where you are seeing it be a little bit higher was on Metals & Mining. We're expecting close to $100 million, and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen. It doesn't change the overall sort of perspective for us. With respect to draws, when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. And clearly, we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary and in other cases we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases. But we will expect to see some draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. And I want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete, so this is not just Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining. As the NAIC codes would suggest, we've looked at very closely related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. So we're trying to be very complete. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And we've yet to take a loss. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We have taken a couple. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : (20:00) Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Nothing \u2013 not very much. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Fair enough, that makes sense. But that dovetails nicely actually into my follow-up. In terms of the wholesale non-accrual balances, those were up about $1.2 billion quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us a sense as to how much of that was energy and Metals & Mining? And were there other areas of the portfolio that added to that? And what's your outlook for wholesale non-accruals over the course of the next couple of quarters? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So of the $1.2 billion, $1 billion was a combination of Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, so the vast majority. And outside of that, consistent with my comments on contagion, there's not any sort of thematic, other noteworthy thing to mention to you. And obviously, as we continue to watch the sort of cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more NPLs. But I gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserves, so they will go up, but not to numbers that I would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Just one follow-up. What was the drawn-on energy facilities this quarter? It doesn't seem to be too big. And then related to that, what's the reserve as a percentage of drawn credit right now? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The draws were about $1.3 billion in the quarter, so some but not excessive. And after the reserves that we put up in the first quarter, the coverage ratio is 6.3%. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : 6.3%, all right. I also think... Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : what is the number on balance sheet? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That is on the balance sheet. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : And then maybe a little bit of different question... Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sorry, Glenn, just on that 6.3%, that's the firm. If you look in the Commercial Bank, obviously, it's higher. So you've got a sort of different portfolio mix in the Commercial Bank versus the CIB. So for some parts of our portfolio, it's closer to 9% or 10% and in other parts it's lower. Sorry, your second question? Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : I appreciate that and I thank you. Yeah. The other question is on growth. We've been waiting for a long time, but you've been seeing great growth across a lot of different products. I mean, CRE up 18%, in the Commercial Bank, C&I up 9%. At this stage of the cycle, I appreciate the Consumer has shown a lot of strength, is there any growth where we scratch our heads and said, wow, is that growing too much? It sounds funny for me to be asking for less growth, but just curious to get your thoughts. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a perfectly reasonable question. And obviously, when we look at growth in CRE or the Commercial Real Estate businesses of 18%, it's an obvious question are you doing something different? And the answer is no, we're not. We haven't changed our geographies. We haven't changed our risk appetite. It just simply indicates that we have a good process, and we are continuing to focus on our sort of core capabilities and our core risk segments. But we've been able to take advantage of the opportunity because our process is better, and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless to a degree, given that the CMBS market has been somewhat disrupted. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi. Good morning. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I have a question on the living wills. The indication today was that there were four areas that you needed to enhance. Liquidity was one of those, and I was a little surprised to see that given the strength of your liquidity book. I guess what I'm wondering is does the living will submission and the changes that you have to make have an impact on your current business at all? In other words, do you need to build liquidity to meet the requirements that the regulators have, or this is in an obviously worst-case scenario you would build at that time? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Betsy, obviously, with having only received the specific feedback less than 24 hours ago, we still have to get into the analysis phase about what it all means. I would start with your opening comments that considering our liquidity you were surprised, this doesn't appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of JPMorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know; but it's really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we fund our entity. So I can't tell you with any clarity exactly what will be required as we get into the analysis. It wouldn't be my core expectation that it would require us to do a meaningful overall new liquidity action, but we have to do the work. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So as we think about the implications of this morning's announcement, it's around your planning and procedures as opposed to a likely impact on the business operations today and the results that you can generate. Is that a reasonable conclusion? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, just based on our preliminary read, I think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectations of the regulators and our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things. So I don't know that there are going to be significant changes. It's not my primary expectation that there would be, but we do need to have a moment to go through the details. Operator : Your next... Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The liquidity of the company is extraordinary. We have $400 billion in central banks around the world, $300 billion of AA+ short duration securities, just about $300 billion of very short-term secured, really top-quality repo type of stuff like that. The trading book is $300 billion, which is mostly very liquid kind of stuff, so the liquidity of the company is extraordinary. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I would say just, again, we need to do the work and we need to figure out, obviously, what the response to that will be. But it is encouraging that some plans were found to be credible for large systemic financial institutions. And if they have been able to adequately show their preparedness, we're confident we should be able to do the same. We just need to make sure that we understand the details of what it is that we don't have in our plans today that we need to change, and we're committed to doing it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Marianne, can you expand upon your comments in your opening dialogue about the energy exposure? You're not too worried about the contagion risk, but you did say that there are a couple of specific issues relating to some very closely related companies. Can you give us more color on what you're referring to? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, absolutely. So I just want to \u2013 if you use the industry codes the way that you could if you weren't to expand your thinking to just what is technically considered to be an oil and gas company, you would miss out on, for example, a marine shipping company that all they do is ship oil. And therefore, their financial condition and their performance is going to be directly related to the health of the energy sector. Those companies, we have identified them specifically, they are managed within our energy risk team. They are not managed by a different team. So I was simply saying that some of the companies that we are watching and in one or two small cases that had experienced some stress, are not traditional energy companies but their condition is directly related to oil and gas. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. And then on the loan growth, which is obviously very strong, what are your people on the front lines saying about commercial real estate? Are there any changes in terms of underwriting metrics that your front line people are seeing since we are starting to see in certain markets like multifamily, which you guys have already identified have some weak spots, are there any other underwriting issues that are cropping up now that you didn't see three months ago or six months ago? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, and obviously not for us, I would say that it's competitive. The C&I space is very competitive. Commercial Real Estate is also competitive, but it's not irrational and we aren't seeing, or at least we are not seeing very irrational proposals on structure and risk. Meanwhile, we haven't changed our risk appetite. We haven't changed our underwriting standards. We continue to have lower LTVs and higher debt coverage ratios pretty consistently, consistent geography. So speaking for JPMorgan specifically, there has been no change in our underwriting standards. In fact, if anything since the last crisis, obviously, or the last recession, we've tightened our underwriting standards and we've moved away from some of the riskier types of that business, so homebuilders and a lot of construction loan business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. That was a very serious CEO letter you had in the annual report, but two questions related to that. One would be, you, Jamie, indicate the potential for higher interest rates, and I'm just looking for some more color into why you think that's the case, and if you're preparing the bank for a scenario of higher rates or if you're just trying to just set a tone at the top or perhaps be contrarian. I know you gave some technical factors in the CEO letter. And then the second thing is just the contrast between what you have in the CEO letter, liquidity, trading governance oversight with the living will letter that came out today. And just to follow up on the earlier question, do you simply have to write a better resolution plan, or might you have to change a little bit the way you do business? And does this make you have a more conservative CCAR ask? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Mike. I'll start and then Jamie can add to it. So on the interest rate point, the comments are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the U.S. economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the markets, global growth will continue, albeit at a moderate pace. And obviously, stability in the markets in March has continued to help us with that thesis. And so that coupled with the fact that the Fed themselves \u2013 while they're dovish in their narrative in the minutes and also their dots are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates is quieting. So we don't particularly run the company with a day-to-day view on what's going to happen with interest rates. We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there are no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways. So we are positioned for rising rates. It is our central case that that will happen. The market is pricing less than one hike in this year. The Fed dots say two. Our research says two. We're just going to have to wait and see. I'll also start and then Jamie can jump in on the living wills thing. We have to take it at face value in discussions with our regulators that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules, whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. And if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the company the way that we think is best for our clients and communities around the world. And so at this point, we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us and resubmit a plan for assessments that we hope will be credible. And that's certainly what we will commit to do, and that's what we're focused on. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Was there anything else from Jamie on that? Because if we compare and contrast the CEO letter to what the regulators just said about you guys, it's not completely consistent. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think it's inconsistent. We're trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules, and all the requirements. We've been doing that now for five years or six years. It is five \u2013 it's been six years since Dodd-Frank was passed. They have their job to do and we have to conform to it. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I know it's easy to overlook the first few statements where there's an acknowledgment that progress has been made. And none of the feedback in the letter negates the significant progress across the industry on capital liquidity, stress testing. So it is consistent, but we have more work to do and we'll do it. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And on the interest rate stuff, I wasn't predicting it. I'm simply saying I think there is a chance it will be different than what people expect and it will be a little \u2013 as I said, it will be gradual until it's sudden. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : I wonder on trading. I appreciate that you reported first so you haven't seen the market yet, but two questions around the whole thesis, the last man standing versus restructures. One, do you have any sense of whether your performance overall on really FICC represented market share gains or not this quarter? And then two, with some of the guidance coming out of the European banks in particular being very poor and some of the restructurings may be accelerating steam, is there any thought around comp and maybe using that as a lever to improve returns over the remainder of the year and into next? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So obviously, we're the first to read out. And it's very difficult when you think about performance because you also have to think about the relative performance in the comparable periods and prior years and the like. So I would say that down mid-single digits adjusted for what we would consider to have been outperformance last year is really quite good performance. So I don't know that we gained share, but I certainly think we've protected share. And it may differ across the different product sets, but I think in general, we feel pretty good about our performance, and we don't know anything to the contrary. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I would just add that $5 billion plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this I'd look at it as good. We're earning decent returns. We have good margins. I'm not quite sure about share, but it was quite \u2013 I would look at it as quite a good performance, and trading losses were, what we had was six days you said to me, or... Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Six days, yeah. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Six days, they... Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : . Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : They were (34:59) like $40,000. So the actual results are just \u2013 that's really good. I look at that as a very healthy business. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And then with respect to the sort of restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly defined, including in compensation for better performance, we pay for performance and we pay risk-adjusted returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time. And you can see our comp to revenue ratio of 33% (sic) [32%] this quarter is in line with the ratio in the first quarter of last year and in fact the first quarter of the year before. So lower, obviously, on lower revenues, but a fair pay for the performance. And obviously, we intend to ensure that we are competitive, but we're not going to take any direct action as a result of that in terms of the... Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We also got some big deals done near the end of the quarter in Western Digital and Numericable, which is part of sales and trading. And we also got a \u2013 we did this I thought a very creative Chase. I'll probably call it Chase Trust. It's the first real securitization in a long time in a mortgage business where you do revenue risk-sharing, and I think it's quite good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Just a question on expenses. First, was there any legal expense in the quarter? And then just a broader question, Marianne, are the incremental expense saves you're getting from your programs falling to the bottom line, or is it \u2013 some of it getting reinvesting? Like in CCB, I noticed the head count is up a little bit on page 11 just the last couple of quarters. Does that reflect like reinvestment of the cost saves? And then just on the legal side if you had anything this quarter. Thanks. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on legal, I would \u2013 so the number is circa zero pre-tax. It's actually slightly positive after-tax. We did some true-ups so far, assessment on penalties. So actually, net-net about zero this quarter, which I'll take it for the quarter, but it doesn't necessarily predict the future. In terms of expenses, so we talked at Investor Day, Gordon in particular but also Daniel, that we are continuing to invest in our businesses and across the board, in fact, adding bankers and technology and digital, digitizing, et cetera. So we continue to do that across the businesses. And I mentioned in the CCB page that the net expenses, albeit down includes self-funding $200 million of incremental investments year-over-year and growth. But you did notice the head count in the Consumer Businesses is up slightly and that's a combination of the investments we're making in technology and digital; that's about 500 of the heads, and the other 1,500 is increasing part-time staffing in the branches so that we have flexibility to make sure that we have loading at the right times of day for making sure the customer experience is good. So I would characterize it all as very consistent and yes we continue to invest, and that is in part what you're seeing in the head count in CCB. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And you saw a new credit card, Freedom Unlimited, 1.5% back. We're doing a lot of stuff in Chase Pay. You heard \u2013 so, the Starbucks thing, we are part of top digital site \u2013 and we continue to win awards in the consumer banks, so we will always be investing there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning. You're fielding a lot of questions on energy credit quality. But taking a step back, given that the delinquency statistics outside of energy still remain fairly stable, could you give us an outlook for how you think credit quality trends will play out for the rest of the year if the base case is slow growth in the U.S.? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it is our expectation across both the Consumer and the Wholesale businesses outside of energy that the credit trends will remain favorable. Credit will be relatively benign. We're not expecting to see material increases except for the fact that we're growing our loan portfolios. So when we did Investor Day we talked about charge-offs this year will go up year-on-year, and they'll go up to potentially as high as $4.75 billion, but half of that would be on the back of the fact that we're growing our portfolios. And so you will just have natural sort of BAU levels of charge-off from that and then the over half would be on energy. So we're not expecting or seeing at this point anything other than good credit quality the rest of 2016 outside of the obvious. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And just one more follow-up question on the living will, could you help us understand what you think the regulators meant in terms of if the remediation is not met by October 1 of this year that there could be more stringent prudential requirements? Could that possibly mean higher capital or liquidity standards if the expectations aren't met by October? I guess we always thought of the living will as more of a cost issue rather than a further tax on regulatory ratios. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I will start by saying that as you know our regulators have extraordinary powers over a wide range of requirements for us regardless, and many ways of influencing those, and you're familiar with most of them. It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if a remediation is not satisfactory with or cured within a two-year period, there is a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide and may jointly decide to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions. So obviously, they do have those powers, October is not that far away. We're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate the issues. And then we have another submission in July of 2017. So not to suggest that we won't fully remediate to the very best of our ability, but the living will process I expect to continue to be somewhat iterative over the next several cycles, and we will continue to push ourselves to raise the bar, and I'm certain that the bar will continue to be raised on us as it should. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: If I look at the first quarter net interest income, which was at least better than what I had, good NIM and think about your full-year outlook, if I take it literally, it implies flattish net interest income dollars from here. And I'm just wondering if that's too literal of interpretation or if maybe there are some offsets to the loan growth we say over the long-term rates as we think about the rest of the year. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans we'd expect our NII to go up by $2 billion. And so you're right, if you look at the run rate right now that would be relatively flat from here. I think in our favor because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of dovish Fed comments there has been a lower re-price just in the industry generally, so that's in our favor but \u2013 and you know we're much more sensitive to the front-ended rate. So while we're not suggesting that the long end of the curve has no impact, it's relatively modest, so $2 billion may be a little more, the biggest driver of significantly higher NII above that guidance would be if we had another hike earlier than December. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then just separately, any comments on the Treasury's ruling on inversion as you think about M&A kind of broadly speaking for the industry and for you guys specifically and if you can frame how much that's driven your M&A revenues in the past or the industry. Any color around that would be helpful. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I'm not going to talk specifically about the Treasury's actions other than saying that we would support fair tax reform in general. With respect to the impact on our business, either historically or going forward, it wouldn't be zero and it wouldn't be significant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Maybe we could talk a little bit about CCAR. I've had some investors express concern about the Fed's inclusion of negative rates. Have you found that to be difficult in terms of modeling? And overall I guess given the improvement in \u2013 on the flip side given the improvement in your capital ratios, do you think that there's \u2013 you should be able to see some improvement or increase in CCAR into \u2013 now that you've looked at it for a few months? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So obviously, I'm not going to be able to talk specifically about our plans that we've submitted because we just submitted them and we haven't had any feedback and they're confidential. But I will tell you that, obviously, negative rates. It was the first time this has been in the scenario. It is not the first time we have talked about it and it's not the first time that we've experienced it, at least in other parts of the world, in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. So we have had continued discussions. We understand broadly what we think we would do and what would happen to our balance sheet. We can model it and we can effect it. So in that sense now, I mean, obviously, we'll continue to work that process through if it continues to be a feature of CCAR. You're absolutely right that year-over-year our launch point is a higher level of capital. And our balance sheet and our credit quality continues to improve, and our risk levels have not materially changed. So as a general matter, we would hope and we've also added prefs. So as a general matter, we would hope to have incremental capacity, but nothing inconsistent with what we have said externally, which is that the board would like over time to continue to have the capacity to potentially increase dividends, and that we would likely take capacity to within a reasonable range, repurchase our stock and that's the framework that we have used to submit our plan. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So, Marianne, within the Asset Management segment, you noted that the revenues were down in line with the market. But if we isolate the fee income components to exclude some of the IB (46:03) gains you highlighted as well as other income, the revenues declined by double-digit both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, which is a bit more pronounced than what we had expected. And I was hoping you could speak to maybe some of the factors outside of the market declines that are maybe impacting revenues in that business, specifically what you're seeing in terms of retail engagement and maybe whether you've seen any improvement in sentiment now that the markets have recovered pretty nicely off the February trough. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So if I do the sort of \u2013 I don't want to use the word core. If I adjust for the full impact of the asset sale that was in the quarter, not just the $150 million in this quarter, but also the revenues that were present with respect to that in the first quarter of last year, my adjusted revenues are down about 4% to a market that on average, while I appreciate that it recovered in March, but the market on average for the quarter was down around 5%. So we would characterize that as generally in line. And similarly, if you do adjustments on the balance sheet side, the assets under management and client assets. So certainly, you can speak to Jason afterwards and reconcile our numbers so that we're not confusing each other. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: The retail engagement. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Retail engagement, so retail engagement picked up in March, as you would expect. We saw positive flows. We obviously saw a negative flow for the quarter in equities, that's not surprising. And then we saw positive flows, particularly in multi-asset, so we did see some reasonably healthy retail flows in the quarter, but primarily in March and somewhat offset by outflows in equities. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Excellent, thank you. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, Marianne, a quick question on NIM here. Can you talk about how sustainable you think the NIM expansion might be and whether or not there's anything one-time in the numbers we should adjust for? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As luck would have it, in this quarter there is nothing one-time that you need to adjust for. Last quarter there obviously was, and so we would expect that our NIM should be stable to improving over the course of 2016, the extent to which it would improve obviously depending upon what happens in terms of gradually rising rates. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the energy exposures in the loan book, can you comment on maybe whether or not some of the equity capital raising that we've seen in the energy space has perhaps taken some of the tail risk away from that book? And then is it possible also to update us on the criticized exposures in oil and gas? I believe in the 10-K it was somewhere around $4.5 billion at year end. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, so with respect to equity capital raises, obviously to a degree that would be true, although those companies that were able to access the equity capital markets are not those that are experiencing the most stress. So obviously all other things equal, it's a positive, but I'm not necessarily thinking it's going to take significant steam or the pressure off. With respect to the second part of your question? I'm so sorry. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : C&C. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jason will get back to you. I'm sorry, I don't have the answer. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : No problem, thanks so much. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Marianne, can you comment on what competitive conditions are like in the credit card market currently and if there has been any change around the intensity of competition for co-brand and rewards? And I think, Jamie, you alluded to the launch of a new product. I'd love to get an update on your initial thoughts about how that's going. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So no, nothing has changed in the card competitive landscape, including in co-brand. It's still very competitive, albeit that we are \u2013 we saw a little bit of deceleration in sales growth year over year last year and we've seen that trend back positively for us this year. So we feel good about that and we've been increasing our marketing spend. And as Jamie just said, we launched Freedom Unlimited quite recently. And it has been quite recent, but early feedback is very positive with respect to Freedom. We're seeing 50% increases in activity and interest. There's going to be a degree of cannibalization of other products. We would expect that, but so far so good. And we just like to give our customers choices, and it's been favorably received. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great, thank you. And auto has been a big area of focus, and you touched on it certainly during your Investor Day. But in the mid-cycle range, is there anything going on, on a macro level that would suggest some significant likelihood of credit quality deterioration? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, the Manheim is down slightly. We continue to believe and expect that it will continue to trend downwards. And so losses per unit will continue to trend upwards just given where it is today and also the amount of leased inventory that will ultimately go into the used car space over the course of the next several years. However, the fundamentals are still good. The market is still solid. We had pulled back on subprime a while ago. It's a small part of our originations. And so other than seeing some delinquencies pick up as expected in some of the energy-related space but not very significantly, there's nothing at the moment that's on the burner. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : For us. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : For us. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I do think you'll see issues in the market, though. Operator : Your next question comes to line of Paul Miller with FBR. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, thank you very much. In the Mortgage Banking segment, you wrote down the MSR by almost $0.9 billion. Were there any hedging gains? I couldn't find them in the documents. Any hedging gains to offset that? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the MSR P&L for the quarter was a positive $124 million, and they're a combination of BAU immaterial factors that added up to that. And probably about half of it was a combination of hedged performance in the market. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. And then on the Mortgage Banking side, have you been seeing \u2013 you saw the MBA today release that purchase applications are the highest since 2010 or something on that order. Are you seeing the spring buying season, especially on the purchase side, starting to pick up? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, so our purchase applications are up 30% I think year on year. We're continuing to see positive momentum in that space, and we are seeing spring activity continuing to be robust as expected. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning, just two quick follow-ups on the fee side. Understanding that market dependence is built into the outlook to get to $50 billion of fees for the year, I'm just wondering. Have we now run-rated the combination of the business repositioning, the card revenue run rate, and the toughness of this first quarter? I guess the question is really what are the things that you expect to get better from the first quarter on the fee side outside of normal seasonality? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So in terms of run-rated, the two biggest drivers of the walk that we gave at Investor Day were the card co-brand renegotiations and the Mortgage Banking non-interest revenue. I would just point out that while we are seeing some of the incremental impact of card renegotiations, that will play out over the course of the year. But on the positive side \u2013 and on the positive side, Mortgage Banking just given where rates were over the quarter has sort of been positive relative to the central expectations when we did Investor Day. So those two things are worth noting, but we are seeing really quite good drivers in noninterest revenue drivers across the Consumer space generally in debit, investments, in fees and accounts in the sort of 4%-5% range and sometimes in the range higher than that. So we're continuing to see exactly what we expected which is the majority of our businesses will continue to deliver mid to high single-digit growth and they seem set to do that. The Card impact will be what it will be and Mortgage NIR will end up down year-over-year, whether it's $700 million or $600 million, we'll see. And so the biggest driver of what the end result will be is going to be Markets. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Yes, okay. And I know it's a smaller line item, but just noticing the guide for security services to be flat from here. There's always some seasonality in there too, but I'm just wondering if you can just give a comment about what you're seeing in that business and are there any incremental challenges that leave you kind of with a flat outlook. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, look, the business is not immune to markets either. So obviously, as you look at their performance for the quarter, our fees have been impacted by lower asset levels, and we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification just getting the tail of that out of their performance. We are also seeing the benefit of higher rates, so I would characterize the majority of those negatives on lower fees and simplification as being behind us, so the trajectory if rates continue to rise would be upwards, but that's why we said market-dependent. We were not expecting our performance to go down from here, flat to up but depending on rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP : Yes. Good morning. The question is really on the compensation ratio. You've obviously done a fantastic job on the cost base, but one of the issues that strikes me is clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business, your comp down about $400 million compared to the first quarter or the quarter of last year. And obviously, what we've experienced generally is you holding the ratio reasonably steady for the second to third quarter and then truing up with a lower ratio in the fourth quarter. If I'm looking at the estimates we have for revenues on a well-known provider of data, we've got pretty flat revenues being forecast by people like me whether we're right or wrong. Should we be thinking about how you're going to build a bonus pool against this background and whether we should be looking at thinking or thinking that you're going to have to retain the comp ratio at a pretty similar level through the year if indeed we don't see any uptick in revenues and they remain reasonably flat? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the comp... Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd just use 32%. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Well, we've given the range 30% to 35%. We've been at the lower end of that range when we performed very strongly. We could drift up if we performed less strongly. We pay for performance, and I think we did a good job in the first quarter. Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP : Okay, thanks. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have among the lowest ratios and we're paying our people properly as well. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And consistently. Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP : Yeah. But I'm by no means arguing about the quality of the ratio. I'm just intrigued because clearly what we're seeing on most leaders and indeed in Europe is the difficulty of building a pool when you've been so used to having a very strong first quarter, obviously, makes it quite difficult. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, but... Chris Wheeler - Atlantic Equities LLP : Maybe just as a follow-up, which is vaguely related, could I just ask, what you talked earlier about where there's a question earlier about competition and picking up market share which indeed you clearly have. But one of the questions I perhaps just wanted to ask is an area you've been pushing hard on is equity, cash equities in particular. My sense is that actually a lot of the players including the Europeans who were doing massive restructurings are putting more capital into equities on the back of the fact that it's a lower capital business. And therefore they think they can get higher returns and just maybe that's why Nomura pulled out of European equities yesterday. What are you seeing in the equity space in particular because I don't \u2013 I'm not seeing as much sort of withdrawal as we have done in the fixed space? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, that's very fair and we've talked about it pretty often that people when they restructure, they restructure out of the things that they were less strong at, less profitable at and in many cases they double down where they continue to have strength and we are seeing that and that's what we mean when we say there's always someone less to fiercely compete in every part of our business and equities is no exception, it's not the poster child for that. However, the equities business here at JPMorgan, we've rebuilt our technology platform. We have rebuilt the prime \u2013 when we built the prime brokerage international capabilities. The two of those work hand in glove, and we have every opportunity to continue to gain share and win. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And we've done very well gaining share in electronic trading and the prime broker has been built in Asia and Europe where we had some weaknesses. So you've seen our share go up and we intend to win it. We have top-notch research, which obviously helps drive the equity business, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Marianne, just as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly on the $500 million of incremental reserve build for energy for the remainder of the year, that's for the total of the following nine months. Is that correct? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I mean, give or take? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Give or take. And \u2013 that's right. Obviously, there's a high degree of variability around it. If we had complete ability to understand it, we would lean into those reserves, but there's a \u2013 it's name-specific. It's situation-specific. It would evolve over time. We just wanted to give you an indication that there's likely to be some more costs. It could be plus or minus quite a bit from that, because we've had to make some stress assumptions in there, but $500 million for nine months, yes. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you and then I know there was the energy-specific Shared National Credit exam that the first quarter results for the industry will reflect similar to your own. But we also have the traditional Shared National Credit exam that's been done for 20-plus years. Any color on how that's going, the normal Shared National Credit exam? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. No, Gerard, I'm not going to make any comments about SNC, except to say that everything that we know about SNC is reflected in our results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Two quick follow-ups, Marianne. I'm getting a couple of questions about just the math on the energy reserve ratio. I think you mentioned 6.3%. Just to be clear, is that the reserve for loans, over-funded loans, and then there's an additional reserve for unfunded commitments? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct, yes. John Eamon McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then could you tell us the size of your energy commitments and whether they've changed at all this quarter? Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : They changed by a couple of billion dollars on a single name that we like. Up. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks very much. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, wait. Before you all go... Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, yes. Yes. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We should say good-bye to Sarah Youngwood, who goes on to a bigger and brighter job as CFO of the Consumer Bank. And she did an outstanding job, and she's being succeeded by Jason, who's going to say hi right now. Jason Scott - Head- Investor Relations : Hello, hi. Jamie Dimon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So congratulations. Really, you guys have done an outstanding job. Marianne Lake - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ditto that. Thank you, everyone. I nearly forgot. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you and good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. And while there were no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items, primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you will hear about as I go through the presentation. And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion. Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on two topics that are top of mind. First an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved which means underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB. Although the oil and gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition, outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our wholesale or consumer credit portfolios. Second on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk off environment and following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well absorbing the volatility and despite significant increases in volumes our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance. With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and possible things specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and U.K. clients across businesses and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction cost so that they will be manageable for the company. Moving on to page two. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year-on-year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit re-price to-date has remained low coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was flat year-on-year with the increase in markets revenue being offset by declines in IB fees as well as asset management. Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect the full year expense $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the FDIC surcharge in the third and fourth quarters. Moving on to capital on page three. The firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, which standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth. This quarter, we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we are pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion. Moving on to page four and consumer and community banking. Consumer and community banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Average loans were up 11% with core loans up 23%, driven by mortgage and auto but with continued strength across all products. And we had record business banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and with a strong pipeline up 17%. We added nearly two million households year-on-year with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among U.S. banks up 18%. Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII of the added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up, but flat if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, with growth in card and auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down to 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continued to be favorable with charge-offs in card trending up slightly. Over the last two, three years we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card, in the prime and near-prime space. As this vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate and performance is in line with our expectations. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly and as such, we built $250 million of reserve this quarter. Moving to auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry and with a very sharp focus on avoiding mislayering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations and we have built $50 million in reserve this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against this reserve build, we saw releases of $125 million principally driven by mortgage. Turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion and an ROE of 15%. In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked number one in global IB fees, ranking number one in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter that we ranked number two globally and grew share by 50 basis points. In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter, but was down from a strong quarter last year with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank number one globally growing share by 30 basis points and we ranked number one in every product category for the first half of this year. Debt underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with the market which was down 4% and we ranked number two globally. Moving on the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance. Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8% reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year-on-year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our client's needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity. Fixed-income revenue of $4 billion was up 35%, versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows and performance also improved in credit and securitized products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity. Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve build for oil and gas. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year with a comp to revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%. Moving on to page six and commercial banking. Overall, a solid quarter for commercial banking, with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year-on-year. And we continued to see strong momentum in loan growth with average loan balances up 13% year on year. Commercial real estate loans grew 18% reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market. Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth and expense of $731 million was up 4% reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved and outside of energy, credit performance continued to be strong. Moving on to page seven and asset management. Asset management reported net income of $521 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to fill the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower legal expense and recall that the prior year included a non-core loss. AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year-on-year, respectively. We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows in to our fixed income products with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by mortgage up 20%. Turning to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million which included two notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter, offset by a number of tax items, including addition to tax reserves for developments relating to open order periods. As a result of the tax items, our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%, adjusted it would have been closer to 36%. Now turning to page nine and moving on to the outlook. To reiterate, our firmwide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent. So to wrap-up, a strong quarter reflecting our leadership positions and the benefits our diversified franchise with the consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in markets continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment. And just before I open up the Q&A, just for those of you on the phone, Jamie is here. He has a very hoarse voice. So we will try and use despairingly. But if you hear him coarsely, that's why. Operator, open up the line please. Operator : [AUDIO GAP] Comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Brian. Brian Foran : I know it's very early and it is probably limited in what you say, because you mentioned, it depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works, but is there any kind of qualitative thoughts you can give us around the operational and/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops, legal entity, restructuring, net impacts of moving people versus lower cost geography, some things like that? Marianne Lake : Brian, I know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say but the truth of the matter is, it's very, very early days as the new government is just forming as we speak. Negotiations need to be given some time to unfold and take shape. And so it's really too early to hypothesize. But we would hope that we can continue to operate where we are right now. But we will just continue to evaluate the landscape, as I am sure you will, over the coming weeks, months and quarters and plan accordingly. The most important thing is that we intend to continue to support our European franchising clients throughout. Brian Foran : I appreciate that. And maybe switching gears, you mentioned the consumer business was firing on all cylinders. Clearly there is some nervousness in the market that the credit cycle is turning. So I wonder if you can tough on two things which are, maybe a little bit more detail on the seasoning impact you saw? You mentioned, in card, is it just seasoning or is there any like-for-like deterioration? And then in auto, you mentioned risk layering. What particular factors are you seeing layered in to underwriting box that make you concerned right now? Marianne Lake : Yes. So on the card space, as you know we have loans running off or replacing them all the time over the course of the last couple years. Since the end of 2013, we have made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully and we have been monitoring it very closely. And what we are seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. And these loans are coming on at higher risk adjusted margins. So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. so nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite. And with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you have already seen used car prices soften some and they are likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we have been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we been going through the cycle and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry but we have been very, very careful and low percentage of subprime originations very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. So nothing in our -- and remember for this year, I think the charge-off rate is going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long run average of more like 60. So we are reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down and we are being thoughtful about that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just talk a little bit about the net interest margin and the outlook there. It was down five basis points. It looked like it was mostly in the funding cost. I just wanted to get a sense of what was driving? I think long-term was up. Trading, liability cost were up. Can you just give us a sense of what's going on there and how to think about that going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes. So at the risk of not getting overly complicated, the long-term debt expense to our NII was flat with loan growth and NII loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense which was largely to do with the hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small move in currency levels and currency basis. So I would honestly characterize it, not to underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. Looking forward -- and so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat, you have the balance sheet growing as we expected both on loans and trading assets. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points. But we would be looking for our NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter and so our NIM to be relatively stable. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the prior question on credit. How should we think about the provisioning going forward in consumer? Is that going to be a consistent build? Or is that a catchup that we saw this quarter? Marianne Lake : So I would say, there is going to be two things. First of all, obviously, when you talk about consumer, it dwarfed by cards. So let's start with cards. We are growing the portfolio. We added 4% core loans year-over-year in card and so naturally as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves. So there will be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest. And then as these vintages continue to season, we have been experiencing very, very low loss rates, circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly. And so there will be a little bit of rates impact too but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons. And similarly volume wise in auto, we should see some adds but again, in comparison to card, modest. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. So my first question is, given how well JPMorgan did on the fee car relative to last year's results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share, especially end markets? Marianne Lake : So as you know, Erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client franchise and making sure that we are supporting our clients and then secondarily with a view to all of our binding constraints. So we will provide capital and access to the CIB, but also taking into consideration our overall objective is making sure that we stay in the 3.5% bucket. So we will continue to try and find capacity to be able to recycle it and grow high ROE business. Erika Najarian : Great. And was there anything to call out on the equities, the $1.6 billion equities number that could be a little bit more one-time in nature for the quarter? Marianne Lake : Not anything significant, no. I think you have got to compare it to the prior year, which was stronger, particularly this time last year in Asia and that's less true today, stronger in Europe, less strong in Asia. It's more of a regional story than any particularly significant items. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay, two questions. One, on the outlook page, I see on the printed page, it's the same as what you had last quarter for the company overall, obviously, but I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side, right, $2 billion year-on-year plus. Is that the rate nuance that you are trying to communicate? Marianne Lake : Yes. Two pieces to the story. So yes, the guidance is $2 billion plus year-on-year. You recall, when we came in to Investor Day, we said we would expect $2 billion rate flat. It looks like rates will be flat at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year. But you have seen already in the first two quarters that year-over-year we are up $1.4 billion, so we were doing better now on a combination of lower deposit bases, re-prices and also on strong loan growth. But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower tenure. It's not significant but it will offset that to a degree. So we would expect our NII to be between $2 billion to $2.5 billion, up year-on-year, largely strong loan growth, lower re-price. Betsy Graseck : And then on the loan growth side, you have been funding this in part from just a mix shift, right, where your loan to deposit ratio has moved up very nicely. It's still very low at 66%, but up two percentage points Q-on-Q and up from 61% year-on-year. And I am just wondering how far do you think you can take that before you might want to look to fund loan growth with deposit growth more ratably? Marianne Lake : Okay. So obviously we have been doing a combination. We have been growing our deposits more strongly than the industry. So we continue to be net net attracting more deposits than the industry and also as you say, a mix shift out of securities and into loans. Our outlook for loan growth for the range of this year is to be at the higher end of our range. We said 10% to 15% core loan growth and at this point, demand still seems robust. So we would expect to be at the higher end of that range and we certainly have been this quarter. So at this point, I would say that it's a combination of factors. And remember, the way we think about investment, security portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the firm's duration of equity. So all of those factors will contribute. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Just one more rate question. As you mentioned, you are supersensitive on the front end of the curve and you just alluded to, the curve is flatter. I am curious about that great chart that you rolled out on Investor Day that talks about, we make $3 billion more through 2018 if rates stay flat and $6 billion more if the curve goes down the implied path. The implied path is now lower. I am just curious how much those numbers change if the current curve holds? Marianne Lake : Okay. Glenn, I apologize, but I think it was actually, we make $3.5 billion on the rates implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. But in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now just because things can change so quickly, I will just focus on 2017. Rates flat from here, so with the tenure of about 1.5 and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth notwithstanding any long end pressure, we would still expect year-over-year our NII next year to be up between $1 and $1.5 billion. Implied, which is actually not that much different from that, so it does have about 20 basis points better long end rates by the end of 2017, but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 would be about $0.5 billion more than that. Glenn Schorr : That is perfect. Thank you. Other question was, there are some regulars chirping a little bit about concerns in commercial real estate. Some of the other banks have mentioned that you are growing like a weed and your credit is great. So can we just talk a little bit about what you think you are doing differently to both, get that growth and then what you doing to avoid mistakes of the past, that will be good? Marianne Lake : Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed. Glenn Schorr : Fair. Marianne Lake : So look, I will say a couple of things. So first is, a lot of that growth is commercial term lending and it is the case that we have the technology and the process that has speed and certainty of execution and competitive funding cost. So it is the case that if the value proposition that we are able to bring to clients that differentiates us, we are able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is. And secondarily, we are really concentrated on simplified supply constrained markets, low rent-stabilized. So these are not the same properties that had problems in the past. Since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at the our underwriting and there are some things and some regions and some products that we either don't do or do significantly less of. So we are very, very careful but we are looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial real estate portfolio right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Marianne Lake : Hi Matt. Matt Burnell : Hi Marianne. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the cost side of things where the overhead ratios, both in the CIB and the consumer bank dropped really materially quarter-over-quarter. I guess I am just looking for some guidance here in terms of how much of the expense initiatives that you have already been talking about, both in the CIB and the CCB, how much progress did you make in this quarter on that? And was that an outsized contributor to the improvement in the overhead ratios? Marianne Lake : So I would say, in the CIB there is also a revenue story. So you need to consider both factors. Matt Burnell : Sure. Marianne Lake : Yes. So let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments and you will recall that whether you remember, a $4.8 billion number or $5.5 billion number in total, we about 70% of the way through delivering against that across the CIB and the CCB at the end of the second quarter. We continue to make progress. In the CCB, obviously, it is generally more progressive. And the CIB, it is a bit more about technology and operations and it takes some time to deliver that. But fundamentally we continue to chalk through that and we will get there over the course of the next several quarters. So I would say in line with our expectations and it is a contributing factor. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just in the CIB specifically you mentioned the comp ratio there was 30%. That's sort of at the low end of the range that you typically talk about, 30% to 35%. I am presuming that's largely driven by the better-than-expected revenues. Was there anything else going on there? Or was that just pretty much a result of a benign revenue, a relatively benign revenue environment? Marianne Lake : So I would say, the comp revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. Obviously we try to give the range to give people an idea, but we pay competitively and we pay for risk adjusted performance. But there is nothing notable going on. We have been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Marianne Lake : Good morning Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. How is CIB doing in Europe and against European bank competitors in terms of revenue growth, share, the degree of competition? Some competitors are pulling back and you guys have stayed the course. Are you seeing the benefit from that? Marianne Lake : So it's always a little tricky. The share thing is going to become clearer with the rearview mirror than it is necessary a moment in time. It does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively not just against European bank, but just generally and not just in Europe, but generally because we, as you say, have continued to be there for clients across products across the globe. So I would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. We will know whether that is share gains when we are able to actually look at that in the rearview mirror. But there is still plenty of competition out there. And so we are just focused on serving our clients the right way. But it does feel a little bit like we are doing well. Mike Mayo : And I know you were asked already about Brexit. Maybe if we can hear from you, Jamie, about the implications of Brexit? Marianne, you said, \"minimize friction cost\", if you can just give us some sense of what that means? You have given us lot of guidance about the recent quarter and the year ahead, but you have what could be a monumental event and you haven't really talked to investors about that since Brexit's occurred. So how do you think about currency risk, the cost, the revenues and are you delaying any investments, given the increased uncertainty? Jamie Dimon : Yes. I am going to try to tell you as best as I can, if you can hear me. So number one, we do think it will reduce the GDP of the U.K. and the EU a little bit. Obviously, that's not going to affect our business plans. That will affect the economies a little bit. Number two, we know that it is going to create uncertainty for an extended time period. So we don't think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know, because there a lot of parties involved. We are hoping that political leaders are very sensible. It makes sense for both the EU and for Britain to think through the process to make it sensible whatever changes they make in order to give businesses time, I am talking about years, time to adjust to the new reality which we don't know what it is. I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients, day in and day out and if it costs a little bit extra, so be it. I am not really worried about it. I wish it would be nice if it doesn't create a huge turmoil. So I am hoping the EU is sensible. But we are going to be prepared. As Marianne mentioned, there is a range of outcomes and anyone in our shoes will try to be prepared for each one of them, but we are not going to pull back on serving people in Italy, Germany, France, U.K. or Spain, because it might lead to higher cost. I would accept the higher cost as opposed to disrupt our clients. Marianne Lake : And I would also want to point out, Mike, that competitively we are not in this situation alone and so we are going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. And obviously we will update you as and when that becomes clearer. But we are not going to at a competitive disadvantage, if anything, as we talked about earlier. We feel like we are in a position of strength. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just, first off, had a follow-up on Brexit. Post this development, have you seen any impact on your banking pipelines? Has this had any impact on appetite for M&A, particularly if there is a component that involves either the continent or the U.K.? Marianne Lake : So the truth of the matter is, it's a very early phase and I hate to continue to repeat that, but I will tell you that generally speaking uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for M&A. But in this case I think there are some offsets. So I would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with CEOs and at the Board, cross border, it is as good as it's ever been. And if you think about just the other factors that would be supportive of M&A, so like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the U.S. and globally notwithstanding a bit of the steam taken out in Europe or the U.K., all of that should continue to be supportive for strategic M&A. Yes. So at the end of the day and currency could be supportive at cross-border activity. So there are puts and takes, uncertain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. But at the end of day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases and similarly volatility generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM but investor appetite is still there and there have been deals price prospects. So it's a little early, the selectivity. Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point and I think because there are no event calendars out there right now, there is still quite a lot of opportunity in the, sorry, obviously DCM low rates would be a tailwind notwithstanding the M&A in ECM landscape. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that. And then one more on credit here. So it seems that we have 30-day delinquency rate actually go quarter-over-quarter. So it seems like maybe in the card business, so it seems like maybe a secure rate issue. Is that the right assumption? And then could you give maybe a little color on how much the non-prime growth has driven in recent in recent vintages versus prior? Marianne Lake : So let me start with the second part of the question. So we are still very much contemplated in the prime and near-prime space, but we have a higher percentage of our originations in the near-prime space, reasonably meaningfully higher over the course of last couple of years. So where we may have previously been, I think 40% above, 760 now, that's less than that and there's more like 20% or 30% below 700, but at the end of the day, still pristine credit relatively speaking. With respect to the delinquencies, is it accrual rate issues, not specifically, no. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi Marianne. I am not sure if this is to early, but when you think about expenses longer term beyond this year, if you think about 2017, if we find ourselves in a similar revenue environment next year, when you wrap in your cost save objectives and where you want to be on investment spend, do you think you will be shooting for expenses to be in the same range of that $56 million next year, if things don't change on the revenue front? Marianne Lake : So look, we are not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers and I think we are at a very good run rate of investments. We have increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars in auto lease growth and that will drive probability in the medium to longer term. So it's possible if we see opportunity to continue to do that we would do it. But we have no specific guidance yet. John McDonald : Okay. Marianne Lake : The revenue environment can change reasonably quickly, particularly as you know with rates and to a lesser degree, market. So we are not going to overreact to short term. John McDonald : Sure. Just more near-term. You talked at a recent conference about the tax rate going forward. Just with the issues you had this quarter with the tax rate looking at 39%, you said it would be 36%. What should we think about going forward? Is it in that 36%? Marianne Lake : Yes. Taxes, most likely, generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic. Outside of those yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Marianne, I had a question on the outlook. You reaffirmed the fee income from guidance of $50 billion plus or minus for the full year. And I am trying to gauge, just given the tough start to the year in trading in 1Q, the subdued second half M&A commentary and second half trading seasonality that we would typically expect, the $50 billion target does appear somewhat ambitious. And I don't know if you felt like that was a fair assessment or just given what you are seeing across the businesses that the $50 billion is still relatively achievable? Marianne Lake : So starting with the qualification that obviously as you suggested, it's going to the market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower. So here is what I would say, first half market was challenged, second half the market was better. Net net -- sorry, first quarter market was challenged, second quarter better. Net net, first half relatively flat year-over-year. So call it with the acknowledgment that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the second half of the year, mortgage better. So you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year-on-year actually by a reasonably significant amount given obviously where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your point lower IB fees and lower asset management revenues, given the environment. So the way I would characterize it is, there are puts and takes, but net net it's still at reasonable central case. So we are not changing it. But it's market dependent. Steven Chubak : Thanks Marianne. And just one more for me on CCAR. Just given that you have had some time to digest the latest set of results, the improvement in PPNR was probably the most impressive aspect of the release, at least based on our findings. But from what you could gather based on your own internal assessment, what were the primary drivers of the increase where maybe we have some limited visibility such as areas like op-risk? And does a favorable CCAR outcome inform your view in terms of which constraint is currently most binding and maybe how you might change your deployment across the different businesses? Marianne Lake : Okay. So look, I would say, if you look at the last three years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's were low, not to say that that means that these results are more normal. But I would say, if you look at the three years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the portfolio risks the revenue generation we would expect and you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. So I don't have insights that I can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year-on-year nor do we really try to do that. You are right, operational risk is likely a piece of it and that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say, there can be volatility, but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think that the PPNR would start and it's consistent. as you can see relatively speaking with what we calculated. In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does means is if you look at the analysis that we have done a couple of years in the a row now where we have said using that the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply, our CET1 ratio would need to be to pass. It had previously being a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and therefore the improved results at this point it would be a little less than 10%. So in that context as we look forward sometime in the near future maybe in the third quarter to getting 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully it will alleviate to a degree, a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest you, as we said in Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding. It's not likely, it will become binding and so we will continue to take that into consideration as we go forward and we are already taking into consideration as we think about optimizing against the most binding constraints we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. Yes, thanks. So a quick question on the mortgage originations. The correspondent channel didn't change all that much quarter-on-quarter, although it was with seasonality and a pickup in refis that would have increased in the second quarter. Can you talk about how you are thinking about correspondent mortgage origination? And given that refi volume looks strong at the start of the third quarter, should we expect a pickup in the correspondent in the third quarter? Marianne Lake : So we think about using all of our channels based upon obviously, the demand and our capacity and our appetite as we want to continue to close strongly for our customers and we have obviously also been focused in the anticipation of it becoming a more purchase oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail distribution channel and that's been very successful. So there is less correspondent contribution this quarter. It is a lever we will likely use going forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is it the right way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank of your size? Is it 1% of revenues is kind of an ongoing run rate for expected legal expenses going forward? Or is that not the right way to think about it and it's just episodic? Marianne Lake : Well, at this point, we would still say, it will be episodic. And while we are hopeful that the overall structural cost will start coming down or it has come down and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some puts and takes in the legal space. There is no real way, obviously, of forecasting the run rate. I would just do what many of you have done, I think and go back and look at what the legal expense look like in the years preceding the crisis and make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher, but it probably wouldn't be multiples of that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Marianne Lake : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering just if you could, I know it's a little backward looking now and you have made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be, but can you help us understand the products that drove the really strong fixed trading? And what happened in June? Was it volumes? Was it spreads widening? And then I would actually ask what you typically consider what normal JPMorgan seasonality is, as you mentioned? Marianne Lake : Okay. So it was particularly strong rates but nevertheless also a very strong year-over-year in currencies, emerging markets, credit trading SPG. So I mean it was pretty broad based, but remember you also have to think about it relative to the equivalent quarter last year and we didn't have a particularly strong second quarter last year. So on a relative basis that is an important factor but it was pretty broad based. More volume than anything. And then seasonality, I am sorry. Look, it's anyone's guess and I think you can go back and look over time, but last year we had a weak second quarter, as I said and we didn't see as much seasonality. But if you look at the last quarter's run rate, I don't know if that would be a bad place to start. Last year's third quarter run rate would not be a bad place to start. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay. And the second question just is, on the wholesale reserve, you mentioned, it's been nice to see the energy prices start to stabilize and it seems like you are able to stabilize the amount of reserve build outstanding aside from that one credit. What needs to happen for you to get even more comfortable or you could see some of that reserve start to come out, underneath the context of that you are also growing the wholesale business extremely fast as well. So? Marianne Lake : So I am going to start off with a couple of general comments which is, we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we have experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we are at the point now where at least as a basic matter, as we are experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we are in a reasonably good reserve our position notwithstanding that idiosyncratic there may be additional adds. What we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to prepare their balance sheet and continued stabilization, if not improvement in oil and gas prices. And so, everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. And yes, we are growing our portfolio and so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves. But there are also time to pay down lots of other puts and takes too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Marianne Lake : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Marianne. Thank you. Marianne, can you give us some color. Obviously your consumer loan growth has picked up quite nicely. You pointed to, it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year. What are your guys seeing on consumer behavior? Has it improved and they feel stronger about their own job prospects which is enabling them to borrow more? Are there any metrics that you guys are looking at from that end? Marianne Lake : So I mean, just to say, we obviously have own spend data to look at and it continues, the card spend is up 8% year-on-year, energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers, the labor market continues to be solid and improving and sentiment is still good, housing still improving. So I mean, really just looking at the same things you are looking at and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it, but all other things equal, consumers are in very good shape and demand is there for the products. And we have been investing outside of consumer in new products -- inside consumers, sorry in the Freedom Unlimited space and also in marketing. So we are growing not only because the demand is there but also through investing. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And then coming back to credit, obviously your first quarter results had the results of the targeted Shared National Credit exam for oil. Traditionally obviously we have the Shared National Credit exam every year and second quarter results normally reflect that exam. Do your second quarter results reflect the Shared National Credit exam? Marianne Lake : Our second quarter result reflects everything that we have and we know of at the end of the quarter and we are not going to make any specific comments on regulatory events. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks. Marianne, just a couple of quick follow-ups on the auto lending business. The originations came down a bit and you talked about the dynamics around that previously in the quarter and at the Investor Day. But when I polled auto lender or auto dealers, they say that where they had primarily seen you retreat was from very high FICO, super prime new lending and leasing but their experience with Chase remained very consistent in the mid-FICO range. I just wanted to see if that was consistent with your view internally? Marianne Lake : More specifically, I am not sure. I haven't polled the dealers myself, but we continue to have very high FICO scores and no, I am not aware of that. But I can't comment. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And then just one follow-up on one auto credit. Obviously the Manheim issue points to perhaps some rising severity given default. But at this stage, is there anything that suggest to you that we should see a higher frequency of default? Marianne Lake : In our portfolio at this point, no. Operator : Okay. And your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Paul Miller : Yes. Thank you very much. One of the things about what we saw was mortgage rates, the tenure dropping down to record levels and mortgage rates probably following right behind it. Can you give us a little outlook? Are you seeing an uptick in refis? We are seeing the refi nexus go up very high and any outlook on where you think the mortgage market is going to be in the next quarter or two? Marianne Lake : Yes. So we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters and the mortgage market as best we can tell will be at around $1.7 trillion to$1.8 trillion this year. Paul Miller : And the other follow-up question is, there are some news articles out there about JPMorgan securitizing conforming loans. This hasn't really been done a lot by anybody. I don't know if you can address that, the economics behind that or what's the thought behind that instead of getting Fannie and Freddie wraps to securitizing yourself? Marianne Lake : Yes. So we have done one and we are looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space and we are keeping a vertical stride where retaining the loans on our balance sheet or the securities on our balance sheet, I should say and in doing that we have been able to that private capital to take majority of the lower credit risk and get better capital treatment for ourselves. Yes, so in terms of the RWA that it attracts. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Most of my questions have actually been answered, but just a quick follow-up on the credit card originations in terms of dipping down to the lower prime or below. You said something like 20% to 30% had FICO scores below 700 and I didn't know if that was for new originations or for the portfolio overall that you were referring to? Marianne Lake : New originations. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the focus everybody has on the flattening of the treasury curve. But yet earlier you were able to say that going into the next year, you would see 2016 NII growth of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, only really fall to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which means that that flattening of the yield curve is very manageable. Just talk about asset yields as your earning asset yield actually went up one basis point, what you have been able to see in the market versus what's happening in the treasury curve? Marianne Lake : So I will just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us and if you look at our balance sheet and you look at we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either IOER or in LIBOR loans, it's about $650 billion and so we are much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve. And if you look at our earnings at risk disclosures, 100 basis point parallel shift would be around $800 million. And so, obviously we haven't seen and won't hopefully see anything of that order of magnitude. So that kind of gives you an ability to size up notwithstanding compounding why you have only seen our NII relative to prior expectations come down by that much. Marty Mosby : In this particular quarter, your funding cost went up, is that a lag effect from the rate hike in December still just now coming through or was there something else maybe more unusual about funding cost that we saw that drove the margin down this particular quarter? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I think earlier on the call, somebody else asked the question and I made the comment that it's really more related to the results from our hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. And so in the first quarter, dollar weakened and in the second quarter it strengthened and we had some currency basis in the first quarter that we didn't see in the second quarter. It really is, not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting nothing really else than that. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Marianne Lake : Hi there, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi again. Just a follow up on the card new originations. I know one of the key things that you have done for many years is to focus on relationship, lending relationship offerings. And so when I hear the 20% of the new originations are below FICO 700, is that a shift from the relationship strategy that you have? Or does it reflect the fact that you do have significant relationships on deposits, et cetera with folks in that FICO band? Marianne Lake : Yes. No shift from our desire to want to be in with engaged customers and our rewards programs. Our products are all geared towards that. So it's really just a credit decision. And yes, we do have relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Marianne Lake : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Hi. Thank you. As a follow-up, Marianne, your consumer business obviously has been very, very strong. Can you share with us the update on clearXchange expected to be rolled out to be later this year and what that might do to even grow the mobile business even more than it\u2019s growing now? Marianne Lake : Yes. So look, obviously B2B real-time payments is very important to our customers. So therefore, it is important to us. It is also important for us as an in the industry that it's done in a safe and secure way. And so early warning, the fraud protection that they are able to provide as well as bank levels cyber security and the absence of the need to provide your bank credentials, we think is very strongly positive for our customers and we expect to see volumes grow across that. As you know we have QuickPay already and we saw reasonably significantly volumes, $21 billion on QuickPay last year and growing So, I would expect to see more and more P2P payments and it's good for our customers, it's good for us. Jamie Dimon : So if you look at the whole payment space, Chase Paymentech has gained share, ChaseNet is doing very well, Chase Pay, we have signed up lots of different people and one piece of that is P2P. So today right now, if you use Chase QuickPay, it is very easy within Chase to Chase, it is just now as easy to open Chase to a bunch of other banks. I won't name now, but we just started rolling out and soon it will be rolled out to 60% of American banking accounts and then we are going to make it available to all banks. So you will be able to go P2P real-time through Chase QuickPay. There will be a special app for Chase QuickPay, but it will also be branded on other names which we haven't rolled out yet, which I think will be rolled out shortly. So I think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this and it would be a great service which I think shows you the bank is making progress and you would have called prior fintech. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you for the color. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thank you everyone. Thank you operator. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you again for joining us today. This does concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be mute for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one and taking a look at the quarter, we had strong performance in each of our businesses despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions. And bringing it altogether, this quarter\u2019s result was clean with no significant items and with the Firm reporting net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of a $1.58, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.5 billion of revenue. Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for third quarter in the CIB with IB fees up 15% and markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board, robust core loan growth for the Company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses, and the continuation of strong credit performance including a net release for oil and gas. Card sales are back to double-digit growth year-on-year and we saw a strong positive market reaction to new proprietary products. And finally, we had record consumer deposit growth up 11%. Before I move on, we recently submitted our 2016 resolution filing. The Board and management believe that we submitted a credible plan and more than met the requirement for the October submission. It was a tremendous effort across the Company involving all businesses and functions, and we took many significant actions, perhaps most notably improving the Firm\u2019s overall liquidity and prepositioning our material legal entities for both liquidity and capital. We determined this is in the best interest of the Company, albeit at some cost. And we took many other important actions which hopefully you\u2019ve had a chance to review in our public filings. Moving back to the quarter, moving on to page two, revenue of $25.5 billion was up $2 billion year-on-year or up 8%. On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter. Non-interest revenue was up $1.3 billion driven by strong performance in the CIB. Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in consumer, which I\u2019ll talk about later, as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense. Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve build of $225 million, primarily card, but against that we have a net reserve release in wholesale for oil and gas of about $50 million. So, as I said, net income was $6.3 billion and while down 8% year-on-year, you will recall that there were a number of significant items in last year\u2019s results, most notably significant tax benefit. If you adjust for tax, legal expenses and credit reserves, net income is up over $800 million year-on-year. Dealing with oil and gas here, we\u2019re encouraged by how quickly investor sentiment and risk appetite for the sector returned as the outlook for both oil and gas prices continued to improve. Capital market opened more broadly to these clients and we experienced lower draws against our facilities than previously anticipated. So, a combination of pay downs opportunistic loan sales and select upgrades more than offset the impact of downgrades. If the environment remains broadly consistent with today, we would not expect further significant builds in the fourth quarter for energy. Moving to page three and capital, key takeaways from this page, capital and leverage ratios were broadly flat quarter-on-quarter with the CET1 ratio of 11.9%, as net capital generation was offset by strong loan and commitment growth. Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth, as well as liability action taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets. While HQLA was up $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, our liquid assets were up significantly more than that. As I said liquidity at the bank is not included in reported HQLA. Finally, we returned $3.8 billion of net capital to shareholders including $2.1 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Moving onto page four and consumer and community banking. Consumer and community banking generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16%. We continued to experience record deposit growth more than twice the industry average, up 11% year-on-year. More than half of that growth is from existing customers. And based on the FDIC survey for 2016, we were number one in absolute growth and grew share in each of our top 30 markets. Core loan growth remained strong at 19%. And while it\u2019s primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in business banking and 7% in card loans. Card new account originations were up 35% with strong demand for Sapphire Reserve and Freedom Unlimited and with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels. Card sales volume was up double-digit this quarter and we expect share gains to accelerate. So to close on drivers, we saw merchant processing volumes up 13% and our active mobile customer base up 17%. Revenue of $11.3 billion was up 4% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was also up 4% on the back of strong deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high quality loans to our portfolio. Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 1% as a strong momentum in card and auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination cost and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations. And while the new account origination costs do cause a near-term drag on revenues, it\u2019s a high cost problem to have as we expect these accounts will be strongly accretive over time. Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs but it will clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated. Expense of $6.5 billion is up year-on-year, as I said, driven by two notable items, totaling a $175 million as well as the increased FDIC surcharge. The first item relates to liabilities assumed for a merchant in bankruptcy and the second is a modest increase in reserve for mortgage servicing. Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth which is in line with investor day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency. Finally, the credit environment remains favorable. In cards, we built $200 million of reserve this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio including newer vintages which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans. And in auto, we built $25 million of reserves on the back of high quality loan growth. Now, turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. Total revenues of CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IB fees on record for third quarter too, up 15% with strong market performance across the board, revenues up 33%. Expense was down 20% year-on-year on lower legal costs but also with strong expense discipline more broadly. Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for oil and gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter. Diving deeper, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-over-year with strong performance across products. We ranked number one in Global IB fees maintaining share on a year-to-date basis, and ranked number one in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were up 8% year-over-year and we continued to rank number two globally and have done more deals than anyone else so far this year. In equity underwriting, fees were 38% year-on-year. With the stable market backdrop and strong investor demand, issuance was up across products and particularly in IPOs. We ranked number one in wallet globally and in North America and EMEA and we also ranked number one on a number of deals basis for overall ECM and IPOs. Debt underwriting had the highest third quarter on record with strong market-wide bond issuance, record high grade bond supply in August and yields near record lows. Fees were 12% from a high watermark last year and we ranked number one. In terms of outlook, given the strength this quarter, we expect IB fees to be down in the fourth quarter sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year. Markets revenue of $5.7 billion was up 33% year-on-year. Clients were active and risk management conditions were favorable. Fixed income revenue was up 48% compared to a weaker third quarter last year. Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post Brexit with good client flow, as well as anticipation of an uncertainty around central bank actions. Currencies in emerging markets matched a very strong third quarter last year but was slowed down slightly. And credit and securitized products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market making and new issuance environment resulting in a particularly strong quarter. Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last year\u2019s strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volume. Taking treasury services and security services revenues together, each were over $900 million with strong forward pipelines and levers to higher rates. Moving on to page six and commercial banking. Commercial banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, driven by a trifecta of NII on loan growth, higher deposit spreads, as well as higher IB revenues. Loan growth continues to be strong across both C&I and CRE, outperforming the industry. C&I loans were up 10% year-on-year, despite competition for quality loans as the investments that we\u2019ve been making this year are delivering results. We\u2019ve added over a 100 net new bankers, opened seven new offices and further built out our specialized industry coverage. And we\u2019ve added nearly 600 new relationships in middle market this year. CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. We\u2019re also seeing stable to improving new loan spreads. IB revenue was up 57%, in part driven by a few large transactions but bringing year-to-date IB revenues closer to flat versus last year, which is a strong performance. Expense growth of 4% is driven by our investments. And as I said, these investments are already paying off. Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by oil and gas. In addition, you see further reserve releases for oil and gas here as I mentioned earlier. Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter. Leaving the commercial bank and moving on to asset management on page seven. Asset management reported net income of $557 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads. Expense to $2.1 billion was up slightly year-on-year and up 2% sequentially on higher incentive compensation. We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi assets including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter, as well as inflows and alternatives in fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products. In addition, we were the beneficiary of the $22 billion of liquidity flow this quarter, capturing more than our share of many in motion given money market reform. AUM grew 4% and overall client assets 5% to $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion respectively driven by market as well as long-term flows. Our long-term investment performance remained solid with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $114 billion, up 5% year-on-year, driven by mortgage. Skipping over page eight and corporate where the results were very close to home and where there are no significant items to highlight, so turning to page nine and the outlook. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth, even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution based liquidity actions, which will be pulling in our run rate in the fourth quarter. Expect non-interest revenues to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IB fees and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages. All else equal, expect NII to come in at $50.5 billion plus or minus for the full year, market dependent. Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion consistent with our guidance and self funding the consumer items I mentioned. So to wrap up, strong performance whichever you look at to this quarter. We\u2019re continuing to demonstrate that our operating models and our platform is working for our clients, that our scale across businesses gives us operating leverage and that our investments through time are paying off. And while as a Company, we are proud of this quarter\u2019s performance and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance. With that, operator, please open up the line and we can take questions. Operator : [Audio Gap] from CLSA. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you talk about the competitive environment in capital markets? I mean, you had a strong growth. Is that due to better markets, better share or both? Marianne Lake : So, I think there is three things -- three or four things to mention. The first is that I would say that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. And so, when you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are little flattered by last year\u2019s performance, not necessarily more so than our peers but nevertheless we are. And then, we talked about the fact that this quarter the conditions were relatively favorable broadly and compare and contrast that last year where there were pockets of activity in client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. So, I think client flow quite broadly across the environment would characterize the quarter. In terms of the competitive performance, I would say it feels like we did well. Obviously we\u2019re the first to report, apart from Citi this morning. It feels like we did relatively well. So, we may have gained some share, certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business we\u2019ve been building in the way we are serving our clients, will serve us in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time. But obviously that can be a bit of volatility in the market share space. So, we prefer to look at it more through time and we feel pretty good about the performance. Mike Mayo : Specifically versus the European banks, so are you looking to use your balance sheet more to gain share? Marianne Lake : So, I would say, we don\u2019t specifically target a competitive set to -- but, I will tell you that our balance sheet, we talked about it many times on this call before, that we do have the capacity to put our balance sheet and our resources to work for our clients, for our best clients and we think about using those resources in the context of overall relationship. So, if any peer is more leverage constrained and has less access, we may have competitive advantage. And certainly, we will continue to make those resources available to our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Marianne Lake : Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I\u2019m curious on card delinquencies picking up. I know you\u2019ve been guiding towards that but when you see, it is the only part of credit that has anything but great trends. You mentioned on your comments newer vintages will have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average. Do you mind just drilling down a little bit more color on what exactly is driving that; is that going down credit a little bit or is that just expected season, as you thought? Marianne Lake : So, I don\u2019t know Glenn if you recall, we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and sort of guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, I mean partly because obviously 250ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically. But also because over the course of the last couple of years, we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near prime space and still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. So, we\u2019re getting paid for that. So, we are doing it within our risk appetite doing it judiciously. But as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population, they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. So, what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-off gradual increases completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. And so, as you look forward for us over the course for the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue again slowly, we\u2019re growing our portfolio, we\u2019re going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build a reserve but for the right reason. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. Just one follow-up if I could get a just a high level comment on has anything materially changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as you\u2019re getting all this great loan growth? I\u2019m just curious on current positioning. Marianne Lake : No, nothing significant, Glenn. No significant changes to our sensitivity. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a question on the Card strategy. And I know -- we all know that you\u2019ve created the closed loop and you\u2019re using that in part, it seems to drive really efficient pricing in the marketplace on the credit card products. What I am obviously seeing is an increase in share on card issuance; you\u2019re taking some nice share in the merchant space as well. I just want to understand what the goal is and how far you\u2019re willing to push this market share versus ROA, ROE. Marianne Lake : So, I would say that all of the things that you mentioned whether it\u2019s closed loop network, whether it\u2019s our new proprietary products whether it\u2019s our investments in the technology platform and the business merchant services are all at good returns that ultimately will drive the business to be profitable in the future as it has been in the past. So, we haven\u2019t given specific guidance for ROE part of this business but nothing has changed over the medium term for what we think that the performance of the business would be. Betsy Graseck : So, is it fair to suggest that part of the market share improvement here is coming from some give-up of profitability? And the underlying question is really how much market share do you want in this business? You are already at 18% to 22% market share of the credit card space, depending on which numbers you want to use. Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a very competitive business and it\u2019s very profitable. So, all other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Marianne, just wondering, you mentioned that part of the increase in consumer cost this quarter was planned investments and that you\u2019re continuing to self fund. I am just wondering as you think forward and we get past this good gear that you\u2019ve had, will that be kind of underlying expectation for you guys, again with the understanding that the revenue environment will always take things up or down; but do you have an aspiration that you can continue to keep costs flat? Marianne Lake : So, I mean, look, we haven\u2019t given specific cost guidance going out beyond this year at this point. But our objective will remain consistent with those that we stated previously, which is we continue to try and become more efficient across our businesses. As you know, we\u2019re at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense programs in our largest businesses, so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly whether that\u2019s in products and marketing and investment in innovation all of which we\u2019re doing as much as we can as long as we do it well. And so, it\u2019s going to come down to if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an appropriate return, we would like to keep doing that. And in order to have the right to do it, we would like to become more and more efficient in our core business operations. So, we haven\u2019t actually given guidance, I think I would characterize it as expenses under control, creating capacity to invest but we will decision investment based upon their merits and obviously explain them to you in the future at Investor Day if not on other venues. Ken Usdin : And if I can come back to another investment day point from earlier this year, you\u2019d mentioned that you\u2019d felt comfortable with an 11% CET1; you plan to get to your CET1 to 12%; you are at 12.1% now already. Just within the construct of Governor Tarullo\u2019s recent commentary, does 11% still feel like the right time; did you sense anything from the commentary that would change your philosophy around where you\u2019d like to live in that potential comment you made at February to potentially go above 100, if in fact this was the right mechanism? Marianne Lake : So, first of all, I would say that based upon the speech, and obviously you know that there are still some unanswered questions with respect to specific parts of the proposal, which I\u2019ll come back to. But based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy and using the capital stack add-up using our G-SIB Score and our stress drawdown, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint on the CCAR that\u2019s pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. So in that sense, because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of RWA growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we\u2019ve actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year\u2019s test by both of those two measures, which is a place we played in for a while. We\u2019ve been -- as we talked about before, we\u2019ve been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to sort of operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. And I think we think we don\u2019t know obviously how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. And in any case, this is not for the 2017 CCAR cycle. So, it\u2019s a whole cycle away from now. And we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct that we have previously. And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above top end of our range. Meanwhile we are at the top end of our range now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a quick follow-up on FICC in your commentary and maybe a broader -- maybe you can have a broader commentary around how the widening LIBOR or rising LIBOR yields helped your businesses across the board in FICC or anywhere else. Just help us understand how that\u2019s playing through the income statement. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I\u2019ll just -- generally speaking with respect to our rate sensitivity, as I think you know we are most sensitive to the front end of the curve but to IOER and prime. So, we do have LIBOR based assets but also liabilities. Good examples would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side but our notational mismatch is not particularly big. And so, as a consequence, impact of LIBOR curve move has been not very significant on our P&L, we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be. I will say that the LIBOR moves were one of the features that our rate business had a perspective around and they got good client flow in and around that trade. And so, it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts that we point to in terms of ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that condition. But I wouldn\u2019t put a number on it for you. Jim Mitchell : And maybe just a follow-up on deposits; you guys have had very good trends in retail. But on the institutional side, there was quite a bit of flow, looked like as well. Any particular drivers there; was it money market reform helping the flows in institutional or something else? Marianne Lake : We obviously did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government funds but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits. And so, as I look at our overall strong deposit growth, I wouldn\u2019t say it was equally but it was pretty much equally wholesale operating and retail deposit growth. So, we feel good about both of those. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: In light of some of the selling issues over at Wells Fargo, I was just wondering if you\u2019ve thought about reevaluating how you approach the consumer, how you compensate staff; and this was obviously not a JPMorgan specific question, but just for the overall industry I think it\u2019s something that folks are wondering about. There is clearly some stuff that\u2019s black and white that you shouldn\u2019t do but I think we also worry that there might be some gray areas that are somewhat less known. So, just how are you thinking about the way you conduct business and compensate staff in light of what\u2019s going on? Marianne Lake : So, I might just give for context, remind you or maybe you recall that for a number of years now for a fairly long time,, we\u2019ve been standing up at Investor Day and other venue saying that customer experience is the central tenant for how we think about engaging with all of our clients but certainly our retail clients in the branches. And we\u2019ve been very, very focused on investing in customer experience broadly defined and have made great progress I think in doing that. And also we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep customer relationship engaged customers who want to be primary bank, we want to gather a deeper share of wallet, so balances not necessarily products. And so again, remember saying cross-sell is an outcome, it\u2019s not an objective. And that\u2019s certainly the philosophy with which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. And we review them regularly, at least annually to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and again objectives about the engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience in the right product, all the right reasons the right way. And so, as we think about those objectives and how we\u2019ve designed our plan and as we look inward not just and obviously because of the news now but also regularly in our BAU capacity, we feel like our plans are designed to incent those behaviors. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Just a question on back to CIB, you had a slide during Investor Day that showed a walk to $19 billion of expenses by 2017. If some of the factors that you mentioned that drove revenues into CIB higher repeat for 2017; is that $19 billion number still achievable or I guess a better way to ask it, will any incremental revenue uplift from here fall to the bottom-line? Marianne Lake : So, obviously, first of all, I would say we are on -- I\u2019ll tell you, we are on track with respect to the commitments that Daniel made to you to deliver over time the $2.8 billion of expense saves. While we are not finished yet, we are substantially through that program. So, it\u2019s moved from being a plan through execution to being in the later stages of execution. So, we feel very good about that which means that all other things equal that $19 billion is still a reasonable level of expense target. However, obviously we pay for performance. And so, clearly, if we have significant outperformance next year relative to our expectations at the time of setting those plans, there would be some variable costs associated with it. But for every dollar of outperformance, the variable cost may not always be the same. Obviously, it also depends upon the mix and the payout ratios and all those sorts of things. But a large, large portion of it would be -- it would be obviously as you know incredibly accretive because we will be leveraging all of our scale. So, the only variable cost would really be comped largely. Erika Najarian : And just as a follow-up to that -- a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question actually. He mentioned the stress capital buffer. Outside of the static balance sheet and capital distribution offset, is there an element to this in terms of just getting better at the test that you could do to reduce that stress capital buffer without actually taking risk down significantly? Marianne Lake : So, first of all, based upon last year\u2019s results for us, we are at the flow for the stress floor for the stress capital buffer, not to suggest by the way that we wouldn\u2019t continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can on the stress within our risk appetite. So, we are at that floor right now. So, within those home strengths, what we\u2019re trying to be, within our risk appetite manage risk properly, but also add shareholder value. We have to carry that capital anyway. So, we would want to use it, but use well. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR. Tim Hayes : Hi. This is Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. Can you give any color on your outlook for margin throughout 2017? To me, fed commentary suggests that rates could remain low and potentially hover around these levels over the next 12 months. So, how can we think about your NIM in that type of scenario? And then, what would a December rate hike do for your outlook? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, for your purposes, I\u2019m going to talk about NII; we don\u2019t really manage to NIM, but you can obviously back into it. So, if we ended up in a situation right now where rates are flat throughout all of 2017 which for what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think is pretty much anyone\u2019s central expectations right now. But if we were rate flat, you\u2019ve seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. And while we may not be able to replicate $0.15 core loan growth forever, certainly we can continue to grow our loans. So on that stuff, mix shift away from securities over time, we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental NII next year rate flat. You know that if rates are -- if we\u2019re fortunate enough for the right reasons that we see a hike this year, at the end of this year and get the full benefit of that next year it will be higher than that. And you\u2019ve seen our earnings and risk disclosures; they\u2019ve been pretty close to $3 billion number on a 100 basis-point move for a while most of which is front end. Tim Hayes : Okay, thank you. And then switching gears, your CRE and C&I lending was pretty strong this quarter. And regulators have obviously grown a little bit more cautious on those segments. So, just kind of if you could give any color for your outlook on lending to those segments going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, we\u2019re aware obviously of the riskier types of CRE lending, the types of lending that attract scrutiny and for reasonable reasons considering how they performed in past cycles. We are also mindful of where we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. So, we have and continue to avoid and what I would characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles. So, we really stick to our knitting if that\u2019s an American expression, in terms of continuing to do what we\u2019re good at within our risk appetite. And so, if you think about our commercial real estate growth, commercial term lending is about three quarters of our portfolio. And you know that we\u2019re very focused on smaller loan size, Class B, Class C properties with low vacancy rate. So, rent stabilized, supply constraint markets, underwrite to LTVs, good debt service coverage, we look at forward rates and current rents. And so, we really have expertise in a specific niche and we compete on speed and certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. So, we feel pretty good about our exposures and even in the more traditional real estate banking space and we have avoided riskier segments with limited construction lending exposure, home builders, minimal exposure; we\u2019re pretty disciplined about it. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Marianne, at a conference just before the end of the quarter, another bank talked about improving underwriting conditions in the auto lending space, particularly sort of in the mid to lower FICO range. Are you seeing anything similar? Marianne Lake : So, we are a primarily prime lender in auto. We are the number one prime lender. We actually have the lowest share in sub-prime among the national banks. So, it\u2019s less than 5% of our origination. So, I wouldn\u2019t speak specifically to underwriting in the lower FICO sectors, not where we play at this point. Eric Wasserstrom : Sure. I think the reference was to below 700, which includes the bottom end of the prime segment, which has been an area of intense competitive focus; I am just wondering if you\u2019ve seen anything in that segment. Marianne Lake : So, not that I would comment on except for we have recently decided to pull back on 84 months plus term loans on all FICO bands just as where we are in the cycle as we see the risks of that type of lending. So, we continue to calibrate our underwriting but I wouldn\u2019t comment on seeing anything specifically. Eric Wasserstrom : And is that influencing your reserve expectations for consumer at all? Marianne Lake : Auto? Eric Wasserstrom : Yes. Marianne Lake : We\u2019ve built $25 million of reserve this quarter for auto and we expect to continue. We think that auto opportunity is still strong and we have a great franchise, we have great manufacturing partnerships that are growing strongly too. So, as we grow that portfolio, I would expect us to continue to grow reserves modestly in 2017. However, we are expecting charge-offs to stay under control. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak from Nomura. Steve Chubak : Marianne, I appreciated your remarks on the latest guidance from Tarullo relating to G-SIB capital. One of the questions we\u2019ve been getting from a lot of folks is because this SEB is calculated based on stress losses year-to-year and historically CCAR results have been pretty volatile, I am wondering how you are thinking about the appropriate management cushion or buffer above the minimum. Historically, it had been about 50 bps just for AOCI volatility and maybe operational risk losses. But, do you now have to also handicap CCAR volatility when thinking about that cushion? Marianne Lake : So, you\u2019re right and obviously even specifically for JPMorgan, if you look our stress results that [indiscernible] by the fed over the course of last three years has been reasonable volatility. And clearly it\u2019s not the case that we will expect it to be complete. And I would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as we\u2019ve seen historically as the test has as you know over time occasionally included new not insignificant features. And while that may continue to be the case, I would think that there\u2019d be a bit more stability. But, we haven\u2019t actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like. Steve Chubak : And one more question just thinking about capital management priorities. Given that the new proposal, as you noted, allows for curtailment of the buyback or termination of the buyback and then curtailment of the dividend halfway through the test, do these changes as well as the softening of the 30% dividend cap alter your thinking about how you prioritize buybacks versus dividends? Marianne Lake : Before I talk about the prioritization of capital distributions, I would just start by saying our capital management policies prior to this year\u2019s CCAR and these year\u2019s resolutions had us making those actions regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in a test. And obviously as part of the resolution planning, we have revised our policies to include more granular triggers. So, our policies do with some specificity run pretty granularly through time through a stress speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking even if they don\u2019t get reflected in the test. With respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividend has been lifted. Dividends are ultimately at still a cost of the baseline minimum standard. So, there will be possibly some natural constraint there. It hasn\u2019t changed at this point anyway, the Board\u2019s determination or management\u2019s determination about the order of priority we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividends. And I think even though there may be some natural constraints, I think it would be above 30. Operator : The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : I just had a question. You pointed out that about three quarters of your credit card acquisitions organic growth coming through mobile channels or digital channels I should say. Can that be moved over to other consumer products or is it just unique to credit cards that you are going to be able to generate that much growth through the digital channel? Marianne Lake : So, we are very focused across spectrum of our businesses on developing better digital capabilities to allow seamless engagement with customers and acquisition through digital channels. There are complexities associated with documentation and standards for know your customer and anti money laundering that we\u2019re continuing to work through but ultimately it should be achievable and we\u2019re working on it. So, we one of the things that we\u2019ve previously mentioned is that majority of our consumer accounts are opened in branches. One of the reasons among others why branches have been important to us as well as advice centers and we will continue to work on trying to see how far and how fast we can move people to be able to have a better digital experience opening accounts with us. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up, obviously third quarter results in investment banking were very strong, fourth quarter seasonally is weaker than third quarter as you pointed out. Are there any other reasons why you think the fourth quarter numbers may be weaker than the third quarter other than the traditional seasonality? Marianne Lake : I would just -- I\u2019d start by pointing out that about all of the businesses -- all of our businesses, not just the ones that I talked about at the high level, not just macro spread equity, but even if you go a level below that quite granular, all of our businesses did really quite well this quarter. So, not to overuse the phrase, firing on all cylinders but it really was pretty consistent. And normally you might see pockets of more strength or less strength. So, I think it would be hard to imagine replicating this kind of strength through time consistently. But the fourth quarter is seasonally low; we have no reason to expect that it would not be. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, I just wanted to follow up on FRTB and Basel IV and how you\u2019re thinking about the implications for JPM at this stage? Marianne Lake : So, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of really -- it\u2019s clearly news but as we think about all of the FRTB; we talked about before modest and manageable; nothing about that has changed for us, but obviously there are the advanced and standardized credit operational proposals out there. The most important thing that we yet to really -- and there are pluses and minuses in it and it\u2019s different for us and others maybe but the one thing that we haven\u2019t really heard about yet that is how it will all be calibrated. And calibration will be very important. So, we are expecting to hear over the course of the next short while, and maybe that will be delayed from just given some of the discussions and we\u2019ll update you when we hear a bit more about how it will going to come together. But right now, it\u2019s still little unclear. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Many thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I'll take you through the presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. So starting on page 1, we had a strong end to the year, with record net income for a fourth quarter of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.71, and return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.3 billion, reflecting strong performance broadly across our businesses in a more constructive environment. You'll see on the page, a tax benefit of $475 million included in the result in the CIB, as we were able to utilize certain deferred tax assets. The quarter would have still been a record without that benefit.  Highlights for the quarter included core loan growth of 12% with strength across businesses, continued double-digit consumer deposit growth, ending with deposits over $600 billion, and record card sales volume up 14% on continued strong momentum. In addition, markets revenue was the highest on record for a fourth quarter, up 24% year-on-year, and credit performance remains, strong with net reserve releases across both consumer and wholesale. Moving on to page 2, and some more detail about the fourth quarter. Revenue of $24.3 billion was up $600 million or 2% year-on-year, driven by net interest income on the back of continued strong loan growth, as well as the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue was flat year-on-year, with strength in markets offset by higher card new account acquisition costs.  Adjusted expense of $13.6 billion was flat year-on-year, and this quarter's results included nearly $200 million of after-tax legal expense. Credit costs of $860 million in the quarter included a net reserve release of a little over $400 million across consumer and wholesale. Energy remained stable, and we saw modest releases in both oil and gas and metals and mining.  Shifting to the full year on page 3. Another full year record net income of $24.7 billion, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $99 billion of revenue. And while net income was up 1%, our EPS of $6.19 was up more than that as we continued our disciplined capital return to shareholders. Revenue was up $2.5 billion, driven by NII, up $2.7 billion, on the back of loan growth and the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue remained flat year-on-year, reflecting strength in markets and funding card new account acquisitions, as well as lower asset management revenues. Adjusted expense for the year came in at $56 billion as expected, and our adjusted overhead ratio improved to 57%, as we continued to execute on and near the end of our strategic cost programs in CCB and CIB, as well as self-funding incremental investments in growth of nearly $1 billion year-on-year. In addition, legal expense for the year was a modest positive.  Credit costs for the year were $5.4 billion. Net charge-offs of $4.7 billion were in line with guidance, and included $270 million of charge-offs related to oil and gas and metals and mining. And we added $670 million of net reserves, reflecting builds in card and energy, largely offset by releases in mortgage. Finally, net capital distributions for the year were approximately $15 billion, up $4 billion or 37%, including dividends of $1.88 a share, up 9%.  Turning to page 4 and capital. We ended the year above 12% for both standardized and advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratios in line with our expectations. Net capital generation for the quarter were a positive, included a 16 basis point impact of higher rates on investment securities AOCI. The advanced ratio improved primarily due to lower account party and market risk, whereas standardized was up by less, reflecting the impact of high quality loan growth.  We've been disciplined managing our balance sheet, and our average balance sheet for the quarter was a little over $2.5 trillion, and $1.5 trillion of RWA. SLR was down slightly from the prior quarter at 6.5%, as our average balance sheet was higher this quarter, primarily driven by deposit.  Moving on to page 5, and consumer and community banking. Consumer and community banking generated $2.4 billion of net income, and an ROE of 17%. We grew deposits a record $60 billion year-over-year, up 11%, exceeding $600 billion.  Core loans were up 14%, with mortgage up over 20%, but strength across all products, also up 11%, business banking up 9%, and card up 8%. We saw record card sales volume in the quarter, up 14% marking the strongest growth in a decade. Card new account originations were up 8%. They were up 20% for the full year, driven by strong demand for new products, and nearly 80% of those accounts were opened through digital channels. Merchant processing volumes were up 10% year-on-year, and surpassed the $1 trillion mark last year. And our active mobile customer base continues to grow and was up 16%.  Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly year-on-year, reflecting a reduction in card revenue. Recall that last year included a $160 million gain on the Square IPO. And in addition, strong momentum in card and auto was more than offset by the investments in our card new account acquisitions. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 4% on strong deposit growth, and mortgage revenue was relatively flat as higher production margins and volumes were offset by lower servicing revenue on lower balances.  Expense of $6.3 billion was flat year-on-year, as growth in the business was largely offset by continued expense efficiencies and lower legal. Finally the credit trends in our portfolio remained favorable. We saw net reserve releases in the quarter driven by mortgage on lower delinquencies as well as improving HPI, with releases of $275 million in the PCI portfolio and $150 million in NCI.  On PCI specifically, actual losses have been lower than modeled output, and the release this quarter reflects that trend. We will continue to observe actuals, and recalibrate our models as necessary which may result in future releases. These releases in mortgage were partially offset by a build in card of $150 million, and $50 million in business banking, both on the back of strong loan growth. Charge-offs increased year-over-year driven by card, as newer vintages continue to season in line with our expectations. And in auto, we are watching industry trends in subprime and used car prices, but our heavily prime auto portfolio continues to perform well.  Now turning to page 6, and the corporate investment bank. CIB delivered a very strong result, with net income of $3.4 billion, and an ROE of 20%. Adjusting for legal, tax and credit costs, the ROE was a strong 17% for the quarter. Revenue of $8.5 billion, up 20% year-on-year was our best reported performance ever for a fourth quarter.  As we look at the full year, a moment on lead tables, in banking we ranked number one in global IB fees, and number one in North America and EMEA, and we were the only bank among the top 5 to grow share. In M&A, we continued to rank number two globally, and did more deals than anyone else last year. In ECM, we maintained our number one ranking, improved our share, and we're number one in volume across all products, and in both North America and Europe. And in DCM, we ranked number one across high yield, high grade and loans.  Back to the quarter, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year. Advisory fees were down 17% from a strong prior year quarter, and impacted by lower announced volumes in the first half of last year. Equity underwriting fees were down 5%, a little better than the market with strong performance in North America, and debt underwriting fees were up 32% relative to a weak prior year quarter, on strong flow issuance as well as acquisition financing. Treasury services revenue of $950 million was up 5%, driven by higher rates and operating balance growth, as well as higher fees on increased payment volumes.  Moving on to markets, another strong quarter with the highest revenue on record for a fourth quarter in total, and for each of fixed income and equities. And like last quarter, the strength was broad-based. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 24% year-on-year, in part flattered by a weaker fourth quarter last year, but on the whole driven by momentum carried forward from the third quarter, and the ability to capture flow from higher volatility and client activity. The back drop was that of a healthier global economic outlook, increased optimism, and global political developments. More specifically, fixed income revenue was up 31%, as we saw increased client risk appetite for spread product, as well as client's actively hedging commodities in a better energy market. And equities revenue was up 8% reflecting strong performance in derivatives. Credit costs were a benefit of nearly $200 million, primarily driven by oil and gas and metals and mining. And finally, expense of $4.2 billion was down 6% year-on-year, primarily on lower compensation resulting in a comp to revenue ratio of 27% for the full year.  Moving on to page 7, and commercial banking. Another outstanding quarter in commercial banking, with net income of $687 million, record revenue of $2 billion, and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 12% and expense down 1%, with an overhead ratio of 38%. Loan growth remains robust, credit performance remains strong, and client sentiment has improved.  Revenue growth was driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth, with loan spreads holding steady, as well as higher IB revenue with good underlying deal flow. For the full year, IB revenue was a record $2.3 billion, up 5% year-on-year as we gained share. Expense was down slightly, with the impact of impairment in the aircraft leasing business last year offset by investments we've made in bankers and technologies this year.  We ended the year with record loan balances of $189 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in both C&I and CRE. C&I loans were up 9%, as the investments we've made in specialized industry coverage, as well as adding over 130 net new bankers this year contributed to growth. And CRE loans were up 19%.  Finally credit performance remains strong, with a net charge-off rate of 11 basis points, driven by a couple of oil and gas names largely reserved for. And we saw a modest increase in loan loss reserves driven by some ex-client downgrades. In CRE, we had no net charge-offs, and we reiterate three quarters of this portfolio is multi-family lending, to own as a stabilized Class B and C properties in supply-constrained markets. And the remainder is real estate developers that we know well, and we continue to be disciplined, and limit exposures to riskier segments of the market.  Leaving the commercial bank, and moving on to asset management on page 8. Asset management reported net income of $586 million, with a 30% pre-tax margin and an ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher deposit NII and continued loan growth, predominantly offset by prior period asset disposals. Expense of $2.2 billion was down 1% year-on-year.  For the full year, we had long-term net inflows of $23 billion in a challenging environment, driven predominantly by fixed income, multi asset and alternatives. In addition, we gathered $24 billion of liquidity flow this year. However, for the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $21 billion, obviously disappointing. But on a more positive note, we saw liquidity inflows of $35 billion this quarter, gaining share and strengthening our leadership position during this period of money market reform.  AUM grew 3% year-on-year, and overall client assets 4% to $1.8 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively, driven by net inflows, as well as higher market levels. And our long-term investment performance remained solid, with 80% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartile over five years. And we had record loan balances up 4%, and record deposit balances up 9%.  Moving to page 9, and corporate. Treasury and CIO was flat quarter-on-quarter, with a net loss of around $200 million, and other corporate was a loss of $144 million primarily driven by legal expense.  Turning to page 10, and the outlook. Looking forward to the first quarter, expect net interest income for the Firm to be up modestly, reflecting impact of the December rate hike, as well as continued loan growth. For asset management, expect revenue will be slightly less than $3 billion, reflecting seasonality of performance fees. And recall that last year's first quarter included a $150 million gain on the sale of an asset. On expense, expect CCB to be up around $150 million sequentially on higher auto lease depreciation, as well as seasonally higher compensation and marketing, and expect expense in the commercial bank to be up quarter-on-quarter to around $775 million as we continue to invest.  Obviously, we're looking forward to Investor Day, and we'll give you more detailed 2017 guidance then. So to wrap up, a record fourth quarter and a record year, both net income and EPS demonstrating the strength of the platform. We enjoyed revenue growth, we met our expense and capital commitments, increased payouts to shareholders, and generated good returns on higher capital. As we move into the New Year, we remain well-positioned, and are excited about the opportunities to grow the business by serving our clients and communities. With that, operator, we'll take Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Marianne, I was just wondering -- I know you'll give more at Investor Day, but just in terms of that first quarter starting point for NII, and just how it translates between growth in the balance sheet? And then you mentioned the benefit from the rollover in rates, can you help us just try to think about -- just you parse those views out, and think about volume versus rate? Marianne Lake : Yes. So hey, Ken, you guys have a busy day today. So I would say that in the first quarter is always a quarter in which we have a bunch of different factors. And most notably, you also have day count issues in the first quarter. So I can go through that, but I would say most of the benefit which we expect to be up modestly will be driven by the rate increase, with growth being offset by day count, that's sort of fundamentally how to think about it.  It's probably more instructive to think about the full year. And so if you recall back to the third quarter, just to kind of reorient everyone, at that point when we didn't have the December hike, we said rates flat. So on growth alone, we would expect NII for the full year to be up about $1.5 billion. Obviously, we have had the 25 basis point hike in December. And based upon that alone, so now the new rate's flat, that $1.5 billion would be about 3, a little over 3. So for the full year, we're expecting on the December hike alone, that it would be about half volume and about half rate. Ken Usdin : And if I could ask a follow-up? Just on the volume side, you had another great year of double-digit loan growth, and obviously, we're at this intersection between kind of the -- what was and then the what will be. Any change to that expectation you could just grow the loan bit book, a core loan book that is, as strongly as you have in the past few years? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I think the way to think about it, and again, I think we talked a little bit about it last quarter, and you maybe see it in the fourth quarter. So we've been growing our loans in the 10-15%, we revised that to be at the top end of that range so we've been growing at around 15% core loan growth, the fourth quarter was 12%. So I wouldn't call it a deceleration per se, but know it is a little bit lower so I think going into 2017 our expectation is that we would continue to grow loans strongly but possibly at the lower end of that range rather than the higher and of course, to a degree it will depend upon our mortgage portfolio but we intend to continue to add to that too, so sitting here today I'd say more high single 10% plus or minus and we'll give you more updates at Investor Day. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the forward look NII up a bit but also expenses up a bit and I just wanted to understand is that because you've got the opportunity to reinvest in things that you haven't been able to and if you could just speak to what caned of time frame the reinvestment will yield returns because the question I've gotten from people is why aren't you dropping the NII benefit to the bottom line here. Marianne Lake : So just taking the two things separately, I would say the NII up 5 is dropping to the bottom line but as we, you saw all of our underlying drivers across all of the businesses. Volumes, transactions, everything is growing very strongly and although we still have some work to do to finish the large expense programs we're near the end of that, so just generally speaking, we're continuing to invest in the businesses and we'll see the improvement in our expenses flatten out and start to grow with volumes and that would also support growth in non-interest revenue outside obviously as the card phenomenon we talked to you about. Betsy Graseck : And then related follow-up has to do with how you're thinking about the excess cash you've got and the balance sheet duration and if there's anything in this new interest rate environment that you would be seeking to optimize your position. Marianne Lake : Right. So when we think about our investment securities portfolio, we think about it as responding to structural changes in our balance sheet which predominantly is driven by loans and deposits and it's always important to remember because we focus a lot on structural interest rate risk that it also is liquidity and liquidity risk. In this quarter there was a combination of things you saw that we grew deposits at more strongly than loans this quarter so we had some excess cash as well as the fact that rates rose so two things happened in our investment securities portfolio. Mortgages extended and we did add to duration but we have a very disciplined risk Management framework that's been consistent three times based on our expectations to normal rates in the future and we just executed on that strategy. Betsy Graseck : Okay so no change to duration? Marianne Lake : Yes, we added to duration in accordance with our framework. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about some more color in card trends, you have exciting new products out there. How are the economics of the sapphire reserve card been coming in relative to your expectations and what factors drove the decision to cut the original promotion back and should that affect your account acquisition costs? Thanks. Marianne Lake : Great, so obviously, the sapphire reserve card is still quite young or still quite new but relative to our modeled expectations even at the intro promo premium. Things are coming in line or better than our expectations. Now obviously we need to continue to that but we are very encouraged by not only the excitement in our customer base but also the way that the trends are performing in terms of spend and engagement, but when we introduce a new product we intentionally introduce a very exciting premium promo and its intended to generate excitement and I think you would agree it did, so we're delighted with the response that we've had and we've actually kept it up for longer than we initially expected but it's normal for us to come down from those intro rates as the product becomes more mature and that's what we are doing but to be very clear about our expectations of the performance of the card even at 100,000 points. We still expected the card to be a strong return and very accretive so obviously, at a lower premium it would be more so but one last thing I would say is everybody gets very interested the upfront points. It's our opinion that the real value to consumers of that card happens over time with their spend behavior and to take the points down from 100,000 to 50,000 has less than a 10% reduction in the overall value through the lifetime of the customer on average. John McDonald : Okay, and just as a follow-up on that, in terms of the card credit quality it's been very good. Would you still expect to see though seasoning as the book matures what kind of outlook would you have on the card charge-offs? Marianne Lake : So the charge-offs came in for the year at 2.63% which is in line with the guidance that we gave I think in November that Kevin Waters gave. He's given guidance for 2017 as we continue to see the newer vintages season, our 2.75% plus or minus and that's still our expectations, so the newer vintages are performing in line with our expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : I know that you've said previously that regulatory reform or regulatory relief will unlikely have any fundamental change in terms of how you're thinking about budgeting but I'm wondering if you could help us understand sort of over the past few years how much has regulatory costs grown and has that peaked anyway and can you give us a sense of how that could trend over the next few years either the natural trend of it or what the impact would be of regulatory reform. Marianne Lake : Yes so I'll give you a couple of things and hopefully that will help. So I think a year or so ago we talked about the fact that I'm going to now talk about cost of controls more broadly than just regulatory, that the cost of controls had increased for the Company by about $3 billion over several years, but that we expected they would peak and start bending down and that is indeed what we have been seeing.  Now I'm not saying that bend down is a sharp bend as we continue to be held to very sort of hard compliance burdens, but nevertheless we are seeing some efficiencies as we mature our processes and automate them. Offsetting against that and one of the reasons why it may be less obvious is that we've continued to increase our spend in cyber security as we want to protect the bank and the customers data. So naturally, that is happening. We are not going to continue at this point carving out the cost of regulatory or control because that is our operating, our new normal and until we understand whether or not the forward-looking landscape is changed, we won't be able to give you any kind of idea about how and when that will impact our expenses but we will continue to be more and more efficient and certainly, if we are able to take a step back and look at the rules and regulations and the way that they are being implemented and make rational changes to it, if that is something that is allows us to become more efficient then we will certainly do that and keep you informed. Erika Najarian : Great, and just as a follow-up to John's question on card trends, when you look at the card revenue rate declining about 200 basis points or so year-over-year, is your response to this question essentially implying that we've potentially hit peak promotion in 2016 and perhaps the revenue rate will have some stability to it in 2017? Marianne Lake : So I think in the conference in November, Kevin Waters said that as we look at the new products and we look at them growing coming out in 2016 and into 2017, we would expect the card revenue rate for the year next year to be about 10.5% after which as the cards and their accounts season and drive revenue growth we should see that continue to trend back up to a level in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : So Jamie your comment said that the U.S. economy may be gaining momentum. If you can give some of the basis for that comment, is it more risk by investors or more CapEx by companies or is this more hope? Jamie Dimon : I mean, I think that it's actual detail of Retail spend, auto sales, house prices, household formation, confidence numbers, so I'm not basing it on the market just based if you look at a broad range of things that looks like growth may have gotten a little bit better in the fourth quarter plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan is doing a little better, Europe is doing better in fact one of the IMF came out yesterday and both global growth will tic up next year so it's just those factors. Mike Mayo : Is that enough for you to say you're going to invest a little bit more or higher more people or expand a little bit more and along those lines, how do you see market share gains potentially? Jamie Dimon : Not going to change our plans very much because we don't really react that much to the weather, because we grow to add bankers and stuff you know you have to do it through a cycle. I do think of it as regulatory relief. You will see banks be more aggressive in growing opening branches in new cities, adding to Loan Portfolios, seeking out clients they don't have so I'm hoping to see a little bit of that too but they will wait for regulatory relief. Mike Mayo : Why are you saying this might be a little bit more weather that this might be more sustainable when you say the economy might be turning? Jamie Dimon : I'm saying we don't react to the small change in the economy to how we grow and expand our business but it looks to us if you look across the broad spectrum, Capital Expenditures, business confidence, consumer confidence, household building, household formation, wage income, unemployment going down, auto sales going up, Retail sales going up it looks like it's stronger not weaker. That's just my own personal belief. Marianne Lake : And maybe just if we give you a bit of insight into the philosophy about how we do our investment and expense budgeting when we talk to our businesses, regardless to Jamie's point about necessarily whether the external factors are moving, the question is what do we want to do in terms of products and services and technology and bankers and offices that we can execute on well and responsibly and that is typically what defines us not our appetite to investor dollars, so I think we've told you pretty consistently that and you've seen it we added 130 net new bankers, we opened eight offices in the commercial bank, we're investing in technology very, very broadly, payments, digital across the Company so I would say that we don't feel like we've been held back in terms of our appetite to invest because of concern around the economy and in the same way, a more confident outlook in the economy won't step change that but we will continue to look for great investments everywhere we can and make them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe we could talk a little bit about the Investment Bank. Obviously your peers and a lot of investors have been growing in their optimism for this you're in terms of animal spirits and everything else and just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about it do you share that optimism and any commentary on how we can think about both banking and trading into the New Year with all of the moving parts that we have around policy, etc. Thanks. Marianne Lake : So I would say just if we separate the two and just talk for one second about banking, you know fundamentals for a solid M&A year are there and obviously there will be puts and takes depending on what happens in the policy and reforms space, but we're optimistic about a solid M&A market but with the continuing trend of fewer mega deals but nevertheless good flow. At ECM looks set to be quite active and the IPO market continuing to recover and debt Capital Markets has a solid pipeline in terms of the refinance arena, but having said that interest rates may have an impact so I think pretty solid pipeline coming into the year but lots of factors will ultimately affect the full year. With respect to trading, Jamie said that we don't look at the first couple of weeks, but so far so good and what I would tell you is we said this before where a client flow oriented business and there will be a lot of micro and event-driven activity and as long as it's not discontinuous, we should be able to inter immediate transactions with our clients and so far, generally there's been more risk appetite in the investor days but that can change very quickly as we saw in previous quarters so we will be there to support our clients and if they are active, everything should be good but it can change quickly. Jim Mitchell : And maybe as a follow-up on the expense side. The comp ratio in the Investment Bank dropped around 240 basis points this year or last year. Do you think that's sustainable into 17 assuming flat to up revenues or was there anything unusual in there? Marianne Lake : So just reminding you about our sort of philosophy on comp revenue, it's just a calculation obviously we pay for shareholder value-added so you need to take into consideration the fact that we've had over time increased capital levels and liquidity levels and that's reflected in a declining overall comp to revenue ratio. I would say that there are three factors to it being lower. The first is the strength in performance and pay outs aren't linear and as you have stronger performance, you would expect to see a lower ultimate outcome but importantly, we were some tail winds in the numbers this year included a stronger dollar so as we pay remember comp to revenue isn't just on the front office compensation, it all supports our salaries [indiscernible] and compensation and we have a large number of people that we pay not in dollars so that was a bit of a tail wind. Some of that will carry on but maybe not at the same level and we also just did our normal regular hygiene and productivity in terms of the how we think about the workforce and pay. At the end of the day, we pay for performance, we think very competitively to retain for the best team on the street and make sure that our shareholders are getting a fair share of any outperformance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR. Paul Miller : Jamie, one of the things we're seeing some of the new politicians coming and talking about opening up to credit box especially in the mortgage world that has been really shutdown over the last years, mainly to the rules coming from all of the things, Fannie, Freddie, what type of things do you need to see or do you think they can do to open up that credit box where banks can take more risk and be protected? Marianne Lake : Simplifying the securitization rules because we've done some securitizations. We think they are each lent but that would open up the market a little bit, clarifying Safe Harbors on certain types of underwriting. For example, it's very hard and risky for a bank to make a loan to first time buyers, former bankruptcies even though it could be very good people with brand new jobs, self-employed it's hard to necessarily do all of the income verification stuff lick that, simplifying servicing, the services standards now have I think nationwide we have 3000 different standards. It's very costly. It's very expensive. It's kind of risky if you make a mistake the punishment is pretty high and all those things that should be done for the good of the United States of America. Not for the good of JP Morgan Chase and so I do think it's too tight and there's one thing you get around too quickly it will help the housing market a little bit, help the housing formation, reduce the cost of mortgages and make it available to more people. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So I guess the question for either one of you is if we do get some lower taxes and/or better rate environment, I'm curious on your confidence on how much of that can fall to the bottom line because there's a lot of optimism about what can happen, stocks have moved well, we're expecting that to move to the bottom line. There's the big concern that people have is it gets competed away by irrational behavior so curious to get your thoughts on that just big picture in general if things go well how much of that are you repaying? Marianne Lake : So starting off with sort of interest rates and obviously we've talked for an extended period of time about the fact we've positioned the Company to benefit when rates rise, we built the branches, acquired the accounts, we've built the technology and services so we've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits of that. With respect to how much will go to the bottom line, we have been we think appropriately conservative when we have given you guidance about ultimately how much incremental NII we would expect in a more normal rate environment. If you go back to Investor Days of past you would see we said when normalized we would expect 10 plus billion dollars and embedded in that are assumptions obviously around rates paid. We think that rates paid will be higher this time in this cycle than in previous cycles for a bunch of reasons including as you said competition for High Quality liquidity balances, but also we are coming off of zero rates and the improvement in technology so we've been we think appropriately conservative but we'll find out in the fullness of time. So far two rate hikes rates at 50 basis points it's too early and so far, you would expect that to be in there an it's not linear and everything is behaving quite rationally right now, so we in fact if anything a little better than we had modeled so we'll keep watching it and we think we've been thoughtful. We don't know the right answer, and we'll keep you updated as we see how things progress. Jamie Dimon : And just on the tax side, so you understand generally, yes if you reduce the tax rates all things being equal to 20% of something eventually that increased return will be competed away. That is a good thing, so it's not a good thing for JP Morgan Chase per se but it's a good thing for the world, it's a good thing for growth and a lot of studies actually show the beneficiary of that is wages and so it's important to understand that good tax policy is good for growth and the country in general. It's not just good for companies that will eventually be competed away. Glenn Schorr : So when should I take that lower tax rate out of my model, kidding. Jamie Dimon : Listen you aren't going to really know for probably nine months to a year exactly what it is so I wouldn't worry too much about it and just remember the most efficient companies do benefit from things like this more than others. Glenn Schorr : The real follow-up I had was the concept of interest deduct ability, if that is the means that they use to pay for the tax hikes, it feels to us like a bad thing, I'm just curious on how you think it impacts your franchise from anything from debt underwriting to anything else? Jamie Dimon : I think if you look at again, there's a lot of wood to be chopped and sausage to be made before tax reform gets done and some of these things are brand new and they've never been talked about or done before so you can read a lot of studies obviously for banks to run net interest income so it doesn't directly change how you look at it so for everybody else it affects complete industries differently. How you leverage differently, utilities will be a different position and unleveraged companies and plus people will be able to convert what would have been interest expense to some other kind of expense so let the work get done before we spend too much time guessing about it. Marianne Lake : I also think that while interest deductibility is one point repatriation of cash is another point and there are puts and takes and you have to see the whole package before you can see what the net impact is, but ultimately if these things get done rationally and grow the economy then it's good from our franchise just broadly so don't focus on DCM, focus on the whole thing and I think when you get the whole package if it's done well which we hope will happen, then it will be good for the economy, good for our clients and good for our whole franchise. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: If I could circle back to the discussion on the net interest income and rate leverage the outlook for net interest income to grow over 3 billion versus 1.5 before the rate increase it's obviously a nice lift for a 25 basis point bump on the shortened, so I guess one, does that include the benefit of longer term rates since they've moved up as well since 9/30 which I assume it does but just to confirm that and secondly what's the leverage to rising rates from here as we think about movements in both short and long end. Marianne Lake : So yes, Matt it does include the benefit of higher long en rates and if you get the Q an get our disclosure on net income risk you'll get math that looks similar to that $1.5 billion or more, and then with respect of sensitivity from here, clearly it's not linear, so you can see if we just look at the Third Quarter, the first hundred basis points this is an illustration of $2.8 billion, 200 basis points of 4.5 so as we clip away, 25 basis points a time or $2.8 billion will start to come down and so that's broadly the outlook. And the next 10-Q will show the next. Jamie Dimon : But obviously it's less and less as rates go up. It's not linear, unless we actively change the ratio which we may also do at one point. Matt O'Connor: And actually my follow-up question, on the size of the balance sheet you did talk about loan growth of about 10% this year, if you look full year 16 versus 15 the balance sheet or the earning assets only rose 1% so maybe tie that into as you think about duration, the fact that you're sitting on a lot of liquidity and cash and how we should think about both overall growth in the balance sheet and then potentially some more remixing. Marianne Lake : Yes, so what you saw happen in 2016 was not only obviously a rotation from securities and deploying deposits into loans but also we took a very large amount of non-operating deposits out of the balance sheet in 2016 so that is having an impact but we would expect to continue to grow our loans to grow our deposits strongly to manage the overall balance sheet through our investment securities portfolio and from here, if everything continues to be as the market implies we should see margin expansion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question on the credit and reserve releases as it relates to the energy and metals and mining portfolio. Now that you've actually seen better credit in there how much of the reserves are left in that portfolio and can you still see reserve releases going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes, so answer is across the metals and mining and energy, we have a little over $1.5 billion of reserves and there is a normal level of reserves that we will have that would be a large chunk of that and as you saw in 2016, we did take charge-offs of a little less than $300 million, so we will continue to likely see on a name specific basis as people work through their business models that there will be more charge-offs but ultimately if anything stays stable or improves, and of course we have to see that be somewhat sustained and find its way flowing through the financial statements of our clients then as we upgrade them god willing then we will see more reserve releases but it's going to take some time and we'll start to see that think about the large reserves we took. We took them at the tail end of 15 and into 2016 we'll start to see new financial data from our clients, we'll start to do the borrowing base redeterminations and look at the impact of prices on reserves in the Spring so we'll start getting data this year so we may see more releases but it's going to come through over time. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then also on theory against strong loan growth year-over-year, I understand you're focusing in these housing constraints Markets but is there a limit to how much you can grow in those Markets? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would say that when I talk about the overall core loan growth going down still being strong, it does reflect the fact that we've been seeing very strong outperformance in our growth over the course of the last couple of years particularly in commercial term lending and while we continue to believe there's great opportunities there, they will be lower so we've been printing in the teens pretty consistently and I would say it will be less and maybe more in the high single-digits but we will keep you updated. There's still plenty of opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Just to follow-up a couple more questions on card. I know you've talked quite a bit about it already. But one of the sort of conventional wisdoms at the moment is that 2016 represented the pinnacle of the intensification of the competitive environment and I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether that's an accurate assessment or not. Marianne Lake : Well I don't know that I would ever try to decide what moment is the time is the pinnacle but I would say you saw us invest heavily in the business in 2015 and 16 across a number of different fronts. You saw us proactively renegotiating the card program deals for the vast majority of our portfolio and investing very heavily in exciting new products and in both cases while it has had an impact on our revenues in one case in the short-term and another case more structurally in both cases these are still very attractive returns, and so card is still a very attractive ROE business, very important to our customers. We are after deep engaged relationships through time with them and so we are going to continue to invest in growth. Eric Wasserstrom : Just on that point, the ROA expectations that you have as a consequence of the trends you just underscored do you consider these to be the sustainable as you get back to that 11% kind of revenue yield? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak from Nomura. Steve Chubak : I wanted to start off with a big picture question on the trading side. You made some recent remarks talking about the outlook for the FIC business and alluded to roughly half of the declines versus the peak being attributable to cyclical as well as secular factors and a lot of FIC optimism in particular we've spoken with have latched on to your remarks and I was hoping you could provide context as to how you determine the 50/50 split, should we be taking those comments literally and how you're thinking about the FIC fee trajectory overall as those cyclical headwinds are made. Jamie Dimon : We did try to analyze it because we got asked a lot about what was secular so you could break apart your exotic derivatives, certain types of CDOs. Of course the whole spectrum there are things that disappeared and we would be done no more for better or worse and in some cases like a CDO didn't go away because the person is still a credit buyer so they just went to another product but that was our best estimate. I don't want to overdo it or anything like that. I also said the actual market making requirements are going to be going up over time talking about 20 years, not the next quarter or next month. Remember we don't run the business next quarter next month, because Assets Under Management are going up and these corporations are going up, fixed income mortgage will go up, need for FX goes up and needs for hedges go up so over time we know there's a cyclical increase and we try to estimate how much is cyclical and there will be a flip side of that and I think you might have gotten to the end of the secular cyclical decline. Steve Chubak : Thanks, Jamie that's extremely helpful color, and Marianne maybe just switching over to the expense side for a moment. You also provided very helpful detail on some of the drivers of the strong expense progress you've seen in CIB in particular and from what I recall last year's update Daniel actually guided to an expense target of about 19 billion by 2017. It looks lick you've gotten there essentially a year early and I'm wondering whether there are more savings initiatives that have not yet been filtered through and could potentially accrete in coming year. Marianne Lake : So I will obviously give you a lot more detail about all of this at Investor Day but really quick because I knew the $19 billion would get some excitement. If you go back and talk to yourself to look at the specifics on the slide you should see that the $19 billion that he guided to did have some assumptions about some legal costs in there. The CIB didn't have legal costs in the year and as a result, it's still a little higher on an apples-to-apples basis than that would imply. Additionally I talked about the tail winds in terms of a stronger dollar. Now for full disclosure we have intentionally reinvested some of that but it was a tail wind that meant that apples-to-apples it would still be a little higher. I'd tell you compared to the targets that they set we still have a few hundred million dollars to deliver them and Daniel will go through that at the Investor Day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about rate of trading. To my mind, that was a product that's done particularly well this quarter but I was wondering looking forward how you see that performing whether it's supported by what's going on in yield curve or whether do you see that supported more by sort of like one off euphoria around election so maybe that might tail off a little bit and then just moving on from that, how do you view the opportunities for growth in your Capital Markets businesses, your CIB versus say your lending businesses. Are you equally enthusiastic about both given the opportunity sets going forward or do you see something more positive than others? Marianne Lake : Okay, so just to talk about rate trading for a second. You're right, that it was a part of the strength story in the fourth quarter this year. It was also a strong fourth quarter last year which is pretty much the only reason why we didn't call it out as a bigger driver of the year-over-year growth but it was a strong performance in the quarter and we would expect that to continue at it's much more interesting to for our clients to trade around a moving yield curve and rates above zero so as we see rates normalize we would fully expect that to be ultimately a beneficiary to the franchise in terms of clients trading and positioning and hedging around that over time and so wonder if that would be the case. In terms of the excitement and enthusiasm of our businesses lending versus we're enthusiastic about all of our businesses and would want to defend share and grow them all, and in the reality of the CIB revenue performance in Markets and in general, it was very strong in 2016, so we will try our hardest to replicate that. But it will be a challenging comparison but we're proud of it, so we gained share competitively over the course of the last couple years and so I don't think you should necessarily expect that we can continue to gain share at that pace but defend that we will. Unidentified Analyst : It sounds maybe that you'll have the pressures of year on year growth and CIB business but you aren't really highlighting that in terms of your learning businesses which obviously you'd expect further margins to grow the loan books to grow. Jamie Dimon : I think the better way to look at CIB lending is it's kind of episodic and goes in and out. A lot of corporations don't need to borrow and when they do it may be inconsistent because of M&A or something like that or book will always be driven by certain types of activity so the loan book isn't something the CIB loan book isn't something to say that you're growing. That is more serving clients in the way they need. One of the things I want to point out which is of course all of our businesses but just take trading in particular is we're always creating efficiencies and part of what we invest is big data, processing electronic exchanges, online services, lick I think 97% of FX I think it's 50% or 60% of US interest rate swaps, all these things have become electronic and digitized straight through for clients so that's where some of the investments are going and you'll see more of that not less but it also creates another round of efficiencies every time we do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you give us some color, in the past you've talked about in the multifamily I know you commented on that in your prepared remarks on your multifamily book, some of the Markets that you continue to be a little wary of can you give us an update to those types of thoughts? Marianne Lake : Yes, so we talked before about we had in certain Markets already pulled back not necessarily because you had a crystal ball because we saw them getting saucy before the energy decline, Dallas and Houston would be examples, parts of Brooklyn would be examples of that. I would say watching more carefully, you've seen us. We have that there is some supply coming through in Markets, Seattle, Denver, D.C. , San Francisco, we're still very active but just keeping an eye on those Markets but the supply pipeline while it's real does not look like it did when we saw the real pressure on the Real Estate business back in the 80s and 90s so we're keeping an eye on it. Gerard Cassidy : And I know you talked about the duration of the securities portfolios it's in line with-- Jamie Dimon : We don't want to give you all of our secrets in that business, we do have much but we're very disciplined about where we see supply and supply and demand and pricing and we would have no problem not going at all. We don't sit at meetings here and say can you go at 10% or 12? No, if we can't meet what we think is proper risk return we aren't going to grow at all. We'll shrink, we have no problem doing that so the other thing I want to point out about CTLs, the exceptional performance of CTL through the last Great Recession. We were really pleased with how that happened so we try to look at all these things through the cycle not just what are they doing in good times. Gerard Cassidy : Certainly. And Marianne coming back to the investment portfolio, obviously you talked a little bit about the duration. Do you have the actual duration of it in years, this quarter versus the third quarter? Marianne Lake : We don't disclose that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Bernall from Wells Fargo. Matt Bernall : Just a quick question for you Marianne, in terms of the mortgage in the overall picture, I understand why you're talking about maybe 10% core loan growth rather than 15% more recently, but just within the residential mortgage portfolio, it looks like that slowed in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter from a midteens year-over-year rate to a low single-digit quarter-over-quarter rate. Can you give us a little more color as to what's going on there, are you slowing your purchases of your own originations or is there something else going on there? Marianne Lake : So there's a couple different things. First of all, about a little more than half of our originations are jumbo. We retain all of those, and then when you look at the conforming space, it's really honestly consistently the best execution decision and so in particularly in this quarter, it speaks a bit more to our correspondent conforming volume, it's the lowest margin product and it does somewhat frequently toggle backwards and forwards in terms of better execution whether we would retain or sell it but we intend to keep adding to our portfolio, we like the mortgage asset classes, even those spreads have compressed in the fourth quarter, OAS and ROEs are holding up so I would expect us to continue to grow it strongly and from quarter to quarter it may go up or down a few percent but over at year we'll continue to add to the portfolio. Matt Bernall : So no real change in your thinking there? Marianne Lake : No. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : The thing that jumped out at me was if you looked at the Asset Management group you had $21 billion of long term product outflows and you had $35 billion in liquidity products inflows, and it seems like now that we're getting past financial crisis when everybody was looking at liquidity, that combining that with continued deposit growth we aren't seeing a change in that perspective but there's still a premium for increasing liquidity still. Jamie Dimon : I think there was a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, particularly relating to actively managed product. I think you're accurate but we haven't seen everybody else yet but I think you will be true when we see everybody. Unidentified Analyst : Do you foresee that premium for liquidity lessening as we kind of go into the rerisking of better economy and some things to improve the outlook? Jamie Dimon : That's a really hard question to answer. I'd have to think about that a little bit. Unidentified Analyst : And then my last thought was when you look at M&A, we had M&A kind of suppressed when things were more regulatory constrained and the outlook was negative on the overall economy and uncertainty. Now we have this positive uncertainty. Wouldn't that delay some activity for at least a couple quarters for people to kind of see where we are going to end up and see where tax rates are and see what we might get in deregulation that may change perspective on the long term opportunities, so just thought there might be a little pause here. Marianne Lake : I think that everything is going to end up being reasonably named specific so that may be true in some cases but so from companies and industries where deregulation and what would be more helpful but generally as I said the trend is towards lower sorry less mega deals, more flow and fundamentals are in pretty good shape and then there will possibly be tail winds in terms of tax reform and other things so I think net-net, we think the underlying flow in the M&A market and fundamentals are set to have a pretty positive year. Unidentified Analyst : I just thought maybe the second half versus the first half but thanks for your response. Marianne Lake : We'll see. No more questions, Operator? Operator : There are no further questions. Marianne Lake : Okay, thank you, everyone. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. Operator : This does conclude todays call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand-by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thanks operator and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, we are off to a good start this year with net income of $6.4 billion, EPS of $1.65, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $25.6 billion with the continuing momentum from last year driving strong performance across all of our businesses. Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 9% year-on-year, reflecting growth trends across products; continued double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 11%. In addition, we achieved a number of records across our businesses, most notably net income and IB fees for a first quarter in the CIB; net income and revenue for the commercial bank; and asset under management and banking balances in asset and wealth management. Overall, the credit environment remained benign. In consumer, there were no reserve actions taken across our core portfolios while in wholesale we had a net reserve release of about $90 million driven by energy, resulting in net releases in both the CIB and the commercial bank. We see no significant items here on the page, but there are a few notable items in our results that I will highlight here too. The first is the tax benefit, a bit less than $400 million and the benefit relates to the difference in stock price between vesting date and grant date for our employee equity award. And while such an adjustment is business as usual, the recent appreciation in our stock price has caused the benefit to be outside this quarter with the largest impact occurring to CIB and to a lesser extent asset and wealth management. Second is a write-down of our student loan portfolio of approximately $160 million after tax as we move these loans to held-for-sale and explore alternatives to that portfolio. And last is Firm-wide legal expense of around $140 million after tax relating to a number of matters across businesses, some positive and negative, and with the most significant impact being in the AWM business. Moving on to page 2 and some more detail about the first quarter. Revenues of $25.6 billion was up $1.5 billion or 6% year-on-year with the increase evenly split between net interest income and non-interest revenue. NII reflected the impact of higher rates and continued growth, and NII reflected higher CIB revenues, partially offset by card acquisition cost and lower MSR risk management. Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 7% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher compensation on increased revenue and higher auto lease depreciation. In addition, the combination of the impact of the FDIC surcharge as well as a foundation contribution this quarter accounted to nearly $200 million of the year-on-year expense change. Adjusted for the student lending write-down I just mentioned, credit cost of $1.1 billion will be down approximately $700 million year-on-year as higher charge-offs in card were offset by a wholesale net reserve release this quarter versus a sizeable build in the prior year. Moving to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with both standardized and advanced fully phased-in CET1 of 12.4%, in line with our expectations and overall driven by net capital generation. We continue to manage our balance sheet with discipline. Total assets returned to above $2.5 trillion, reflecting the continuation of strong deposit growth as well as our trading balance is normalizing from very low levels at the end of the year. From a liquidity perspective, HQLA was flat at year-end and the Firm remained compliant with all liquidity requirements. We continued to grow tangible book value per share while returning $4.6 billion of net capital to shareholders in the first quarter, which included $2.8 billion of net repurchase and common dividend of $0.50. And this $4.6 billion compares to $3.8 billion returned last quarter. As you know, we recently submitted the 2017 CCAR capital plan to Federal Reserve. And as you\u2019d expect, we have no feedback to give you for now. Moving on to page four, and the consumer and community bank. CCB generated $2 billion of net income and ROE 15%. Core loans were up 11% with strength across products. Mortgage was up 15%, card up 9%, business banking up 9% and auto loans and leases up 12%. Deposit growth continued to outperform industry, up 11% with about half of deposit growth from existing customers as we continue to deepen relationship. We continued to see very strong growth metrics in card for the quarter with sales up 15% and new account originations up 9%. Merchant processing volumes were up 11% year-on-year and active mobile customers up 14%. Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly; consumer and business banking revenue was up 8% on strong deposit growth and we are starting to see the long-awaited improvement in deposit margins. Mortgage revenue was down 18%, driven by lower net servicing revenue, reflecting lower MSR risk management as well as portfolio run-off. And card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 3% driven by continued investment in card new account acquisitions that will provide long-term value. It was predominantly offset by net interest income on higher loan balances as well as higher auto lease income. Expense of $6.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year on auto lease depreciation and continued business growth. Finally, the credit trend in our core portfolio remained favorable. Net charge-off increased year-on-year, primarily driven by a $470 million write-down of our student loan portfolio, against which we released $250 million of reserve and card charge-offs were up in line with expectations and in line with guidance. Moving to mortgage and auto credit, our portfolio is continues to perform very well. Now turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB delivered a strong result with reported ROE of 18% and net income of $3.2 billion. But remember, a significant portion of the tax benefit on the stock update is reflected in these results. Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 17% year-on-year and IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 37%, partly due to a weak first quarter last year, but also given strong absolute performance this year. In banking, IB revenue was up 34%, driven by higher overall issuance, especially in ECM including a strong IPO market. Remember, the first quarter of 2016 was particularly strong in M&A and weak in DCM for us. And this quarter, they are normalized. Overall, we gained share and ranked number one in global IB fees and number one in North America and EMEA. Looking forward sentiment is positive, market remains broadly constructive; and across products, we expect decent deal flow and the pipeline healthy. Treasury services revenue of $981 million was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and operating deposit growth. Lending revenue of $389 million was up 29% year-on-year on higher gains on securities received from restructurings. Moving onto markets and investor services. Markets revenue of $5.8 billion, was up 13%. At the Investor Day, the market was characterized by low volatility and subdued client activity, leading us to be somewhat cautious. March ended up being stronger than expected, reflecting some recovery in volatility, but also clients responding more to market themes including European elections and to a lesser degree stronger U.S. rates outlook. Fixed income revenue was up 17% with credit and securitized products as key drivers on stronger client activity and significant spread tightening broadly. Rates was also solidly up as the market reacted to central bank actions and we saw a pick-up of flows in EMEA. We had a decent quarter in equity with revenue up 2% year-on-year in somewhat quiet market broadly with corporate derivatives and prime being brighter spots. Securities services revenue was $916 million, in line with guidance. And finally, expense of $5.1 billion was up 7%, driven by higher performance based compensation, and the comps to revenue ratio for the quarter was 29%. Moving on to page six, and commercial banking. Another excellent quarter in commercial banking, with the 15% ROE, revenue grew 12% year-on-year due to higher deposit, NII and continued loan growth, as well as a strong IB revenue up 34%, making this the third consecutive quarter of IB revenues of over $600 million. Expense of $825 million was impacted by a $29 million impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, we saw expense increase slightly of our guidance as we made great progress on the pace of investment which will continue to drive strong top-line growth. Looking forward, we expect our underlying expense trends be relatively flat. Loan balances of $191 billion were up 12% over the prior year. Consistent with the industry broadly, we have seen a slowdown in C&I growth with our loan balances remaining relatively flat sequentially, although up 8% year-on-year. There are a number of factors likely contributing including potential noise in the data from large acquisitions in prior periods and a resurgence in capital markets activity, particularly in DCM including high yield. So, not to dismiss the importance of the trends, we do need to weigh all the facts and against that other macro indicators remain supportive of the economy broadly including CapEx, data and surveys, as well as very high levels of business optimism, all of which should be supportive of solid demand for credit over time. In commercial real estate, we saw sequential growth of 3%, slightly ahead of the industry but below the pace of prior quarters, impacted both by higher rate, as well as a prudent approach to new originations given where we are in the cycle and maintaining discipline on risk adjusted returns. Credit performance remains strong with a net recovery of 2 basis points reflecting continued stability in both our C&I and CRE portfolios, and overall, a net release loan of loss reserves driven by energy. Leaving the commercial bank and moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $385 million with pretax margin and ROE each of 16%. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up $3.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels and strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Recall that last year\u2019s first quarter included a one-time $150 million gain on the sale of an asset. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense. I want to emphasize that the underlying core business results remain very strong, in fact in line with the strongest performance of the business ever. This quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion with strength in fixed income and multi-assets being partially offset by outflows in equity. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion and overall client assets of $2.5 trillion were both up 10% year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels and net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products. Finally, banking balances continue to be strong with loan and deposit up 7% and 5% respectively. Moving onto page eight and corporate. Corporate generated $35 million of net income for the quarter. Treasury and CIO\u2019s results improved in part reflecting the benefit of high rates. And other corporate benefitted from the release of certain legal reserves. Finally, turn to page nine and the outlook. With the addition of the March rate hike, we\u2019ve updated our NII scenarios as follows : Rate flat from here for the full year NII will be up around $4 billion. Based on the implied, NII will be up by around $4.5 billion. And of course the Fed dots would imply the possibility of three rate hikes this year, which is not fully phased in. So, expect second quarter NII to be up sequentially, approximately $400 million, consistent with what we saw this quarter. To wrap up, these results reflect strength broadly across our businesses. We remain well positioned to benefit from client flows and a healthy economy as we serve our clients and communities, and we look forward to continuing to grow our business. With that, operator, you can open up the lines for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, Marianne. I just had a question about any early signs of deposit data and elasticity. I guess on the consumer side, in your retail banking area, are you seeing customers increasingly ask for higher rate in their deposit accounts or any activity where they are moving from kind of checking to savings and kind of early signs of pressure on deposit pricing? Marianne Lake : In the retail space, the answer is no, not really. And to be completely honest, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit re-price at absolute levels of rate that are still quite low. And so, with IOER at 100 basis points, we\u2019re still in that sort of realm of the atmosphere. And so, we would expect that to start happening -- a couple of rate hikes from here maybe; we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We\u2019ve obviously never really been through exactly this before. On the other side of the equation, in the wholesale space, we are in the process of seeing reprice happen. John McDonald : Got it. Okay. And in terms of customers, they\u2019re not really asking yet or behaving in a way that they\u2019re looking price sensitive; you\u2019re not seeing any early sign of it yet? Marianne Lake : No. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I wanted to maybe get out in front of what could be some bruise issues in retail lands. And the perspective I\u2019m looking for is you have plenty gross exposure to retail and retail related. However, there seems to be plenty of collateral, and you\u2019re typically at the top of the capital structure too. So, can you talk about both direct exposure in some of the problem retail areas and related exposure in like commercial real estate on the mall side? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I don\u2019t have all those numbers in front of me. I know that in the commercial bank, our exposure to mortgage is really pretty modest; it\u2019s around about total of $3 billion in the commercial real estate base. And I would tell you that while there obviously is a lot of discussion around retail and with some merit, it\u2019s very, case-by-case, location-by-location, specific and I kind of liken the discussion a lot to discussions we have around bricks and mortar banking businesses, which is consumer -- the way consumers engage with retailers is changing, it doesn\u2019t mean that will stop engaging with retailers. And so, it will be very specific with respect to location and tenants, and it doesn\u2019t necessary mean that retail is going to be in as much potential trouble as I think people are talking about. So, we remain cautiously -- watching it but we\u2019re very cautiously optimistic that it\u2019s not -- that it\u2019s a bit overblown. Jamie Dimon : And you should assume that we\u2019ve looked at not just direct retail or retail related real estate, all the vendors through any potentially sort of retailers. When you put it all together, it\u2019s a little bit like there will be something there but it\u2019s nothing [indiscernible]. Glenn Schorr : Is the main reason you\u2019re positioned and the in the stack meaning -- I notice you have a lot of collateral against your exposure and like I said, you tend to be at the top of the stack; is that the main issue? I remember doing this with you guys two years ago in oil while oil was dropping and it turned you barley came out with a few cuts and bruises; this seems to be more collateral here, but\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Are you talking about real estate related retail or are you talking about retail or are you talking about retailers? Glenn Schorr : I\u2019m talking both, because you do have hundreds of billions of direct retail exposure plus commercial real estate exposed to it. I\u2019m just making\u2026 Jamie Dimon : You are way out of line. I mean direct retail exposure, we\u2019re very careful; retail business has always been violent and volatile. You can look back to our history and half of them are gone after 10 years that is a normal course. So, we are usually senior; we\u2019re very careful of our debt. And when you go to real estate, most of the real estate has nothing to do with retail. So, we do have some shopping centers, malls and buildings and stuff like that. But those are generally items that well secured, not relying on single retailers et cetera. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I was just looking at taking a temperature. Jamie Dimon : It will be like oil and gas process; it won\u2019t be a big deal. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Marianne. Can you give us some color on the credit card area? In terms of -- I know you upped your credit card losses early in the year in investor day in the fall of last year. What\u2019s your guys\u2019 outlook for the credit losses and the credit card portfolio? Where would you tolerate it to and at what point do you really change the underwriting standards, if you need to? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, one of the things that we want to remind everybody before we talk about the trend is that the credit card losses are still at absolutely very, very low levels. And not withstanding whatever we would have done or have done or continue to do with our credit books, we would ultimately have expected them to normalize to higher rates regardless. Gerard Cassidy : Agreed. Marianne Lake : And then, obviously, the first quarter hasn\u2019t been... Jamie Dimon : Through the cycle... Marianne Lake : Yes, exactly. And obviously first quarter has some seasonality. So, I would just start by saying that the charge-off rates we\u2019re seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at Investor Day, both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium-term between 3 and 3.25. So, all the reasons that we articulated, a combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk adjusted margins. So, it\u2019s not really about tolerating the charge-offs, as long as we\u2019re getting paid properly for the risk, which is the case. And obviously as we see the charge-off rates normalize and reflect those newer vintages, they will go up modestly over time. And we expanded our credit in the targeted way, but it wasn\u2019t a significant expansion. And we will respond in our credit and risk appetite to whatever we\u2019re seeing in the environment, but it won\u2019t necessarily be predicated by charge-off rates. Gerard Cassidy : And as a follow-up, obviously you have very strong investment banking on the FICC trading side, very strong capital market numbers. Are you guys seeing further evidence of taking more market share from your competitors in any of the product lines, whether it\u2019s investment banking or FICC trading or equity trading et cetera? Marianne Lake : So, I would say, if you look back over 2016 and even 2015 and 2016, it\u2019s true and clear that we gained share, not just in fixed income, reasonable share, not just in fixed income but also in equity. And our business performed well last year. And I would suggest to you that we will defend that share, but the competition is back and healthy and you can\u2019t expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels, we want to defend it, but it\u2019s a healthy competitive market right now. So I would say not really. Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, one on card. How large are you willing to be in card? I think on various metrics, you\u2019re between 15% and 22% depending on if you\u2019re looking at things like merchant acquiring or at the balances and card in general as a percentage of total outstandings in the country? Jamie Dimon : We have a ways to go before we\u2019 concerned. Betsy Graseck :  [Multiple speakers] last cycle, you were nimble and do you still feel that you can be nimble at this market share? Jamie Dimon : For merchant processing, there is a lot share you can gain and that\u2019s not even close, because the products and services and change n technology. I think we\u2019re way away in credit card when you say well that\u2019s too big for JPMorgan Chase. There is a point where it\u2019s going to be a good question, but it\u2019s not even remotely close to this one. Marianne Lake : And I would also say that card continues to be a pretty competitive space. So, we will continue to try and provide our customers with significant value and have deep engaged relationships. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see material shift in share in the short-term. Jamie Dimon : And we also look strategically at credit card, debit card, online bill pay, P-to-P is all one big thing to do a great job for clients. Betsy Graseck : And then, when you\u2019re thinking about the credit box, I know a while back you mentioned, okay we\u2019ve widened the box to 680, is there any interest is widening it further? Marianne Lake : Not specifically at this point. I think we\u2019re very happy with the performance of the portfolio with the growth rate we are getting and our core card loans were up 9% year-over-year and was getting a lot of NII benefit from that. So I think we\u2019re still pretty well positioned at this point. Betsy Graseck : So, loan growth should probably stay in line with where it is or slow down, is that how we should we be thinking about? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would say, loan growth should be in the mid to high single digits. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. I am going to follow up on the NII question. I think your implied guidance of 4.5 billion higher than 2016 is now at the 500 million from where you were at the Investor Day. Is that lower deposit beta experienced, what\u2019s driving I guess the modest increase? And then, just as a follow-up on that in terms of if we do -- the implied curve I think has about one more rate hike in June, if we were to get another one, realize the dot plot too and another one in September, would that be immaterial increase in that expectation or just incremental or just how do we think about that? Marianne Lake : So, I would -- obviously when we give you guidance, we give you sort of reasonably rounded numbers. So, actually the impact of [indiscernible] is a bit more than $500 million, more than was at the Investor Day, and a lot of big numbers that are pretty reasonable. Yes, there is an element of course as we talk about in the wholesale space where we are seeing reprice happen and it does reflect our estimates as to what we expect to see over the course of the year in cumulative deposit basis. And with respect to if there was a note that implies -- one and half more hike. So, it\u2019s probably March is earlier, so longer -- a little bit more rate benefit but it\u2019s sort of in line with our expectations. And if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year and ultimately have relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward. Jim Mitchell : Okay, so anything in September would be sort of incremental? Marianne Lake : You should be able to extrapolate those numbers on your own. Jim Mitchell : Yes, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning. Marianne, you noted the obvious slowdown we\u2019ve seen in C&I, and Jamie, in the press release, you talk about the consumers and businesses being healthy in the pro-group initiatives. Since the analyst day, we obviously had Obamacare not go through and then there has been some doubt on tax reforms. So, just wondering can you help us understand just where you\u2019re seeing that slowdown in C&I and how would -- where are we in terms of that confidence turning into real results and how much is just the wait and see versus where the economy actually is? Marianne Lake : I think it\u2019s important to put that in context. I mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in C&I, we\u2019re just saying sequentially things are a bit quieter and there are whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that. And importantly, you mentioned it, when we are in dialogue with our clients, they are optimistic and they are thinking about growing their businesses and hiring and all of those things are true. And so putting aside those and we have access to capital market for a variety of reasons in newer bank loans. And it\u2019s completely understandable that optimism would lead actions. And so, what that implies, we\u2019ll wait and see but fundamentally a pro-growth series of policies will be constructive to the economy, to our clients and ultimately will end up. And them hiring, spending and they already are, and we\u2019ll see that translate into loan growth. Whether that\u2019s in the second half of this year, we\u2019ll see. Jamie Dimon : I wouldn\u2019t overreact to the short term in our loan growth with so many that affect it. When you go to the episodic part, when you look at CIB, I don\u2019t look at loan growth at all because companies have a choice of loans and deals or bonds and like that. Credit card looks okay, mortgage is obviously affected by interest rates, auto is obviously affected by auto sales, and middle market was okay, it was slow but it was okay. So, I wouldn\u2019t react to that. The second thing is, you all should expect as a given that when you have a new president and he gets going that nine months, after the 100 days it\u2019s going to be sausage making period. There will be ups and downs, wins and loss stuff like that. And what you see is a pro-growth agenda, tax infrastructure, regulatory reform and that is a good thing all things being equal. And we think that it should be helpful for Americans. To expect it to be smooth sailing, that would be silly. Ken Usdin : Yes, fair point, fair point. And just one quick follow-up just on the deal making side, M&A slowed a little bit, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the same point, Jamie just in terms of pipelines and expectations that corporates have about transacting. Does that fit into that same vein or is there anything different in terms of just companies getting strategic, getting more aggressive in terms of acquiring and adding to their businesses? Jamie Dimon : It looks fine but of course it\u2019s episodic. Marianne Lake : And I would also say that while of course people\u2019s dialogues include a degree of discussion around regulatory reform and tax reform and the like, it isn\u2019t stopping the strategic dialogue and it isn\u2019t stopping from -- or boards from considering strategic deals partly because of what you said, partly because there is a recognition that we think will take some to ultimately get finalized and really won\u2019t put their strategic agenda on hold. So, in some ways, you get both sides of the equation; people aren\u2019t going to wait indefinitely to get certainty on issues when there are good strategic deals that can be done and that\u2019s part of the dialogue, do not say has not impact but it\u2019s still quite healthy. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on deposit pricing in a sense that before the Fed starts moving up deposit rates and the Fed funds rates were right on top of each other around 15 basis points. Now the effective Fed funds rates around 90 basis points and deposit costs are only 20. So that\u2019s 70 basis points on your $1 trillion of deposits basically gives you about $7 billion worth of incremental revenue. This needed to cover the cost of branches and other things for those deposit franchise. At what point do you hit a targeted kind of spread and where is that where you begin to at least break even on those costs versus revenues? Jamie Dimon : Can I just answer that? Marianne has given you guys some very specific guidance on interest rates. When interest rates got to zero, remember that when it floored, no one expected 25 to 50 basis points to necessarily be paid out. This was a cost. Marianne also gave you at Investor Day, a very forward looking view of that where it kind of normalizes. And it\u2019s different for every different type of deposit. The wholesale deposits, commercial credit deposits, company deposits, treasury deposits, they\u2019re all different. So, it\u2019s hard to summarize it all. But at one point, you\u2019re going to back to kind of a normalized spread. In terms of just retail, I would say that\u2019s like 3%, maybe a little less. Marianne Lake : Maybe a little less. And I would also just say, I am glad that you brought up one point because, it\u2019s something that I like -- a point that I\u2019d like to make, which is when people think about the benefit we get from NII and rising rates, there is an element of people making it sound very passive. Yes, you\u2019re correct, we did build those loans, we acquired those customers, we built in the products, we invested in the customer service and so to be able to enjoy the industry-leading deposit rates that we\u2019re having. But I would also make -- and so as margins improved and we will obviously enjoy the benefit of that, and to your point, we invested to be able to. But I will say that if we look at the performance of our branches, every single week, month, individually together by market and the very, very, very vast majority of them, meaning there are only a handful are profitable in their own rights today at these spreads on a margin basis. So, the branches are doing very well. Jamie Dimon : Another number that we gave you, you should look at, we gave you what we expect normalized margins and normalized returns to be in consumer, card only businesses. There was numbers include normalized credit card charge-offs, like the credit card, the number we now use for the quarter, something like that. And in retail going back to normal spreads, that\u2019s what those numbers include. And of course, they all bounce around. We kind of look at the business, we price for normalized results, we don\u2019t price for, which is overearning or underearning and you have too much credit, too little, and that\u2019s kind of how we run the business. Marty Mosby : Follow-up to that is really what I\u2019m getting at is last year, everybody was assuming through the cycle kind of betas and we were saying that there will be much lower early on. We do think once you get to a certain target, usually about 100 basis points of spread, you start to see a little bit more pricing pressure starting to kick-in, just like you were saying Jamie different products\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We\u2019ve built that in every number we\u2019ve given you. We\u2019ve always told the beta and gamma. Marianne Lake : I can point you to our presentation in May of 2014 where we showed exactly what we expected deposit reprice to look like based upon historical moves. And so, what we have actually we\u2019re seeing today looks incredibly similar in terms of realized reprice. You\u2019re actually right. I will tell you thought that history may not be a precise predicator of the future, because we\u2019ve never really been in that exact position before, and other things play into the equation including the fact that the industry but us specifically have significantly invested in other customer service products, items like digital and the like, which will change the dynamic one way or another on reprice. So, you\u2019re right, historically 100, 150 basis points, if there\u2019s movement, we\u2019ll see. Marty Mosby : And the last component of this is, the balances continue to grow. So, as long as we\u2019re seeing double-digit kind of sequential annualized and year-over-year growth in deposits, that provides a little bit cover and the sense of what you\u2019re talking as well. We may see a little bit more lag, just because we\u2019re still kind of continuing to get deposit growth? Jamie Dimon : Yes. We feel great about deposit growth and the account growth. So, we have new accounts, we\u2019re growing and existing accounts are growing. Remember, you have to be very careful because if rates were higher, people do different things with their money, like CDs and then how they view the stock market, that money -- some of that is actually in this. So, we\u2019re always conscious of the fact that those flows ebb and flow and history is only a somewhat of a guide to that. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions on the regulation. Jamie, in your shareholder letter, you\u2019ve dedicated a lot of time on mortgage and have it opening that up for banks to originate more of the percentage of mortgage in the United States. As we look forward, do we need legislative change for the banks to gain more market share from non-banks in mortgage like clarity in QM or the CSPB or would changes in supervisory attitudes be enough for that to shift on the mortgage side? Jamie Dimon : I think that category out precisely because it didn\u2019t take legislation and it was very important. And my point isn\u2019t about banks versus non-banks. My point is about the United States of America and what these things did to the availability of credit to certain class of people. I was very specific, we actually published a research report in mortgage land, which you can go get by Mr. Joseph that really breaks it out. But because of the cost of servicing delinquent accounts, $2,000 a year, because of the additional cost of origination, because of the potential litigation, because of the not clarity around the QM, because of the forward claims that the consumers both pay more and the credit box is wider. And then, we actually believe that credit box is hurting first time buyers, younger, self employed, prior defaults. So, when defaults happen, they deserve a second change. So, the policy has restricted that. And the shocking thing to me is the absolute size of that which we think could be 3 to $500 billion a year. That one thing alone could edit -- if you think about second stagnations, could have been 0.3 or 0.4% a year growth, changed five years ago, you\u2019re talking about a lot of growth, a lot of jobs, a lot new homes, a lot of young families into homes and very positive, not taking a lot of extra risk, not -- it was about America, while we are executing less of the banks to non-banks. That\u2019s my point about that\u2019s how it\u2019s hurting growth of America and hurting that class of citizens. And I really think somebody should be right about that, that\u2019s how important it is. That was one example. Erika Najarian : That\u2019s clear. Thank you. And the follow-up to that is a couple of week ago or so, there was a lot of talk from Washington about the current administration potentially supporting Glass-Steagall and of course a lot of your investors called in concerned. And Jamie and Marianne, two part question; I am wondering if that\u2019s a real worry for JPMorgan shareholders? And second Marianne, maybe in Investor Day two years ago, you mentioned that the capital and the cost that a breakup would save, was not that much. And I am wondering if you could also -- if you remember, refresh us on that analysis? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, I will just start by saying we\u2019ve been consistent that our operating model including the diversification of our businesses has been and was a source of strength, not just for us but also for the financial market during the crisis, and there is strength in the way the company operates that can\u2019t be discounted. I would also say that the commentary feels unnecessary given where the industry stands on capital liquidity and regulatory reform broadly. And I know at this point, as I\u2019m sure you al read too, most recently Governor Tarullo making comment about but historically other thought leaders in the financial stability space I\u2019m talking about, and I would to say that it doesn\u2019t feel, for reasons that you\u2019ve articulated in terms of structural reform or structural change in model and things. So that would be consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the U.S. So, that\u2019s kind of how we feel about it. I can\u2019t give you specific reasons to not continue to monitor the situation, but it doesn\u2019t consistent with the rest of the objective of the administration. And with respect to Investor Day couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamental changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion hasn\u2019t, which is that we believe that there is significantly more value for our shareholders and as I said before, for the economy with this Company the way it is today than in some other forms. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: We\u2019ve obviously seen quite a bit of flattening of the yield curve and it could reverse pretty quickly if there is progress made on the pro-growth agenda, but just talk about at what point does the flatter yield curve start to impact NIM? And I guess I\u2019m thinking specifically if we get a couple more hikes on the short end but the long end either doesn\u2019t move, the long end comes down more. How do we think about the breakpoint in terms of NIM benefit with short end being offset by the flatter yield curve? Marianne Lake : First of all, we don\u2019t over think change of the curve or part of normalization in any one period, we think about the reason for the actions and ultimately as long as the economy is growing, you\u2019ll see both of the front end and long end of rate ultimately go up. And even though I know that is lower when we broken down, broken below a little bit of a low bound, seeing in the kind of 230, 260 range for a while. So, we\u2019re still within -- largely speaking within the range. And I anticipate that we are going to see the 10-year higher by the end of the year. And if you look our earnings disclosures, we\u2019re much more sensitive to -- as a pure NII NIM matter to the front end rate. And so not to say we would not have an impact, but it would take a while for that to have an impact that would meaningfully offset any of the benefit of higher short-end rate. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then separately, as we think about central banks winding down some of the QE and the Fed actually shrinking their holdings, how do you think about that impacting your businesses? Obviously there might be a rate impact; I think you talked about expectations quite a bit. But just how do you think it impact say from markets business with potentially more assets kind of out there to be purchased and sold? Marianne Lake : I mean ultimately any actions by central banks, anything, in the shape of the yield, anything that is presenting an opportunity for client to transact and trade, there is an opportunity for all businesses. So, as long as it happens in a reasonably rational fashion, and there are no significant events, it just creates an opportunity for clients and then opportunity therefore for us. Jamie Dimon : It always keep in mind that why they do something probably is more important than what they do. So, if they\u2019re doing it because the American economy is getting stronger, that is more important to be a direct effect of adding -- letting securities mature et cetera. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. I guess just two thoughts on, there\u2019s the impact of QE on the economy and the impact of QE on some of the markets businesses that maybe there has been a crowding out from all the QE, so as they unwind that it could actually boosts activity levels? Jamie Dimon : It could, I just wouldn\u2019t put that in your models. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you for taking my question. Just a couple of questions on consumer. We\u2019ve talked a lot about card losses. But one thing that seems to be a little bit unusual is that a lot of the commentary across many of the card issuers is for the expectations of losses to be higher in the first half than second half. And I just want to get your perspective on the likelihood of that trajectory. Marianne Lake : So, well, I mean -- so, in terms of rates, obviously, the loan balances are seasonally low in the first quarter and charge-off rates are higher in the first quarter. But, overall, we\u2019re not expecting to see abnormal patterns in our charge-offs. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on auto. Your lease a little bit to the impact of declining residual values, which has been of course a focus for the past couple of years. Was there anything unusual in your view about the pace of decline in residual values in this first quarter? Jamie Dimon : Because it happens every 5 or 10 years, so why would anyone be surprised? And we\u2019ve always been very conscious of this and very careful about how we do leases, we do it conservatively\u2026. Marianne Lake : And we only do\u2026 Jamie Dimon : [Multiple speakers] manufactures and we properly account for it, and we have loss mitigation. That\u2019s pretty important. So, no, we\u2019re not surprised it\u2019s going to happen every now and then. Eric Wasserstrom : But in terms of pace of residual values from here, similar or different in your view? Jamie Dimon : I have no idea. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marianne, let me start with the question on the net revenue rate in the card services business. That\u2019s been relatively steady, little over 10% for the last couple of quarters. I presume given your outlook that that would stay pretty close to the 10.1% level that you reported for the last couple of quarters or are you thinking about a change there as you slightly change your marketing strategy? Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s actually got somewhat less to do with our marketing strategy than it has to do with the fantastic success we\u2019ve had with new products, Sapphire Reserve in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year. So, but fundamentally, if you go back, I think to a conference that Kevin Waters spoke at last year sometime in I think September, he said look, we\u2019re going to see the revenue rate be lower, about 10 and some for the couple of quarters, while we acquire all of these accounts. Once we\u2019ve hit a pace, we should see middle out and 10.5 the full year of 2017. So the first quarter lower and subsequent quarters continuing to now start rising back up towards the 11.25% which was ultimate run rate target and that\u2019s still fundamentally what we\u2019re expecting to see, which is, we\u2019re at -- assuming, there are expectations of what we\u2019re going to see an account growth over the future period continues to hold, we would expect to see an increase from here in the second quarter, the overall year to be sort of finish in the mid-10s and end year 11-ish and then goes back to 11.25 over the course of next couple of years. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thank you. Jamie, maybe a question [multiple speakers]. Fair enough. Jamie, a question for you, just another one on the regulatory landscape. There are number of open positions inside the Beltway at a number of the primary bank regulators. And I am just curious in terms -- pardon me? Jamie Dimon : I said I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m kidding. Matt Burnell : Well somebody should fill those spots, if it\u2019s not you. I am just curious what you\u2019re thinking is of the timing of those appointments and how quickly those could get filled and what benefit that might provide to the banking industry. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ve been clear, I think Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin are doing the right thing; they want to find the right people for jobs. They are talking about our data, they are talking about lots of people, but even after they announced it, remember they need to be vetted and confirmed that could take 90 days. So, the sooner, the better, but I think getting the right people is equally important. Operator : And we have no other questions in queue at this time. Marianne Lake : Okay. So, just Glenn, I think you\u2019re still on; I\u2019ve got a couple of numbers for you in terms of retail exposure. Our direct retail exposure in the hotel space is about $20 billion, more than 70% investment grade and more than 15% secured. And in terms of commercial real estate, about $11 billion, largely ABL, pick the right name, structural protection, all the things you talked about. So, not that it\u2019s nothing but it\u2019s in the context of our overall total lending portfolio. It\u2019s not as concentrated I think as you were implying. So, if you want to call Investor Relations and that is not what you were looking at, we can try and reconcile those numbers for you. Okay. Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and you may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand-by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thanks operator and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reports a record net income of $7 billion, EPS of $1.82 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $26.4 billion. Included in the result is a legal benefit of approximately $400 million after tax from a previously announced settlement involving the FDIC's Washington Mutual receivership. Other notable items predominantly net result changes and legal expense were a small net negative this quarter, so underlying adjusted performance was really strong and highlights of the quarter include average core loan growth of 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued growth across products; double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 12%; number one, global IB fees up 10% and we delivered record net income in both Commercial Banking and in Asset & Wealth Management. Moving on to Page 2 and some more details about the quarter, revenues of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion or 5% year-on-year with the increase predominantly in net interest income up approximately $900 million reflecting continued loan growth and the impact of higher rates. Fee revenue was up $300 million year-on-year, but adjusting for one-time items in both years was down modestly. With lower fixed income markets, mortgage and card revenue, all as guided being offset by strong fee revenue growth across remaining businesses. Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was up a little less than $400 million year-on-year with auto leases being the biggest driver, but also increasing the impact of the FDIC surcharge and broader growth being offset by lower compensation. Credit cost of $1.2 billion were down $187 million year-on-year on new reserve build. And a net reserve build in Consumer of a little over $250 million driven by card was offset by a net release in wholesale of a little under $250 million driven by Energy. Anticipating you may have questions given the recent Gas & Oil prices, I would emphasize that we guided to expect reserve releases given we started the year with $1.5 billion of energy related reserves and with oil prices having found a lower but seemingly stable level we feel appropriately reserved. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. You can see in the red circle on the page here that we ended the quarter with binding fully phased in CET 1 12.5% under the standardized approach with the improvement being primarily driven by capital generation offset by net loan growth. We've been hovering around the inflection point under the Collins Floor for a while now and expect standardized to remain our binding constrain from here. Given that, we've replicated this page under standardized rules in the appendix, please read. Balance sheet, risk weighted assets and SLR, all remained relatively flat from the prior quarter and while not on the page, I would also note that we remained compliant with all liquidity requirements. We were pleased to announce growth repurchase capacity of up to $19.4 billion over the next four quarters and the Board announced its intention to increase common stock dividends 12% to $0.56 a share effective in the third quarter. In addition, we recently submitted our 2017 resolution plan which we believe fully addresses outstanding regulatory feedback. Moving on to Page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.2 billion of net income and an ROE of 16.5%. We continue to grow core loans up 9% year-on-year driven by strength in mortgage up 12%, card and business banking were each up 8% and auto loans and leases were also up 8% driven by strong lease performance from our manufacturing partners. Deposit rate continues to be strong up 10% year-on-year with household retention remaining at historically high levels. Before improvement in our deposit margin up 16 basis points. Sales growth in card was very strong again this quarter up 15% as new accounts mature and merchant processing volumes grew double-digits up 12%. Revenue of $11.4 billion was flat year-on-year, but recall that last year included a net benefit of about $200 million principally driven by the Visa Europe gain. So excluding that revenue was up modestly. Consumer & Business banking revenue was up 13% on both strong deposit growth and margin expansion. Mortgage revenue was down 26% and higher rates drove higher funding cost which together with lower MSR risk management and lower production margins the pressure on mortgage revenue year-over-year. In addition, revenue increase and a reduction of approximately $75 million to net interest income related the capitalized interest on modified loans. And card commercialization and auto revenue was down 3%, but if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned was up 2%. With NII growth on higher loan balances and higher auto lease income predominantly offset by the continued impact of investments in card new account acquisitions. Expense of $6.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year on higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense and continued underlying business growth. Finally on credit performance, card services drove higher net charge-offs year-on-year, but still within our guidance for the full year of less than 3%. Net reserve builds were around $250 million building $350 million in card, $50 million in business banking and 25 million in auto, in part due to loan growth and in part higher loss rates in card. This was partially offset by a release of $175 million in mortgage reflecting continued improvement in home prices and lower delinquencies. To touch on consumer delinquency trends in particular in card we were seeing some early signs of normalization which are generally in line with our expectations and our credit risk appetite and in auto our trends are relatively flat. Now turning to Page 5 on the Corporate Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.7 billion on revenue of $8.9 billion and an ROE of 14.5%. In banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 14% year-on-year with strong performance across products and particular strength in DCM. We ranked number one in global IB fees and number one in North America and EMEA. We were also number one in ECM and DCM globally and each case gaining share for the first half of this year. Advisory fees were up 8% benefiting from a large number of deals closing this quarter. Equity underwriting fees were up 29% better than the market, but relative to a weak prior year quarter. With a strong market backdrop and supported valuations we saw continued momentum in global issuance especially IPOs. And debt underwriting fees were up 5% from a strong quarter last year driven by the high flow volume of repricing and refinancing activity even with fewer large acquisition financings. In terms of the outlook, we expect IB fees in the second half of the year to be down year-on-year given that we had the highest IB fees on records for the third quarter last year. That said, overall sentiment remains positive, ECM issuance is expected to continue given the stable market backdrop and the M&A backlog is healthy with conditions remaining constructive for refinancing activities. Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by higher rates as well as operating deposit growth. Lending revenue of $373 million was up 35% reflecting lower mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual lends. Moving on to Markets, total revenue was $4.8 billion down 14% year-on-year. Fixed income revenue was down 19% with decent performance across products relative to a very strong second quarter last year which was driven by higher levels of volatility and activity broadly, including as a result of Brexit. This quarter conversely can be characterized by a lack of idiosyncratic events resulting in sustained low volatility, reduced flows and continued credit spreads tightening, all of which impacted activity levels in rates, credit rating and commodities. Emerging market performance was relatively stronger on a weaker dollar and lower rate as well as some regional events. Equities revenue was down 1%. In derivatives on the structured side we did quite well and outperformed and on the flow end we held our own in a quiet and therefore challenging environment. Prime is a bright spot as we are realizing the benefit of the investments we've been consistently making. Before I move on, I would also like to remind you that the third quarter of 2016 markets revenue was also a record since 2010, in fact it was about a billion dollars more than the average of the previous five years. And so while that is in the guidance it is context as this quarter has felt quiet more like prior years. Securities services revenue of $982 million was up 8% driven by higher rates and higher asset based fees on higher market levels and remember the second quarter benefits from dividend seasonality. Finally expense of $4.8 billion was down 5% year-on-year driven by lower compensation expense and the comp to revenue ration for the quarter was 28%. Moving on to Page 6 and Commercial Banking. Another quarter of excellent performance with record revenue and net income and an ROE of 17%. Revenue grew 15% driven by the deposit NII as the rate environment continues to be favorable and on higher loan balances with spreads remaining steady. IB revenue was down due to the lack of large deal activity during the quarter, but underlying flow activity was solid across products as momentum continued and forwards pipelines appeared strong. Expense of $790 million was up 8% and we expect this to grow moderately in the second half as we continue to execute on the investments in bankers and technology that we outlined at investor day. Loan balances were up 12% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 4% sequentially ahead of the industry on broad based growth across market and within specialized industries. CRE showed growth of 2% in line with the industry but below last year's pace on reduced origination activity as we continue to be selective at this stage in the cycle. Finally, credit performance remained very strong with a net charge-off rate of 2 basis points. Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported record net income of $624 million with pretax margin of 32% and an ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels but also strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 4% year-on-year driven by a combination of higher external fees and compensation on higher revenue. This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $9 billion with positive flows across multi-assets, fixed income and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We saw net liquidity outflows of $7 billion largely due to the Pacific client deal related cash needs. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.6 trillion were both up 11% year-on-year on high market levels. Deposits were flat year-on-year and down 5% sequentially reflecting the beginning of balance migration into investment related assets as expected and those balances remained with us. Finally, loan balances were up 9% year-over-year driven by mortgage up nearly 20%. Moving on to Page 8 and Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $570 million which includes the legal benefit I mentioned earlier of $645 million in revenue or $400 million after tax. And a reminder, this is the same $645 million that was publicly announced in August 2016 and represents partial reimbursement for costs that we previously incurred and paid that remained the responsibility of the WaMu receivership. Finally turn to Page 9 and the Outlook. Starting with the quarter we guided second quarter NII to be up about $400 million from the third quarter given the rate hike, but you'll see that the NII deposits increased by only $150 million while we did fully realize the expected benefit of higher rate and continued growth, against that we had the one-time $75 million mortgage adjustment as well as lower CIB markets NII. These effects together with modest downward pressure from lower tenure rate with all other things equal point to a full year number of closer to $4 billion up, while this is in the previous 4.5, but with the potential to be higher if we continue to benefit from tailwinds of lower deposit re-price. So you will see, we have adjusted the guidance on the page, but it will be market dependent and any near-term forecast is sensitive to a number of factors none of which changes our conviction that we will ultimately deliver $11 billion plus of incremental NII as rates normalize and we are well on our way. On expense, we continue to expect full year adjusted expense of $58 billion. Second quarter was in line with our expectations and our guidance as a little better than $14.5 billion which is also where we expect the third quarter to come in. Finally, we have revised our full year core loan growth down to 8% year-over-year with a couple of comments. First, we are seeing slightly lower growth than we expected, coming into the year, it is only modestly lower and more importantly, we remain encouraged by the consistency and breadth of client demand across products. Secondly, we noted that mortgage could be a big driver and with a smaller market and a more competitive environment fewer loans have met our hurdle rate. And of course we remain appropriately focused on quality and not quantity of growth and as such loan growth is an outcome, not target. So to wrap up, we are very pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing broad strength. We maintained or improved leadership positions and are delivering the benefits to both clients and shareholders of our operating model and our continued investments. We remain encouraged by the growth outlook for the global economy and expect continued solid growth here in the U.S., which positions us well going forward. And with that operator, you can open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Audio Gap] Line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. How are you? Marianne Lake : Good. Glenn Schorr : During the quarter that Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U.S. balance sheet, and I'm just curious, it's supposed to be slow and deliver, but I'm curious, how you think that impacts liquidity, the yield curve, trading, that participates in and is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan against those disruptions? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would just stop for a second to just point out what Jamie actually said was, this is uncharted territory. It\u2019s not something that we've seen before and so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable things can change and we should be prepared for that, not to say that that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan, but that that would just be a downside risk, not a probability. So on the balance sheet, it is still the case that we expect to start seeing normalization in the balance sheet, in September, if not in September by the end of this year with the actually calling for the next rate hike in December the market is calling for March of next year. And as we said the communication has been pretty consistent and pretty clear across the Fed space, which is to say that is mostly price into the market at this as far as we can tell. And so based upon what we've understood moving we could, we would see the balance sheet shrink about $1.5 trillion over about the next four years. So that would ultimately slow growth not stock price and if we saw a $1.5 trillion come out of the Fed's balance sheet empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see dollar for dollar reduction in deposits. So if you just pick a point between 500 and a $1 trillion of deposit outflows at our 10% market share that would be about $75 billion over full-year. So it would slow growth. It would not stop growth and it is what we've been expecting and what we've been talking about now for an extended period and gradual is good enough. In respect of which deposits we would like to see, so that's the sort of growth scenario. In terms of liquidity, again evidence would suggest and we\u2019ve been communicating this quite clearly that we think preponderance of that deposit outflow would be wholesale deposits and that would be non-operating deposits and those are deposits we ascribe little to no liquidity value to. And so assuming that we're close to right, we would see those deposits ultimately leave the system, but it wouldn't affect materially if at all our liquidity position. So ultimately the yield curve has priced I think all of this in. What I think the Fed has been clear about is that they expect the balance sheet or hope the balance sheet to be in the background and to use short rate as their primary monetary policy tool and so as a result, we would ultimately expect to see perhaps the flattening yield curve, but with the front end ultimately putting the long end up and you heard the Chair Yellen talk about being conscious of the shape of the curve as they go about normalization. I think you may have asked something else, did I missed anything? Glenn Schorr : No that was absolutely awesome. I do have one tiny follow up. You always get a little more than you wanted. Thank you. The one tiny followup Marianne is I just want to make clear that the whole $4 billion versus $4.5 billion and you spelled out what happened in the quarter, it sounded like most of that full year guidance happened in this second quarter, but I just want to clarify that in terms of the second half NII, but do you think it's overly different from where we were a quarter ago? Marianne Lake : No that\u2019s correct. We saw that compared to $400 million expectation, we were up $150 million, so it would be fair to say that most of it was in this quarter. We had also - when we gave the last guidance of 4.5, we pointed out the tenure was low and that that was ultimately pressuring that 4.5, so it really isn't that significant of a change. The only thing I would caution you to remember is that when we think about asset sensitivity, we think about NII, market NII which we wouldn't consider to be in a traditional sense cool, can exhibit volatility geographically with NIR. If you think about a market making business where we can have assets altering of NII hedged by derivatives that ultimately have enough to NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers, so there could be a little noise in there, but no I'm not expecting there to be significant changes. But I think what this - what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished and chasing our tails re-forecasting the full year NII every three quarters isn\u2019t as important or every quarter isn\u2019t as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed, we are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important. Operator : And your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi good morning, Marianne. So thanks for that clarity on the trading related NII. I wanted to follow up on the loan yield side, which were not much moves and you mentioned the $75 million in mortgage. Can you just help us walk through the loan portfolio and whether you're seeing the assets move and whether there is a lag or whether there's any spread compression underneath that? Marianne Lake : Yes so, I understand why you\u2019re asking. If you look at the loan yields relatively flat or even slightly down, if you adjust for the mortgage it would be flat, if you decompose them into wholesale versus retail, we are absolutely seeing all of the yield improvement on the wholesale side about 10-ish basis points. And on the consumer side at this with respect to this quarter, there was some mix impacts in the card business as we saw higher level of transactions and still feel the sting. So it\u2019s not to say that the loan yields aren\u2019t moving in line with our expectations and they are, but mix will matter for any one quarter. Ken Usdin : Okay. So would that naturally say that as we go forward that should, if they're moving the right way mix adjusted they should kind of move the right way from here? Marianne Lake : Yes that\u2019s right and if you look back last quarter they did too. Ken Usdin : Yes. Marianne Lake : Which is that we have a couple of opposing things going on this quarter. Ken Usdin : Understood, okay and then my second question is, it was nice to see the card revenues on the fee side and the revenue capture rate moves towards the way you've been saying, it actually eclipsed the 10.5 you had said for the year already. Can you just help us understand like how we turn the corner then on card income and your expectations for that going forward? Thanks. Marianne Lake : Yes. So obviously one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts. And so the end of third quarter, but importantly both the fourth quarter and the first quarter were extraordinary in terms of the number of accounts we acquired and of course we amortized or contra revenue out those expenses over one year. So at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately will lap that impact a year from now and will see our revenue rates that are improving from here towards 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term and we expect to get to that point all other things being equal kind of mid next year. And of course that is one facet, we\u2019re also seeing significant momentum on the sales front, obviously as a result of those accounts we're growing core loans 8% and so we're having higher NII on those balances. So there's a lot of dry powder. We just need to get past these account acquisition costs, which we will. And I was still compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers, their characteristic, their engagement, their spend, these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them and we intend to deepen relationships with them. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Hey two questions, one on M&A strategy, there was some discussion that maybe you were interested in acquiring something that's not really the question to comment on that specific rumor, but more in this regulatory environment and the changes that we've had already, do you feel like there is a little more flexibility for your strategic actions or outlook than maybe a year ago? Marianne Lake : So I would characterize our strategy as unchanged. We've always been pretty consistent over an extended period that we would prioritize first and foremost strategic investments for growth in our businesses be that organic or otherwise. And obviously you've seen us reinvesting, whether it's in growing loans or introducing new products, hiring bankers, opening offices in our expansion markets and the like. But yes, it's been heavily skewed to being organic over the most recent while. We've also been pretty clear and active I would say in terms of partnering with, investing in, collaborating with partners that can accelerate our growth potential. So we would always be interested, whether that's FinTech or otherwise in getting capabilities that allow us to accelerate to our growth potential. We don't have big gaps, but we would always be interested in that. Having said that, I'm not going to comment on the size of the regulatory environment except to say you should expect for any of these events or transactions will have the appropriate regulators that we have conversation with regulators at the appropriate time. Betsy Graseck : Second question is on a little bit of a ticky-tacky but on FASB. They're working on changing some of the hedge accounting rules and I wondered how you're thinking about areas in your balance sheet. You might be able to utilize that in a way that makes your business more efficient, I don't know if that's something that you're thinking about? Marianne Lake : Yes, so obviously we are supportive of the new hedge accounting rules and it will allow us to consider taking advantage of hedge accounting a wider set of products than we currently do, but we actually have reasonably limited hedge in effect in our P&L right now. So from a practical perspective, it won\u2019t make a big difference to the business, but it is more flexibility in terms of the scope and we\u2019re looking at that. Jamie Dimon : I would just add as a policy matter, we make economic decisions not accounting decisions. So accounting is a fiction and as Marianne spoke about the credit card, you expensed the acquisition cost over 12 months, the benefit comes over seven years. So we make huge investments all the time based on economics. We will never make a decision based upon accounting and then we'll describe it to our shareholders to understand why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. Betsy Graseck : Right. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, Marianne. I wanted to ask about the credit cards, the outlook for charge-offs remains the same at about below 3% for the year and you are about 3% now in the first half. So maybe you're expecting a little bit of improvement in the back half of the year, is that seasonal? Marianne Lake : Yes, it\u2019s seasonality. So you see in the first half around that guidance level, we would expect that to go down slightly from seasonality in the second half or full year a bit below 3. John McDonald : And then at Investor Day, the outlook for the medium-term was not much higher 3 to 3.25, does that allow for the seasoning over the next year or two of all the growth that you've had and allow for some normalization too, is that enough cushion to get all that in there? Marianne Lake : So, I would say obviously any time you reach an inflection point you need to be cautious about understanding the pace of change for at least for 2018 3 to 3.5 feels right. I think when you get beyond that we'll be updating you with our views as we experience that more in reality, it doesn't feel significantly different from that. But I think 2018 is a good number and 2019 we'll update you. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. I just wanted to follow up to the questions that Glenn and Ken had on margin. Marianne, could you give us a little bit of insight on how deposit rate has trended wholesale versus retail during the quarter? And also just going back to your comments, if the Fed balance sheet reduction drives wholesale deposits out of the system, can we assume that, that should not affect deposit rate negatively for JPMorgan? Marianne Lake : Yes, okay. So just talk about what we've seen so far I think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle. It is a tale of two cities. We said this quarter, the wholesale price necessarily experiences higher reprice more quickly and we are seeing that pretty much in line with our expectations. It matches; you need to get granular, the type of deposits that planned segmentation it matches, so in wholesale price we are seeing it, we\u2019re on that journey. In the retail space we haven't seen that yet. So while there have been small changes in the industry in CDs there is nothing in checking or savings, but again I'll just point out to you that we wouldn\u2019t have expected that to be disciplined yet in the cycle. And I would say with respect to deposit basis and the Fed balance sheet if we are right and we believe will be close to right and that we see the wholesale non-operating deposits flowing out of the system assuming everybody else has reached the same conclusion then it shouldn\u2019t really materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions. And if you couple that with the expectation of a very gradual and measured pace which gives people a lot of time and opportunity to plan accordingly, we wouldn't expect there to be a significant impact on basis if any. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And my second question, you mentioned in the beginning of the call that standardized will ultimately be your CET 1 binding constraints. And I'm wondering if you were allowed to flowed off your current off risk floor and I think it\u2019s a $400 billion. Does that mean standardize is your constraint that being able to floor it off the floor and model out your off risk, may not be an incremental source of capital because standardized is binding? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would say, first of all I would say focusing on any one, so we will be very supportive of changes to how operation of the capital is treated under rate capital rules, but I think focusing on one facet and not the whole thing is unlikely to be the only one thing changes. So we'd like to see changes made over time, but for the foreseeable future as we are growing our loans quite strongly and these are extraordinarily high quality loans where the differential between advanced and standardized is quite big, we still expect standardized to bind us. Jamie Dimon : And I should point out the standardized were 100% in United States, in Europe we're talking about 75%. So there will be some changes over time in how well these capital ratios get calculated for international competitiveness reasons. Marianne Lake : Yes, so whether it's because the operational risk will change or whether it\u2019s because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive there should be changes over time, but I think for the foreseeable future this is what we expect. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. First question is on Commercial Banking, can you just comment a bit on the sustainability of the growth in profitability, you've had this your earnings are up 30% year-on-year, loan growth C&I 9%, CRE up 15% and we're not talking about small numbers anymore. I think your loan book now is about $200 billion in commercial banking and can you just talk about some of the initiatives that you've discussed that the middle market the BIB, and how sustainable that is, and whether, how whether you're comfortable with the risk profile of the book you have there because you are growing quickly? It is a big book now and you're certainly growing faster than the industry. Marianne Lake : Yes, so I would, I will start with if you go back a couple of years ago 2013, 2014, 2015 when we were doing our business simplification agenda and derisking and uplifting the controlled environment in the Commercial Bank was blocking and tackling and doing a lot. We were really focused and we talked, I think all the way back in 2015 that there were outbound calls, opening offices, hiring bankers and if you waited a minute you'd see that come into our results and this is sort of fruits of that labor. So I do think it is sustainable. There's nothing in these results that is particularly noisy outside of reserve releases, which I'll come back to. I would also say the partnership between the Commercial Bank and the IB in terms of covering our clients, the introduction of 16 specialized industries, which is an advantage we can bring to our clients nationally and in fact globally the other competitors can\u2019t bring, all of those things sets us up for continued solid growth. With respect to loan growth, I would say if you look at our C&I loans this quarter as an example was pretty broad based. There wasn't a specific in the middle market that wasn't a specific industry or market segment that was strong, but over the last - stronger, I should say, but over the last few years, a lot of our growth has been driven by the investments we've been making in the expansion markets.  So we got into the new markets with the WaMu acquisition. We continue to build out those markets, add bankers, open offices and that has been a source of growth for us that perhaps others haven't been able to enjoy and also, as I said, specialized industry and then\u2026 Jamie Dimon : That is what we said, I think we're in all major 50 markets now unlike retail or one day we will embark an expansion in cities we're not in and the products set is just fabulous. We're adding more and more online things. We're adding simpler and faster credit approvals. We're adding, making it easier to do merchant processing when you sign up for middle market loans. The online systems are great. So all that stuff I think this is going to grow over a long period of time. And thanks for pointing out how well it did. I hope that you are listening congratulations. Saul Martinez : Yes, no problem. Marianne Lake : The only thing I would say on commercial real estate just because I think it's really important is, commercial real estate it depends what you do and more than half of our commercial real estate closure is commercial term lending. It's a very specific strategy. We don\u2019t deviate from that strategy and I would just point you because it was interesting to me, if you look at the Feds CCAR stress results the commercial real estate across the industry and look at how our results compared to others, I think you can hopefully get somewhat more comfortable and we are very comfortable with what we have right now. Now that said, the [indiscernible] did benefit from reserve releases and benign credit and at some point there will be a cycle, but the risk appetite we have in the way we have managed with discipline, we are very happy with that. Jamie Dimon : And the IB, brining JPMorgan investment banking to Chase corporate clients we still think there's a long way to go. Saul Martinez : That\u2019s great. Thank you. If I can follow up with a bigger picture question and Jamie, you've been, correct me if I'm wrong, you've been pretty vocal about believing that the underpinnings of our economy are healthy and strong and not buying into the whole secular stagnation argument, but at what point does political dysfunction and political paralysis really start to dent that confidence and because you've also indicated that we do need structural reform to lift trend growth, whether it's infrastructure cash from whatever it is, and can you just comment on that? And I guess, as an adjunct to that, what are your conversations with clients like, is there a risk that is materializing that clients are also starting to become more frustrated with the lack of progress politically? Jamie Dimon : I would look at it the other way around. So we've - since the great recession okay, which is now eight years old, we've been growing 1.5% to 2% in spite of stupidity and political gridlock because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless. From to wake up in the morning, the want to feed their kids, they want to buy a home, they want to do things. It's the same with American businesses, might what I'm saying is that it will be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and we were not gridlocked. And thank you for pointed it out because I'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. We are unable to build bridges, we're unable to build airports or industries. School kids are not graduating. You know, I was just in France. I was recently in Argentina. I was in Israel, I was in Ireland. We met with the Prime Minister of India and China. It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that promote business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and it's somehow this great American free enterprises and we no longer get it. And so, my view is that and corporate taxation is critical to that by the way. We've been driving capital and bringing it overseas, which is why this $2 trillion sitting overseas benefiting all these other countries and stuff like that. So if we don't get it, if we don't get our act together we could still grow, obviously it\u2019s unfortunate but it\u2019s hurting us. It\u2019s hurting the body of politics, it\u2019s hurting the average American that we don't have these right policies and so no, in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1.5% to 2%. I don\u2019t buy the argument that we'll relegate this forever, we\u2019re not. And you know if this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure regulatory reform we have become the most one of most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet. It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen travelling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country. And you know at one point we all have to get our act together or we will do what we're supposed to do to the average Americans. And unfortunately people write about the things like it\u2019s for corporations. It\u2019s not for corporations, competitive taxes are important for business and business growth, which is important for jobs and wage growth. And honestly, we should be winging that along, but every single one of you every time you talk to clients. Marianne Lake : And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the dialogue is going, whether you look at middle market, you Corporate Banking, M&A it\u2019s not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impacts that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they are fundamentally really just getting on with things and services. The client has a compelling strategic deal to be done or some spending or hiring or growth then they are pretty much getting on with it, which is why we\u2019re seeing solid growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: You guys obviously had a very big approval for share buybacks on the latest CCAR here and I just wanted your thoughts on terms of using it all given where your stock price is, given loan growth has slowed a tad and given the flatter yield curve mix buying securities is less interesting, how do you put that all together? Marianne Lake : Yes. So look, obviously you know the deal with CCAR people which is capacity is not necessarily a commitment to utilize it although we are as we fairly clearly articulated at our Investor Day and as you see in the numbers here, that we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET 1 and we believe we ought to be able to over time operate the company lower than that within the range of 11% to 12.5% albeit that we will take time to do that. So we're in the market buying our stock every day, you know we're at 1.8 times value you saw in gaining shareholder assets. We still think that there is significant value in the stock. We believe in the earnings power and the franchise that we have here. And so not to say that we would utilize all the capacity because other things can come up, but we've put in the request based upon our desire to want to ultimately move lower. Jamie Dimon : Yes and this is very important policy issues here too. So our preference is always to build organically, to not buyback stock, but to build branches and grow and lend more. But there's an argument that people are making that banks can't lend it and even if there is excess lending capabilities, they wouldn\u2019t have done it and that is not true. The counterfactual would have been that if banks can freely use their capital and their liquidity five years ago, they would have been a lot more lenient in the system. And that we pointed out two areas where it would have taken place, one is mortgages where regulators have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, buyer defaults, et cetera and the second is small business, whereas it\u2019s not existing small businesses, think of the start-up small businesses and that they are having a hard time getting capital maybe at community bank level et cetera. The counterfactual would have been that $1 trillion or $2 trillion would have been lent out had these rules been changed five years ago. That is the counterfactual. It\u2019s not that, well the banks wouldn\u2019t have lent the money. And so again, there is a false notion that all this didn\u2019t hold back the economy, yes it did. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning Marianne. Marianne Lake : Good morning, how are you? Gerard Cassidy : Good. Can you give us some color Federal Reserve Chairwomen Yellen indicated that she sees that there could be some relief on the horizon for the banks and one of the areas that's been talked about is change in the calculation of the SLR. If you guys modelled out what that could do to your SLR and then how that may change your view on capital going forward, if there are changes where for example, they take the cash sitting that's sitting at the central banks out of the equation? Marianne Lake : Yes. So obviously, they haven't been specific although the Treasury report had some ideas. They haven\u2019t been specific about what the calibration would look like and whether there would be recalibration to the numeric and the denominator or one or the other. Clearly, we've been pretty clear that we think cash at central banks shouldn't necessarily be included and there are other things, different people have different opinions, so we've done the calculations. I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now of which leveraging a variety of forms is part of that, so to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact on the margin, but we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company. So we\u2019re being as social as we can. We're not specifically leverage constrained right now that doesn't mean we're not supportive of making those changes and we will obviously model it out. But we take the potential for those changes into consideration when we think about the direction we grow our businesses. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a followup, coming back to credit cards, obviously the Sapphire has been a huge success in growing your business there. The acquisition costs higher today than when you compare them to maybe two or three years ago and in that vein, when you guys look at the economics of putting on new cards is the net present value or whatever measure you use to determine the economics has that improved, stayed the same or weakened from maybe a year or two ago? Marianne Lake : So I think, I want to point out something because I know the Sapphire reserve gets a significant amount of attention for obvious and good reasons, but it is only one product in a platform of successful products both proprietary and co-brand. And so in reality, while we obviously do all the modeling and the math it is not about what the cost of any one individual card acquired is or the NPV about how the portfolios ultimately together could perform over time and it's still very early on Sapphire reserve. I mean it\u2019s not even a year old yet and these are portfolios and products that develop and season over time and as I said these are extraordinary good customer relationships. So you know, we've done a bunch of things in the card business over the last few years. We've renegotiated our co-brands that was ultimately with lower economics, but still very good economics. We\u2019ve been out on the front foot issuing new products, not just Sapphire reserve, but Freedom Unlimited, the Amazon Prime Card, Inc. And so we think about everything in the total portfolio and its collective performance over time and its still generating very good returns. Jamie Dimon : I just mentioned about the regulatory SLRs, so looking at it very broadly, if you look at - it's not just capital liquidity but mortgage rules, requirements, capital liquidity collateral rules, where collateral can be used and not used. If these things were just calibrated differently, the cost of credit will go down, swap prices go down, mortgage will become more available, the cost of mortgage will come down and those are kind of important in total if they\u2019re done right and without changing at all the rest of the system in fact the system is healthier, if the economy is healthier. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Chubak of Nomura Instinet. Steve Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Marianne, I wanted to start off with sort of with a question on liquidity. You spoke of how the Fed balance sheet unwind should have little impact on your LCR, but just given the strength of your liquidity position and the significant excess reserves that you have at the Fed how should we be thinking about the current capacity to deploy some of that excess into higher yielding MBS and maybe what is your appetite to redeploy just given some of the tougher liquidity treatment for Agency MBS in particular? Marianne Lake : So when we think about the liquidity position of this company we\u2019re obviously managing not just regulatory requirements but also to what we will ultimate duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycles. So if you take into consideration not just the amount of liquidity we have and how that could be utilized, but also the mortgage portfolio, we have agency MBS. So all of that goes into our determination and we will continue to add to duration opportunistically when it makes sense to do it and manage our balance sheet with discipline. Steve Chubak : Okay, understood. And then just one more question from me, just on capital targets. I appreciate all the detail Marianne you provided indicating that over time there could be a path or trajectory towards getting to the lower end of that 11% to 12.5% range. I'm just wondering, given the very favorable CCAR results we saw this year coupled with some of the Treasury reforms have been outlined, is there the potential for you to actually manage to a target even below that 11% especially if gold-plating surcharges impact goes away? Marianne Lake : Yes so I would, I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or the next two cycles of CCAR and so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get below into the range, but operate for the short to medium term within the range, while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment with large play out. And so, as to whether or not over time there is a sort of recalibration of whether 11% is on minimum that will play out over time. So for the next one or two cycles of CCAR this cycle and the next one I would just expect that we want to be on a measured pace to be within the range to allow us to better understand all of the changes that will take place over time and make appropriate decisions. I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes, I think we would want to operate with sufficiency of capital and liquidity. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Lim of SocGen. Andrew Lim : Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just coming back to the Treasury's proposals for the new calculation of the SLR can you give any color as to whether that's actually even possible within the glib context as to how the Basel Committee and wouldn\u2019t want harmonization across the whole world. And of course if it did happen, then you\u2019d have a massive advantage along with other U.S. banks versus other European investment banks. Marianne Lake : So I would say of course it is possible. We've seen a number of situations where implementing global standards in the U.S. have deferred in meaningful ways from how they've been implemented elsewhere. You have rarely seen that B2B advantage of the U.S. and the SLR is no exception. So while that maybe recalibrations of either the numerator or denominator, you know, know that to the European 3% standard are current depositary institutions are held with 6% standard. So there's plenty of room for there to be adjustments before it would create an unlevel playing field. And my suspicion is there would also be adjustments elsewhere and it's supposed to be as I think Jamie Dimon said a backdrop not binding in the way that it has become. So I think the answer is yes, but we will see. Jamie Dimon : Okay, the key point Marianne said is almost every single thing that's been done in America added to Basel requirements, the gold plating, SLR, calculation of LCR, calculation of stress, GSIB, almost every single thing. And remember America doesn't have to listen to Basel either, and you may, we may have noticed that basically France, Germany, India, China, all time Basel they better take a deep breath and stop doing it more with what they\u2019re doing. Andrew Lim : Great, thanks. And just a followup question also on the reduction in the Op risk and I mean you talked about advances for standardized funds, I mean, looking at the CCAR your SLRs are binding constraint that isn\u2019t that really a moot argument, a none argument really as to whether that happens or not, i.e. if you reduce your Op risk it doesn't really change your excess capital? Marianne Lake : So, look there are a number of different people talking about the forward-looking standard for operational risk, Basel under Basel\u2019s 3.5 or 4 or whatever is talking about there were some proposals in the choice act. So there's no question that there should be a re-visitation of the mechanisms to calculate operational risk and then you're right, the way that all of these will ultimately interplay with each other matters and so from a pure stress test perspective, at the margin, we had a little bit more binding constraint on leverage than CET 1. But if you look at just what, what we could run the company at if CCAR was the only constraint it would be lower than where we are. So, it's a complicated dynamic of trying to make sure that we are maximizing against all of these constraints and not just the mathematical ones, but also the operational and practical ones. So I mean, it\u2019s necessary to go back and rethink the calculation of operational risk just because it's the right thing to do and ultimately how that plays out into how we optimize against our constraint is less of what we focus on. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Oh hey, just two other quick things, one on the accounting with hedged just to get back on it will affect the question also was, was there any opportunity for your clients too because if there is an opportunity for say institutions to hedge their books of business more that could feed into your revenues? Marianne Lake : I wouldn't imagine. It is not going to change our risk management strategy in a meaningful way, so, I would imagine it would be... Jamie Dimon : The [indiscernible] corporations. The new hedging rules will affect other corporate or non-banks. Betsy Graseck : Yes, in the sense that you can potentially hedge your commodity risk, so wouldn\u2019t that be something? Jamie Dimon : We haven't looked at whether it creates more demand from the corporate sides, we'll look at that Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay. And then, is there a timeframe here where you have to start telling us what your LCR is? I wasn't sure if that was coming up soon was that this quarter or next quarter or is just been put on hold? Marianne Lake : No, it is still this quarter and there are requirements to make public disclosures in August, so depending on whether you make them in your Q, in your pillar 3 or not will determine whether it's the beginning or middle or end of August. We as you know have as an industry being quite public about the fact that we think - by the way we provide an extraordinary amount of real time granular, same day granular information on the liquidity [indiscernible] in order for them to be able to properly supervise not just after the system. And so, we believe the regulators do have and can have anything they need when they need it. It's just a question about whether there is any added benefit of those information being made public, near real-time. While it wouldn't matter today, when everyone is running very significant liquidity surpluses it could have unintended consequences if we\u2019re in an environment that was more stressful than we are today. So, right now the requirement is that we have to disclose, I suspect although we've asked for a delay as an industry that we might have to disclose, we will continue to debate, I think with regulators the merits of those public disclosures over time. Betsy Graseck : I guess that, I'm just thinking that there is the opportunity to show us the non-operating deposits going away, which would help people understand the strength of deposit franchise? Marianne Lake : Yes and I mean, I would suggest although it's not something we tell you every quarter that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least Investor Day now and then between operating and non-operating deposits and as we start to see the impact of the Fed balance sheet unwind in the light, we will \u2013 we will be very forthcoming. We tried to be incredibly transparent and we will take that under advisement regardless of what the regulatory disclosures are about the quality of our deposit franchise. But we have I think periodically been more to disclosed this than most in terms of the quality of our deposits. Jamie Dimon : You could see that we have $500 billion of cash, $300 billion of securities, $300 billion of repo, I mean this is a pretty liquid company. The liquid is any bank I have ever seen on this planet. Marianne Lake : And we have moved $200 billion of non-operating deposits proactively, so we manage it very carefully. Jamie Dimon : Yes there is nothing, what happened because of all this reflects JPMorgan much and the very important LCR is not, it doesn't affect us. We're fine disclosing whether they want to disclose. It's an issue of whether the monetary, whether it is good for monetary policy and will it cause a problem, not for us, for the system when there's a crisis. Like do they want banks to use the liquidity or not, very simple because the answer is you've got to maintain over 100% then you can\u2019t use your liquidity that's what it means. And so, they said publicly, some have said there is quite legal below 100 and we're saying well, what bank is going to be the first to go 100. And so it\u2019s kind of a policy issue. Whatever happens, we're completely fine at JPMorgan. If I were the regulators, I wouldn't want to put myself in that kind of a position. Operator : And we have no further questions. A - Marianne Lake : Thank you. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JP Morgan Chase\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JP Morgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. The third quarter was generally constructive across businesses and asset classes. Underlying business drivers grew broadly and we maintained or gained share in a competitive environment. The U.S. and global economy continue to grow. Clients are active with demand for credit remaining solid, all in all resulting in 7% growth in net income driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled. On an adjusted basis, this is a clear record for a third quarter. Of course, against this financial backdrop I want to acknowledge the recent natural disasters. The impact on affected customers, communities and employees has been devastating, and supporting them is our priority as we rebuild. I will note that any financial impact is not significant to our results. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $26.2 billion. Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 7.5% year-on-year, and the FDIC recently released its survey showing that the firm has surpassed the competition and now ranks number 1 in total U.S. deposits and in deposit growth, driven by strong consumer deposit growth up 9%. Client investment assets, credit card sales and merchant volumes were all up 13%, and we continue to rank number one in global IDCs. We had record revenue in the commercial bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in assets and wealth management. The credit environment continues to remain benign across products and portfolios. Card charge-offs were fully in line with our expectations and guidance, and outside of card our charge-off rates remain at historically low levels.  Now turning to Page 2 and some more detail about the third quarter. Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year driven by net interest income up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue. Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was flat to last quarter and to last year if you exclude $175 million of one-time items in CCB in the prior year period. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up about $200 million year-on-year driven by higher net charge-offs in card, and in the quarter we built card reserves of $300 million primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages. We saw a wholesale release of over $100 million partially driven by select names in the energy sector and reflecting improvements in portfolio quality in commercial real estate. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3, what is most notable on this page is that all of the numbers are basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the exception of growth in tangible book value per share, as capital generation was fully offset by distributions, reflecting a payout of above 100% for the first time in a long time, in line with our previous capital plan. From here, we expect the direction of travel for our CET 1 ratio to be lower over time. Moving on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking, CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continue to grow core loans up 8% year-on-year driven by mortgage up 12% and business banking, card and auto loans and leases were each up 7%. Year-on-year, we saw 13% growth in each of client investment assets, card sales and merchant processing volumes. Nearly half of the growth in investment assets came from net inflows and our deposit margin continued to expand, up 6 basis points this quarter. Revenue of $12 billion was up 6% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Mortgage revenue was down 17% on loan spread and production margin compression as well as lower net servicing revenue driven by the MSR. Underlying that decline, the mortgage business is performing well relative to the market. Our originations are down only 1% versus the market down an estimated 15% as we gain share and purchase. Finishing up on revenue, card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up 7% as higher auto lease income and growth in card loan balances outpaced the continued impact of investments in new account acquisitions. Expect CCSA fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve last year.  Expense of $6.5 billion was flat year-on-year or up 3% excluding the one-time items I mentioned. Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth were partially offset by lower marketing expense. The overhead ratio was 54% for the quarter as positive operating leverage despite significant investment in the business moves us closer to our medium term target. Finally on credit performance, in terms of net charge-offs, as I said, card increased in line with expectations and guidance, and in auto charge-offs included approximately $50 million of a catch-up reflecting regulatory guidance on the treatment of customer bankruptcies. Excluding this, the loss rate in auto was only 41 basis points. In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels with inventory, incentives, used car prices and SAW all having stabilized over the last few months. In terms of credit reserves, are previously mentioned, we built $300 million in card reserves in the quarter as we grow, and although there were no mortgage reserve actions, portfolio quality improvements allowed us to absorb the expected impact of the hurricanes into our current reserves. Now turning to Page 5 and the corporate and investment bank, CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. The third quarter of 2016 revenue in both IBCs and markets benefited from a number of (indiscernible) events and higher levels of volatility, creating tough comparisons across the board. This quarter in banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was strong and relatively flat from last year\u2019s record levels. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve gained some share and maintained our number one ranking in global IBCs. We also rank number one in North America and EMEA.  We printed record advisory fees for third quarter, up 14% on broad strength across sectors and deal sizes particularly in Europe, making up for a smaller wallet in North America. Equity underwriting fees were down 21%; however, we rank number one in wallet, number of deals and volumes globally for the quarter and for the year to date. The market remains active and the pipeline healthy. In debt underwriting, there was a reasonably high run rate coming into the quarter and we broadly maintained it, landing fees slightly down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by strong re-pricing and refinancing activity and high yield bond issuance. We rank number one in fees year-to-date and gained share overall and across products.  Treasury services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%, and while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments we\u2019ve made in our platform and products. Moving on to markets, total revenue was $4.5 billion, down 21% year-on-year against an impressive third quarter of 2017 in a quieter and very competitive environment. Fixed income revenue was down 27%, a solid performance given a backdrop of low volatility and tight spreads. At the risk of laboring the point, you may recall that we gained 240 basis points of share in FIC in the third quarter of \u201916, which will mean our year-on-year decline will look larger than most. Equities revenue was down 4% but underneath that is a diversification story. Consistent with last quarter, lower flow and exotic derivatives activity was substantially offset by strength in cash and prime, which continues to be a bright spot throughout this year. Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third with no obvious catalysts on the horizon for that to change, but of course change it could, so it\u2019s worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record for a fourth quarter since the crisis and as such, we expect next quarter\u2019s markets revenues to be lower year-on-year.  Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 10% driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally. Finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year driven by lower compensation expense on lower revenues, and the comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%.  Moving to commercial banking on Page 6, another excellent quarter in this business with net income of $881 million with record revenue and an ROE of 17%, and although we recognize that our results are flattered by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based and is driven by the investments we\u2019ve been making in the business, the differentiated path on capabilities we can offer our clients, and our commitment to business discipline.  Revenue grew 15% year-on-year driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances with overall spreads remaining steady, and while IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially with particular strength in middle market, which is starting to feel like a trend. Expense of $800 million was up 7% on continued investment in the business focused on technology as well as banker coverage, having added over 200 bankers since the beginning of 2016; and since our investment agenda is ongoing, expect fourth quarter expenses to remain at about this level. Loan balances were up 10% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 8% year-on-year driven by strength in expansion markets and specialized industries, but were flat sequentially in line with the industry on flat utilization despite decent deal flow and stable pipelines. Commercial real estate saw growth of 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, and although growth rates are decelerating, we continued to outpace the industry; however, we remain very disciplined in client selection, products and pricing, and are sticking to what we know well. Finally, credit costs were a benefit of $47 million, predominantly driven by commercial real estate. Credit performance remains strong with the net charge-off rate of 4 basis points.  Leaving the commercial bank and moving onto asset and wealth management on Page 7, asset and wealth management reported record net income of $674 million with pre-tax margin of 33% and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII. Expense of $2.2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by a combination of higher compensation and higher external fees for which there is an offset in revenue.  This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $21 billion with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products. We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continued to increase our global market share. Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively year-on-year on higher market levels globally, as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting continued migration from deposit accounts into investment-related assets as we are retaining the vast majority of these balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 10% year-on-year driven by mortgage up 19%.  Moving to Page 8 and corporate, corporate posted net income of $78 million, treasury and CIO\u2019s results improved year-on-year primarily due to the benefit of higher rates, and you\u2019ll remember that last quarter other corporate included a legal benefit which is driving the quarter-on-quarter decline you see on the page. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook, all of NII, expense, charge-off and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance, so to wrap up, this quarter and this year we continued to consistently deliver for our clients, our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share. Our financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform, the benefits of diversification and of scale, as well as an investment strategy focused on long-term growth and profitability. We remain very well positioned to continue to benefit in a growing global economy. Operator, we can open up the lines to questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. How are you? Marianne Lake : Very well, how are you? Betsy Graseck : Good. Two questions, one on the revenue lift in the consumer and community bank. I know on Slide 4, you highlighted that the 6% up year-on-year is driven by the higher NII and deposit margin expansion. Could you just describe a little bit if this is just the start of an improvement in transfer pricing that the consumer banking division is benefiting from, and is there a lag that we should expect would continue to drive up this revenue lift over the next several quarters? Marianne Lake : Betsy, there\u2019s no change in our transfer pricing methodology or even the way we compute it. It\u2019s to do, as you appreciate, with obviously higher rates and the fact that we are in a very disciplined environment at this point in deposit re-price. We would expect to continue to see the margin expand over the course of the next several quarters, but we would also expect to continue to drive higher NII as we\u2019re growing our deposits. (Indiscernible). Betsy Graseck : Right, but that FTP methodology should continue to drive up margin, deposit margin over the next couple quarters? Marianne Lake : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Then the second question is just how you\u2019re dealing with the Equifax fallout. The question here is does the breach that occurred drive any changes to how you are assessing credit requests that come in, how you\u2019re filtering for what you perceive as fraud risk, and how you\u2019re managing the book of outbound credit requests that you\u2019re looking for from a proactive perspective on your loan book? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I think the way to think about it, not to diminish the importance of any individual breach or situation, is that we are honestly under constant attack, both in a more general side but also from a fraud perspective, and so while we always react and learn lessons from every individual situation, this is not the first breach nor will it be the last breach, so as a result we have been constantly evolving and refining the way we think about fraud prevention, detection, underwriting, continuing to move to multi-factor protocols around customer identification, looking to leverage all of our data to better inform our underwriting decisions. So the reality is that as important as it is and as much as we--as each individual breach could impact the overall equation, we have had to evolve over an extended period to the position that we\u2019re in now, and so as a direct result of this, there won\u2019t be specific meaningful changes but a continuous evolution. So when we are looking, whether it\u2019s at sending out preapprovals or marketing offers or receiving inbound applications, we are increasingly looking at a number of different data points and facts to be able to identify the customer and understand the application. Jamie Dimon : And just to add, as part of a breach, so if your name was taken and we know that, Social Security, a driver\u2019s license, we can put in a lot of enhanced controls if we do about your name specifically. We don\u2019t have to rely on those things. With reduced reliance, we can greatly, dramatically increase anti-fraud on your accounts, so we do that and dramatically diminish any effect on our customers. Marianne Lake : Yes, and the reality, Betsy, is that we\u2019ve kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we don\u2019t know about or over time, and so we have to be proactive, not reactive, and we\u2019ll obviously look to learn anything we can but we continue to evolve, so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips. As a practical matter, we are not seeing a specific increase in fraud. Betsy Graseck : As a result, expense impact, loan growth impact, de minimis from your perspective? Marianne Lake : Correct, correct. As a result, we\u2019re already spending the money that we need to spend to keep hopefully ahead of the curves on all of these things. Our operating losses are--I will say that the combination of all of the information that had been compromised over the course of the last several years has put pressure on fraud costs, but nothing incremental from this, and so no, no impact on expenses or loan growth that would be measurable. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow up to your responses, Marianne, on no pressure on deposit pricing. I\u2019m wondering if you could, especially in light of your deposit growth strength and especially in the consumer, give us a sense on how re-pricing trends are today in terms of the consumer, wealth management versus wholesale deposits. Marianne Lake : Yes, so look, obviously apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter, and so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and not because that\u2019s surprising, so I\u2019ll come back to that in a second, which is to say that there\u2019s been very little to no movement in the re-pricing of deposit accounts. There\u2019s been some incremental movement in certain savings and CDs, but nothing systematic in the consumer space, but that\u2019s pretty much as we would have expected with rates at these absolute levels. So at some point in time, and that may be a couple, three more rate hikes from now, the dynamics may start to change, and so we haven\u2019t changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate re-price will look like. In asset wealth management, the story on deposit pricing is somewhat similar - a little bit more movement, but nothing particularly meaningful or dramatic. The story there is very much again as expected. At these levels of rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain of their deposit balances into investment assets. That\u2019s normal migration that we expected and that we\u2019ve modeled, and we are retaining those balances, so we are starting to see some of the dynamics we expected play out. That started happening at the beginning of the year and has continued to progress. Then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well, so I would start with we\u2019re firmly on a re-price journey in wholesale, no doubt, and depending on where you are in the spectrum it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the re-price is modest but present, to the higher end where it\u2019s reasonably high. So overall, if I step back--so that\u2019s where are. If I step back and say have we learned something new in this cycle that we didn\u2019t know, the answer is no, not really. If you look at the first four rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit re-price was pretty much the same as it is now, so we continue to believe that the dynamics that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last several years and that we\u2019ve expected will play out. They may not play exactly as we have them modeled, but they will ultimately play out that way and we have appropriately conservative re-price assumptions. Erika Najarian : Got it. My follow-up question on that is you\u2019re one of the few firms that have been really talking about anticipating the impact from a Fed balance sheet reduction over the next several years. The question I often get from investors is obviously in particular, retail is valuable not just for the price of it today but on an LCR basis, and how would you respond to the question, you know, given the 6% growth in digital in the consumer bank and 12% growth in mobile, does technology help with the stickiness of the consumer deposits, or does it potentially aid in the velocity of switching? Marianne Lake : So at the risk of hedging, it\u2019s actually a bit of both. The reality is there\u2019s always been two different camps on the re-price area for consumer. There\u2019s been the camp of acute market awareness, low for long, technology advancements allow movement of money to be easier, competition for retail deposits and good liquidity deposits is high, therefore re-price higher. The counter to that, which has merit and which we are seeing to a degree, is customers feel that they\u2019re weighing a more balanced scorecard of things when they chose where to keep their deposits, and customer satisfaction, the suite of products and simplicity, the digital and online offerings as well as the safety, security and brand all matter, and price is a factor but not the only one. So I would say we certainly feel that having a leading digital capability is critical to our overall customer franchise, and it will in all likelihood have an impact on stickiness of deposits because customers value that kind of convenience very highly. I would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that as you know, as much as you\u2019re right about the potential demand for the sort of high liquidity value deposits, there\u2019s a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system and although loan growth is solid, it\u2019s solid, so we aren\u2019t seeing a frenzy, albeit that we\u2019re very proud of our deposit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you hear me? Marianne Lake : Yes, welcome back. Mike Mayo : Thank you. My question is on the consumer and community bank, a three-part question. First, what percent of your customers have online bill pay? I\u2019m trying to get back to that stickiness of the deposits. Marianne Lake : I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but we can get back to you. Mike Mayo : Okay, can you give a ballpark? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve disclosed that before. Like, to the nearest quarter, or--? Marianne Lake : Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. I fear if I give you a ballpark, I\u2019ll get it wrong. While we\u2019re on the call, we\u2019ll get someone to send the details and let you know. Mike Mayo : Okay, and then the second part is you\u2019re talking--the deposit beta has been lower. You gave your caveat, but mobile bank customers are up 12% year over year. Why do you still need 5,200 branches? Isn\u2019t this a good time to close branches when deposit competition isn\u2019t as tough as it might be in the future? Marianne Lake : We\u2019re doing a bit of all of the above, so I\u2019ll start with the comment which you (indiscernible) before but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter, that 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches, that on average a customer comes into our branches multiple times in the quarter. I know that all sounds like old news, but it\u2019s still new news or current news, so the branch distribution network matters.  Customer preferences are changing and we are not being complacent to that, so we are underneath the overall 5,000-plus branches continuing to consolidate, close, move, grow, change all of our branches in line with the opportunity in the markets that we\u2019re in. So net for the year, we\u2019ll be down about 125 branches. We\u2019ve closed more than that, consolidated some and added some, so we\u2019re not being complacent to the consumer preference story, but branches still matter a lot and we\u2019re building out all of the other sort of omni-channel pieces, as you know, so that we have the complete offering. If the customer behaviors start changing in a more accelerated fashion, we will respond accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning Marianne and Jamie. A question first on the loan side on the yields. Last quarter they held flat, and this quarter they\u2019re up 16 basis points. I just wonder if you could help us understand, was that more just the mechanics of timing of hikes moving through your variable rates? Is it any element of pricing or any other things you could just help us understand why we saw that great nice improvement there? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I would characterize this as over the two quarters of normal, so you may recall last quarter there were a couple of things that we talked about. First was that there was a $75 million one-time interest adjustment in mortgage which artificially reduced loan yields for the quarter, and secondly that seasonality and mix in card similarly. So we would normally in the law of extraordinarily big numbers expect for a 25 basis point rate hike that we\u2019d see about 10-ish basis points of improvement in loan yields across the whole portfolio - we didn\u2019t see that last quarter. What you\u2019re seeing this quarter is the reversal of those factors and the normal benefit of the June rate hike. Ken Usdin : Got it, okay. My second question, with the card build, you took the reserve for card to around 3.3%. I know you had talked about staying below a 3% card loss rate for this year, but I\u2019m just wondering as we get into next year, you kind of had a medium term idea of 3 to 3.25, how are you feeling about that in terms of the seasoning of the card book and loss rates? Marianne Lake : Yes, so as we look at the loss rates for this year, they\u2019re coming in as we expected at less than 3%, and as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, it\u2019s still in that 3 to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range, so it\u2019s broadly in line with our expectations. So the reserve build--and you know, in the consumer space, we move our reserves not in dollar increments, but the reserve build is about a little less than one-third on the growth and a little more than two-thirds on normalization of rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s a little nitty gritty, but you\u2019re definitely the person for this. Point to point, the yield curve was about the same--10-year was about the same to point; however, throughout the quarter, the curve was much flatter. I\u2019m just curious if that has any dampening effect in any given quarter, and maybe the better way to ask it is could it have a little bit more of a positive run rate as we go forward? Marianne Lake : Yes, so a couple of things. The first is just to repeat the standard, just as a sort of macro matter, we\u2019re more sensitive to the short end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time, so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while it\u2019s not nothing, is unlikely to have a material impact on our run rate. Clearly an overall generally flatter long end of the curve in general on average through the year, all other things being equal, it will have had a dampening pressure on our expectations, and it\u2019s part of the reason why they went from 4.5 to 4, not the only ones, as we progressed through the year. But generally speaking, intra-quarter volatility is not something that would have a meaningful impact on our run rate. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. In terms of the loan growth, I think it\u2019s completely normal to see some moderation, and you\u2019re still doing reasonably better than the industry. I\u2019m curious on the main source of the moderation ticking down a little bit, and then more importantly, is it too soon to ask if any of this talk on tax reform and decent economic data is having a pick-up in the conversations on the loan growth side? Marianne Lake : Okay, so on the first, I think it is quite important to not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts, because we\u2019ve talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in the CIB, but loan growth is not really a thing there, and so this quarter we saw no loan growth in CIB, so no big deal, but it means that that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been outside of CIB, closer to 9, so start with that. Consumer has been pretty consistent, so across the consumer space, whether it\u2019s our jumbo mortgages, whether it\u2019s the business banking, card, auto loans and leases, they\u2019ve been growing at reasonably solid and consistent high single digit territory, or even low double digit for mortgage over the last several quarters. At this point, we don\u2019t really see anything that is suggesting that that will moderate meaningfully. So where you\u2019re seeing--and similarly in asset wealth management on the banking side.  So really, where you\u2019re seeing the growth moderate is in commercial, and it\u2019s in both the C&I loans and the commercial real estate loans, and they each have a story. With the C&I loans for us, the story is about moving from meaningfully outperforming the industry to being more in line with the industry, so over the course of the last couple of years as we\u2019ve added expansion markets, opened new offices, added a couple hundred bankers, developed our specialized industry coverage models, we\u2019ve been growing meaningfully better than the industry, and so you see that even in this quarter in our year-on-year growth of 8% as compared to the quarter-on-quarter growth, where it\u2019s flatter. That, to me, is really a factor of the fact that in this space in the cycle, our clients have strong balance sheets, they have a lot of liquidity, they have had access to the capital markets, and so GDP plus growth is not unlikely to be a level for the foreseeable future. With commercial real estate, it\u2019s slightly different. We\u2019re still outpacing the industry, but we\u2019ve kind of gone from very strong to strong, and we would continue to expect that to slowly moderate. That\u2019s a number of things - it\u2019s from higher rates, it\u2019s actually a lot of competition, and then it\u2019s also about clients and activity given where we are in the cycle, so we are being very cautious about new deals that we add to the pipeline and the client selection that we have. So all of those factors, I think, weigh into the commercial real estate space. Tax reform, so fiscal stimulus, the reality right now is although I think everyone, and ourselves included, are hopeful, obviously that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point it\u2019s not front and center in the dialog we\u2019re having with our clients about whether they should or shouldn\u2019t do a strategic deal or take an action, so I would say it is neither holding up business nor spurring business, but that could change. So at this point, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a factor but not a driving factor, and that could change. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Yes, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the outlook on the net interest margin. Should we still expect some grinding higher of asset yields, even without rate hikes? How do we think about that trajectory, assuming we don\u2019t get any more rate hikes from here? Marianne Lake : Well, we\u2019ll just deal with the fourth quarter because I think the landscape of rate hikes for 2018 is an open question. We would expect loan yields to hold relatively flat, all other things being equal. It\u2019s a very competitive environment. We aren\u2019t seeing--you know, we\u2019re seeing some pressure in commercial real estate spreads, we\u2019re seeing generally spreads holding up, but I would expect competitive pressures to keep loan yields relatively flat. Jim Mitchell : Okay, and on the reserve build outlook, should we still expect it to kind of track with growth and keep the reserve ratio similar in cards to where we are now, or do you still anticipate some additional building? How do we think about? And if you could size the hurricane impact, that would be great, this quarter. Marianne Lake : Yes, so we are--at this point, we are at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3 to 3.25 next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that we\u2019ll be adding to reserves. Our outlook for reserve add next quarter is below this quarter, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to observe that. With respect to the hurricanes, right now in this quarter\u2019s results in the credit lines in mortgage particularly and to a much lesser degree in wholesale, we\u2019ve effectively built $55 million of reserves. To sort of contextualize that, we have used our unfortunate experiences of Sandy and Andrew and other natural disasters to calibrate the assumptions we\u2019re using. At this point, it\u2019s early to be able to say how the losses will actually manifest themselves. It could be that it\u2019s lower than that, but that\u2019s our sort of central case right now, $50 million in mortgage and just a handful of million in the wholesale space. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could discuss how you\u2019re balancing all the investments you\u2019re doing in IT and business growth with the efficiency mindset that you guys always have. I guess one of the frameworks is if I look at the three-year simulation you provided in February, a lot of the expense growth seems to happen this year - we have kind of a $2 billion increase in adjusted expense in post-2017. The expense growth looks very modest, so maybe you could just talk a little bit about the leverage you\u2019re using to keep expenses in check as you\u2019re doing all the investments. Marianne Lake : I\u2019d just start with a bit of a philosophical discussion, which is it is our opinion that now, as much if not more so than ever, the investments we\u2019re making in technology will effectively breed and deliver the efficiency, so to the degree that we are able to find incremental investments or accelerate them, we\u2019ll be willing to do that. Our expense numbers in our outlook have never been targets, so that\u2019s the sort of mental, philosophical point of view, that we would deliver any technology innovation and investments that we could execute well that we think would be either accretive to our returns through revenues or efficiency. Specifically when you look at the simulation, just as a point of technicality, in 2018, probably middle to third quarter of 2018, we are expecting that the FDIC (indiscernible) will reach its level at which the surcharge will be able to be reduced. That\u2019s a meaningful positive for us, and so if you look at the implied growth and expenses from \u201917 through the medium term, they are larger than it implies, but if we found the opportunity to do more or to accelerate more, we would do it and explain it to you, so we\u2019ll come back to that at investor day. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Then just a follow-up, you mentioned the card revenue run rate has moved up again nicely this quarter. It seems like you might be able to get your target by the early half of next year. Is there upside to that revenue run rate target? Are things coming in better than expected in terms of the moderation of promo rates and things like that, or maybe you could just give a little color there? Marianne Lake : Yes, I think--so when we did some (indiscernible) at the end of last year, I think that we said that we\u2019d expect the revenue rate for the full year this year to be 10.5%, and it would be a little better than that. The revenue rate increase in the quarter speaks to a little bit of spread and a little bit of lower (indiscernible). It will go down next quarter because of the fourth quarter effect of the Sapphire reserve travel credit for an overall, call it 10.6 for the year. But yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year, and we\u2019ve reached the inflection point end of the second quarter and into the third quarter where growth is offsetting the impact of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire reserve, so we\u2019ll see revenues grow from here. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Following up, Marianne, on the commercial banking business, you\u2019ve had--you\u2019ve obviously had very good momentum there over the last couple years, and you did talk about credit dynamics and moderation in credit growth, and sort of a normalization back towards industry trends. Can you just comment a little bit more broadly about some of the initiatives you\u2019ve had there from a revenue standpoint, whether it be the middle markets initiative, growth in IB, international and whatnot? Your earnings growth has obviously been very, very strong in this business and it\u2019s starting to move the needle a little bit, but if you can just give us a little bit of color on the opportunity set you see there. Marianne Lake : Yes, so I\u2019ll just start with credit for a second, because although we absolutely expect at some point that we\u2019re going to see normalization of credit, we haven\u2019t seen that yet - I just want to make that clear. We are appropriately cautious and staring at everything, but we\u2019re not seeing any deterioration or any thematic fragility in our portfolio that we\u2019re concerned about at this point. With respect to the revenue side of the story and the efficiency side, it really is a story of all of the things you mentioned sort of all coming together at the same time, so we have been adding to--we have our expansion markets from the WaMu acquisition, we\u2019ve been adding new markets and opening offices, we\u2019ve been adding bankers, and as you know-- Jamie Dimon : We\u2019re in all 50 of the top MSAs now. Marianne Lake : Yes, we are in all 50 of our top MSAs now, and we\u2019ve been adding bankers. As you know, when you add all of these investments, for a period of time when they are still in the build-up mode, you don\u2019t see that drop to the bottom line or to the top line, and now we\u2019re starting to see our bankers hit their stride, become very productive, balances are building. Then, I would also say that this is at the epicenter of delivering the whole platform to our clients, so if you think about what we\u2019re able to offer our clients in terms of international capabilities, banking coverage across industries, core cash, global payments, we have a platform offering I think that is--well, it\u2019s certainly complete and it\u2019s somewhat differentiated. Then a third thing I would say is that it\u2019s a buttoned up business. We have been looking at efficiency and expenses and really working on making sure that through the simplification processes that we went through in 2013, \u201914 and \u201915, that we are focusing all of our efforts on our core strategic clients, and it\u2019s paying off. Saul Martinez : That\u2019s great. I guess sort of a related question on the commercial banking business that\u2019s a little bit of a follow-up as well on tax reform, obviously Congress--or the administration, House Ways and Congress released a blueprint so Congress can now start to flesh out a tax plan, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to the content, the timing - heck, whether it even happens or not. But if we do see something that is sensible, however you want to define it, how quickly do you think that we could start to see that beating through into better sentiment and ultimately into better demand, or increased demand for credit? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I would say--and like you said, there\u2019s so many uncertainties that it\u2019s almost talking about hypotheticals at this point, as encouraged as we are with the ongoing dialog. My view is sentiment is relatively high, in fact it\u2019s picked up slightly over the course of the last short while, so from that vantage point we\u2019re in a position of strength. There would necessarily be some lag, so whether that is a couple of quarters or longer, but certainly in the foreseeable future you would hope to be able to see increased demand and confidence leading to action. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Could you just talk a bit about how you\u2019re managing the excess liquidity? You\u2019ve obviously continued to build cash, the securities book has shrunk - it makes sense give the flatter yield curve, but you\u2019ve combined that with the still good deposit trends and the slowing loan growth, and obviously a challenge as you think about protecting them going forward. So maybe just talk about the dynamics there and how you\u2019re thinking about the yield curve, how to manage that. Marianne Lake : Yes, so I\u2019ll start with the excess liquidity question, because while we feel very, very good about our liquidity position, and you will have seen in the recent disclosures where everyone is positioned, and necessarily even if LCR was the only consideration people would want to be running a buffer to LCR, so--but LCR is not the only consideration, and the other most notable one I would point out to you would be resolution planning. So know that when we have our overall liquidity position, we\u2019ve taken into consideration a combination of constraints, and so what may look excess on one lever may not be as excess on another. The second I would say is that when we look at the deployment of (indiscernible), we look at it in the context of our target for what we want the duration of equity for the company to be over the course of normalization in rates, and obviously it\u2019s not just about liquidity, it\u2019s also about duration. So we\u2019re comfortable with our liquidity position, we have a framework for deploying it and for thinking about the spot and forward-looking duration of the company. That\u2019s not to say that we are not opportunistic in taking advantage of moves that are technical in the long end of rates to either deploy or to un-deploy, dry powder, and we still have some. So it\u2019s more than just liquidity, it\u2019s also duration, and we\u2019ve taken the overall (indiscernible) in our expectations and our targets into consideration, albeit that we still have some dry powder. Jamie Dimon : And we\u2019ve maximized between loans, securities. Marianne Lake : Yes. Matt O\u2019Connor: Then just to follow up on that rate sensitivity, you mentioned before or you reiterated before you\u2019re more levered to the short end of the curve. If we get continued increases on the short end of the curve but the 10-year doesn\u2019t go anywhere, is that still NIM accretive as it\u2019s been thus far? Marianne Lake : So it will be over the short while, and our full expectation outside of any other like stimulation is that as the front end of rates goes up and as gradual QE unwind happens, that you\u2019re going to see the long end of rates go up, albeit more slowly. So it\u2019s pretty typical at this point in the normalization cycle to have a curve flatten - that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s what we would expect. I would expect to continue to see the long end rise, and yes, it should be NIM accretive. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Marianne. You touched on this a little bit, but maybe you can give us a little more color. You mentioned in your opening remarks you increased your market share in investment banking. Can you share with us, are you getting a bigger wallet share or are you winning more customers, and also some of your competitors are still struggling, is that also a factor? Marianne Lake : I would say it\u2019s wallet share, it\u2019s blocking and tackling. We did pretty well in Europe but there is still a lot of competition, so I would say it\u2019s less about the specifics of any one competitor because the environment is pretty competitive, and just about sort of reasonably broad strength. Two things that I would also point out is, first, in equity underwriting, similar to in FIC, we gained a couple hundred basis points of share in the third quarter of last year, so on an apples to apples basis to where we would normally expect our share to be, we\u2019re still doing very well. Jamie Dimon : I would just say I think competition is fundamentally fully back. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re--or most of these players are all out there, some specialized in certain areas, but it\u2019s fully competitive, and you have new entrants soon like the Chinese banks, etc. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Possibly Jamie, if you want to weigh in on this, what\u2019s your read of the new treasury report on changes coming in the capital markets that was released in early October? Any specific items in there that you guys looked at that, that would be specifically beneficial that you\u2019d like to see changed, and what\u2019s the probability of it happening and could it happen sometime next year? Marianne Lake : Okay, that was a lot. So look, first of all, we welcomed the report and it\u2019s a long report, a couple hundred pages. There\u2019s a lot of recommendations, very comprehensive, so kudos to the treasury for delivering it. We are supportive of those recommendations kind of writ large, and I think the most important thing to remind you is that this is not about materially changing the legislative landscape. It\u2019s about recalibrating, sensibly recalibrating the specifics of individual rules over time. So we\u2019re still digesting the report, but we are supportive. It is very comprehensive and it could be very beneficial to the liquidity and depth of the capital markets, which is what we should all hope for, and not contrary to safety and soundness. So in that sense, very supportive, all good. It\u2019s going to be complicated and it will take time, but the will is there, and so whether it\u2019s the administration or the regulators, there\u2019s a general recognition that there\u2019s the ability and the appetite to want to make rational change, and so if that helps to grow the economy and all the things that come with that, we\u2019re working as constructively as we can on that. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet. Steven Chubak : Hi. Jamie, I was actually hoping that you could update us on your efforts to launch your online brokerage offering. It\u2019s something you had mentioned in your last letter. I was curious, since it comes up with investors quite often, how you view the opportunity set in that business for JP, whether it\u2019s an effort to just build a moat around your current client cash balances and maybe fill a void, or is your intention to become a bit more disruptive in the space and actually attract many more customers and potentially even offer more aggressive pricing and terms? Jamie Dimon : Yes, so we\u2019re building obviously--we\u2019re kind in beta platforms, we\u2019re trading and investing in things like that, and also the P2P (indiscernible) is doing quite well. We look at all those things as things you want to--from the client standpoint, you want to offer the client. At one point, we\u2019ll be talking about more testing what we think might or might not work, and then we\u2019ll give you more of a strategic view of that, probably around investor day. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. Marianne, just wanted to follow up on some of the discussion around excess liquidity management. I appreciate the fact that you guys certainly want to be conservative in thinking about duration and maybe taking a more holistic view of the asset side of the balance sheet, but looking at the LCR disclosures and just given the stark contrast in terms of how much you have parked in the way of excess reserves and relatively low levels of NBS compared with your peers, how you\u2019re thinking about duration management and whether you do have additional capacity to actually remix some of that cash of the Fed into higher yielding NBS, especially as we think about the Fed balance sheet unwind dynamics. Marianne Lake : We have a fairly large mortgage loan portfolio in addition to having a large portfolio in our investment securities in NBS, so we are already reasonably equivalently mixed in terms of our percentage of mortgage exposure to our total assets or loans to the competitive landscape. Trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR, and we are thinking about more than just LCR, and we do--as I said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we don\u2019t have the kind of capacity to invest $100 billion-plus in NBS right now, or anything that\u2019s meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration targets. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good morning Marianne. Just a quick question on loan growth. You had another decent quarter of good growth in residential mortgage. Maybe looking across consumer, is there anywhere where you\u2019ve had to kind of open up the credit box in order to get growth there? I know you mentioned that loan yields are expected to be tight on competition, and I think (indiscernible), but have you had to go down market at all for loan growth? Marianne Lake : No, we haven\u2019t. As we talked about before, a while ago we made some surgical changes to our credit box in the card space, but that\u2019s, if anything, I would say incredibly granular, incredibly surgically tightening, not the reverse. Whether that\u2019s in card, in certain micro cells, or whether that\u2019s in auto, I would say we\u2019ve been pretty conservative and we\u2019re probably doing at the very margins a little bit of tightening. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the quantum and timing of return of excess capital. Of course, one of your notable competitors has given a very detailed strategy of how to do this by the end of 2019. Are you in a situation to adopt a similar strategy/ Marianne Lake : Well I mean, congratulations to them if they have a high degree on what 2018 CCARs will look like. I will tell you this - we said very clearly that we feel that the company should operate within the range of 11 to 12.5%. We feel like it should be lower in that range, and having a capital plan approved as $19.4 billion of share buybacks over the next four quarters and over 100% payout based on analyst estimates is a start. So nothing has changed about that objective, but we would want to be measured about the pace at which we do it until we have a bit more final clarity on what the new generation of capital rules will look like, so we hopefully will know more as we go into the next cycle of capital planning. We haven\u2019t changed our point of view that we should be able to continue that journey down into the range, and that would be our objective. To tell you that we can give you the road map for that today, I think is not accurate. But you can do--you can and you have done your own math. Look at our earnings outlook in your models and payouts of over 100%, and you can see that we can move down in that same time frame to something much lower than we are now, if not towards the bottom. But that\u2019s not to say that we will be able to do that - we need to go through tests. Andrew Lim : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. A different question - (indiscernible) is high on everybody\u2019s minds. I think everyone is focused on the impact on equity research and FIC research, but there\u2019s broader implications possibly for how that might impact FIC trading, and not just from your own point of view but also from the point of view of clients who might not be compliant by the end of the year. How does that weigh on your mind, and what impacts could we expect there? Marianne Lake : I think I got that. So the compliance burden and the readiness and work to be ready is a significant heavy (indiscernible), as you say, for all market participants, so there is the possibility that effective at the beginning of the year, there will be ongoing work that needs to get done. We feel like we\u2019re reasonably well positioned to defend our position, but there\u2019s no doubt that over the course of the year and beyond that people get clearer and clearer on transparency and cost to execute versus advice, versus content, that there may be competitive dynamics that change, and we feel like we\u2019ve been building for the last several years to be ready for those dynamics. So there could be some bumps, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we\u2019re concerned about at this point, and we will all learn a little more as we go through 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Good morning, Marianne. I was going to ask you about the credit. You pulled out and highlighted auto after we went through kind of an episode of possible deterioration. You put that together with energy and what we experienced last year, those are our first two pressure points on the credit cycle, and really we\u2019ve come through without any real heartburn from either. Does that tell us something about the de-risking and underwriting discipline that the banks in particular have adopted since the financial crisis? Marianne Lake : You know, I would say that for sure has to be part of it, and even with the auto situation, what you\u2019re seeing is, I think, a marketplace that is much more responsive . So while we felt like we got ahead of the issues and tightened early, you\u2019ve seen the sort of industry generally move in that direction. I think there\u2019s no doubt that the environment in totality with capital liquidity controls regulation has led to higher quality loan books, so yes, we have been pressure tested. Energy was a one in a 100 year flood, and I think the industry and specifically our portfolio performed really quite well. Now that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t a point of pain out there somewhere that we won\u2019t see; we just feel like we\u2019ll be in a position to get through that. Marty Mosby : Then (indiscernible) deposit growth, what we saw is you kind of layer deposits in institutional deposits, corporate deposits, retail deposits. We\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a pressure and a sense of institutional deposits in wealth management began to decline. Corporate and retail still show a lot of strength. Just kind of think about that dynamic, because that\u2019s really where you begin to see pressure on betas, is typically when you see pressure on volumes, and we just haven\u2019t seen it in the core deposit base yet. So a premium for liquidity that\u2019s been kind of pushed into those core customers from corporate and retail, things should be pretty persistent, which would mean the duration and the length and the growth of deposits will be much longer than what we probably anticipated before? Marianne Lake : Yes. Yes, all of the above. I would tell you that we are seeing that rotation start. If you go back even three years ago, we kind of gave you an outline of what would happen. We said we were going to see rotation from the high wealth segment into investment assets, followed ultimately by the consumer space. We\u2019ll see retail deposits move into money funds, we\u2019ll see outflows of wholesale (indiscernible) deposits as the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, but those things are going to play out over the course of the next--you know, depending on the rate curve, over the course of the next two to four years, so we\u2019ve begun to see it. It should be expected. I don\u2019t think it tells us anything new or different necessarily at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, a follow-up question. So card revenues are tracking well, per your other comments, but year-over-year card spend growth has moderated some. Can you talk about the trends with the Sapphire reserve card? Marianne Lake : Yes, so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong, so when we say moderated, it\u2019s from very strong to very strong, and it is in part due to the number of new products we\u2019ve had. So we would continue--the Sapphire reserve card spending engagement is very strong, and we\u2019re very pleased with it, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a moderation necessarily. It\u2019s just at these very high levels, slightly higher to very strong is still a great story. Marty Mosby : It was such a great deal a year ago. What\u2019s the attrition like with the customers? Marianne Lake : If you think about our first acquisitions were in August and September, so we\u2019re kind of at the early stages. So far very encouraging, so far better than our expectations, but a little early to sort of draw some conclusions on it, but very encouraging. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Okay, thank you everyone. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $4.2 billion, EPS of $1.07 and a return on tangible common equity of 8% on revenue of $25.5 billion. The impact of the U.S. tax reform is the one significant item we have this quarter. We reported a $2.4 billion reduction to our fourth quarter net income. Excluding this, our performance would have been $6.7 billion of net income, EPS of $1.76 per share with an ROTCE of 13%.  Similar to the last few quarters, our underlying results were quite strong in the fourth quarter, and highlights included, average core loan growth of 6% year-on-year, bringing us to 8% for the full year; and credit performance continued to be very strong; a good holiday season fueled double-digit growth in Card sales and merchant volumes, each up 13%; our client investment assets were up 17%; we maintained our number one rank in global IBCs and we grew share; and we had record net income and revenue in the Commercial Bank and record revenue and AUM in Asset & Wealth Management.  Before I go into our results, let's spend time on tax reform on Page 2. The $2.4 billion impact of tax reform was largely driven by a deemed repatriation of our unremitted overseas earnings as well as an adjustment to the value of our tax-oriented investments, including affordable housing and energy. These were partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability. The impact is primarily in Corporate, but as you can see, there was some impact to each of the CIB and the Commercial Bank.  The capital impact is $1.2 billion higher at $3.6 billion or about 25 basis points of CET1. And our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which, it should start to gradually increase as certain business credits are phased out over time.  While there is now enacted bill, and with that, there's more clarity, there are still a number of open implementation as well as accounting questions that will require clarification. And as such, our estimated impact may be refined in future quarters. That said, I know there are a number of important questions which I'll try and get you clarity on.  First, with respect to the deemed repatriations, the operative word for us is deemed. In many ways, you can think of our unremitted overseas earnings as the equivalent of bricks and mortar being required in order to meet local jurisdictional capital and liquidity requirements. So we do not expect to actually remit anything significant.  Second, although the reduction in the corporate tax rate was 14%, you can see that the reduction in our effective tax rate is only about 10%, given the impact of the geographic mix of our taxable income, the disallowance of FDIC fees and smaller benefits associated with tax-exempt income and other deductions as a result of the lower absolute rate. Moving on to the BEAT tax, this is an area where there do remain open questions. However, at this point, we do not expect to have a BEAT liability. But if we are wrong, we would not expect it to be material.  Next, the question of whether the benefit will be competed away, and if so, over what time line. Pricing strategy will differ across products. It is true that we operate in competitive and transparent markets, and this means that ultimately, you could expect some of the benefit for the industry will be passed through to our customers over time.  Competition is one key driver, but there are other factors, such as scale, expertise, the breadth of your products and services and the investments that you're making in customer experience, and these matter a lot. And for certain of our businesses, pricing is not necessarily directly or immediately driven by fluctuations in the cost of capital, think flow markets. And remember, we didn't get to price up the changes in market structure and capital and liquidity over the last several years. So it will be nuanced, it will be different across products, and time is a very important dimension. Any competitive dynamic will play out over time.  We are in the process of putting together a cohesive and comprehensive set of long-term and sustainable actions for our employees, for customers and communities in part in response to tax reform. Some of our plans may involve subsidies for lower-income borrowers and support for small businesses. And for these customers and for some others, they may feel a benefit sooner.  With respect to our capital plan, there are no immediate changes to note. This won't change our overall strategy, and remember, the first half of 2018 is governed by last year's CCAR.  Finally, on the potential impact to our businesses, the modernization of the U.S. tax code is a significant step forward for the country and a big win for the economy. And we include an estimated 20 to 30 basis points of growth in the U.S. this year and next. However, clients are still digesting the tax bill, and much like this rate cycle, we haven't seen this movie before. We'll have to watch it play out. There will be pluses and minuses by client and pluses and minuses across the products.  So overall, stepping back, tax reform is a positive. And for our clients, there's more certainty, more clarity, and that should give them confidence to act. Moving now to Page 3, let's get into some details on the fourth quarter results. Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion or 5% year-on-year as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in Markets. Loan interest revenue was down modestly as growth in Auto as well as Asset & Wealth Management partially made up for lower Market performance. Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 9% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation.  In the fourth quarter, we took an impairment charge of a little over $100 million related to certain leased asset in the Commercial Bank. And we increased our contribution to the foundation, adding $200 million this quarter.  Credit cost of $1.3 billion were up about $450 million year-on-year. Charge-offs were flat, with an increase in Card being offset by continued decreases across other portfolios. And although net reserve builds this quarter were modest, we saw releases in the fourth quarter of last year of approximately $400 million. Shifting to the full year on Page 4. We reported net income for the year of $24.4 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 12% and EPS of $6.31. Adjusting for the two front-page significant items that we had this year, being tax reform this quarter and the benefit of the WaMu settlement in the second quarter, our net income would've been another record of $26.5 billion with an ROTCE of 13% and EPS of $6.87.  Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year which feels good, $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing, but pressured by lower Market NII. Noninterest revenue was up $400 million with higher Auto lease income as well as higher fees across the Investment Bank; Asset, Wealth Management; and Consumer, adding $2.6 billion to revenues and more than compensating for headwinds in Home Lending on a smaller market, investments in Card and lower Markets.  We ended the year with adjusted expense of $58.5 billion, but as you can see, we made a total contribution to our foundation this year of $350 million in part in anticipation of tax reform. This brings our adjusted overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. Credit cost for the year were $5.3 billion, down 1% as the environment remains benign.  Moving on to Page 5, balance sheet and capital. We ended the year with CET1 of 12.1%, down almost 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, about 25 basis points of which related to tax adjustments, and the remainder, loan growth. All the other ratios as well as tangible book value per share also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform. Moving on to Page 6 on Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 19%. We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending, up 13%; and Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 6%. Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industry-wide slowdown, given rising rates.  Card sales and merchant processing volumes were each up 13%, driven by continued strength from Card new products as well as ongoing momentum in Merchant Services. In December, we completed the acquisition of WePay, which marks a big step for us into the integrated payment space, allowing us to efficiently provide software-enabled payments to small business clients. And we also completed the renegotiation with Marriott for our co-branded cards, which will make us the largest issuer of the largest co-branded hotel program in the world. For all intents and purposes, we've now finished the renewals of our cobranded card deals.  Revenue of $12.1 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was down 15% on lower net servicing revenue driven by MSR as well as loan spread compression. Our originations were down 16% and the Markets down an estimated 25%. And we gained share, a trend we expect to continue, given our investments. And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 11% year-on-year on higher Auto lease income, growth in Card loan balances and margins and lower net acquisition costs.  For the full year, Card revenue rate was 10.6%, in line with our guidance, and we still expect to reach 11.25% in the first half of this year. Expense of $6.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth. The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of '17.  Finally, on credit. Card charge-offs came in line with guidance for the year at 2.95%. The increase in Card charge-offs was predominantly offset by preceding credit performance across other portfolios. In terms of credit reserve, the net $15 million build this quarter was driven by a $200 million build in Card on growth, offset by releases in Home Lending of $150 million and Auto of $35 million. And as I noted last quarter, Auto trends have stabilized and the industry feels to be on solid footing.  Now turning to Page 7 in the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $7.5 billion and an ROE of 12%. But revenue was impacted by 2 noteworthy items this quarter, and both of them had an impact in Markets, so I'll start with Markets. Total Markets revenue was $3.4 billion, down 26% year-on-year. However, Fixed Income Markets included the net impact of tax reform on our tax-oriented investments which was approximately $260 million, accounting for 6% of the year-on-year Markets decline. Additionally, Equity Markets included a notable loss of $143 million on a single margin loan. This accounted for 3% of the year-on-year decline. It's worth noting that the loss appears here in Markets as we elected fair value option on this loan. However, when you do industry comparisons, be aware that others involved in this facility may not have made that same election and may have all of their losses in credit. So in addition, although not in Markets revenues, $130 million of credit cost this quarter was driven by a reserve build related to that same name.  So adjusting for those items, our Markets revenue would have been down 17% year-on-year, which is much closer to the experience up to the beginning of December, when we last spoke publicly.  Fixed income revenue was down 27% adjusted, principally driven by a tough prior year comparison and low volatility and tight credit spreads which have continued into this quarter. Equities revenue was up 12% adjusted against the record fourth quarter of '16. And similar to the past few quarters, the driver of the increase was continued tailwinds from investments in cash, prime and corporate derivatives.  Moving on to banking. We had a record year for total fees and for debt underwriting fees. We maintained our number one rank in global IBCs while growing share and we also ranked number one in North America and EMEA. This quarter, IB revenue was $1.6 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by broad strength across capital markets. Advisory fees were up 2% as we saw good momentum with some large deals closing. We ranked number two for the year in wallet, gaining share. And we completed more deals than any other bank.  Equity underwriting fees were up 14%, with indices up across every region and several at or near all-time highs. We maintained leadership positions in wallet and volumes across every product globally this year. And while we ended up number two in wallet, the distance to number one was only a few basis points.  And debt underwriting fees were up 12% as the market remained receptive to new issuance across high-grade and leveraged finance and refinancing activity was strong. We maintained our number one rank. We gained share, and this year, booked around the most number of deals in the firm's history. The overall pipeline remains healthy and at levels similar to last year. Our balance sheets are strong and market conditions favorable.  Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 13%. In addition to higher rates, we continued to see organic growth within the business as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform.  Security Services revenues of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year-on-year, and higher asset-based fees on record AUC, given higher market levels globally.  Finally, expense of $4.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by the relative timing of compensation accruals. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 27%; for the year, 28%, broadly in line with prior year.  Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 8. I was another outstanding quarter for the Commercial Bank, with record net income of $957 million, record revenue of $2.4 billion and an ROE of 18%. And for the year, net income and revenue were also records. The business is firing on all cylinders and delivered an ROE of 17%. For the quarter, revenue included a benefit of a little over $100 million associated with tax reform and in our Community Development Banking business. Even without this benefit, revenue would still be a record, up 14% year-on-year, on higher NII from higher rates as well as deposit and loan growth across businesses.  IB revenue of $587 million was down 3% year-on-year, but still a strong performance. For the full year, we saw record IB revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, with particular strength in middle market, which was up over 50%, compensating for a smaller number of large deals. The pipeline and momentum into the first quarter feels good. Expense of $912 million included an impairment charge, also, of a little over $100 million on certain leased equipment which we expect to sell in the first half of this year. Excluding this, we saw got expense growth of 9% as we executed on our technology and product investments. And this year, we added net 120 new bankers in the business and entered six new markets, giving us a presence in all top 50 MSAs.  Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year, 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by continued strength in expansion market and specialized industries. While sequential growth was up a more modest 1%, we are seeing decent deal flow and pipelines are holding steady. Client sentiment continues to be strong, supported by corporate tax reform.  CRE saw growth of 9% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, in line with the industry. Multifamily lending continued to see tightened pricing on elevated competition. We remain appropriately focused on client selection, given where we are in the cycle and with particular caution around construction lending. Finally, credit remains among the best we've seen. This quarter, we saw a benefit of $62 million, largely driven by reserve releases in the Oil & Gas portfolio. And net charge-offs were four basis points.  Leaving the Commercial Bank and moving on to Asset, Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $654 million with a pretax margin of 30% and an ROE of 28%. Revenue was a record $3.4 billion this quarter, driven by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposits and loans. For the full year, net income and revenue were records with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 25%. Expense for the quarter of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by a combination of higher compensation as well as a gross up for external fees which is offset in revenue.  For the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows of $30 billion with positive flows across all asset classes on continued strong long-term performance. For the full year, we had long-term net inflows of $68 billion, driven predominantly by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. Record AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 15% and 14%, respectively, year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 10% year-on-year, down 2% sequentially, reflecting continued migration into investment-related assets, the vast majority of which we are retaining. And new client flows remain healthy. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 11% year-on-year; including mortgage, up 14%.  Moving to Page 10 and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $2.3 billion, which includes $2.7 billion of the tax reform adjustment. Treasury & CIO's results improved year-on-year, primarily due to the benefit of higher rates.  So finally turning to Page 11 and the outlook. Before I get to specifics, remember, we do have Investor Day coming up in February, so we will be giving you a lot more guidance there. So that leaves me with two structural things to talk about, the first, staying on the theme of tax reform. And lower corporate tax rate in 2018 will have the effect of reducing the tax equivalent adjustments or gross ups in our managed revenues. On a run rate basis, that reduction for the full year will be about $1.2 billion, and more than half of that is in the NII.  Secondly, effective January 1, 2018, a new revenue recognition accounting rule came into effect, which requires certain expenses to be grossed up that were previously recognized as contra expense -- contra revenue. We estimate, for the full year, the impact will increase both revenues and expenses for the firm by another $1.2 billion, the vast majority of which will be in Asset, Wealth Management with a small amount in the CIB.  So for guidance, expect the first quarter NII will be down modestly quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a combination of the lower gross ups I mentioned as well as normal day count which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth. And we estimate the first quarter effective tax rate will be about 17%, reflecting seasonality of stock comp adjustments.  So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets; higher interest rates; good economic data globally; decent client activity; high levels of confidence; and, obviously, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Against that backdrop, our underlying financial performance in the fourth quarter and 2017 was strong, benefiting from diversification and scale and consistently delivering for our customers and communities, gaining share across our businesses.  Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been clear records, driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity. We're excited about the landscape and the opportunities for our clients in 2018. We will be there for them, and the company is poised to continue to perform.  With that, operator, I will take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : So I do expect you to defer either the response to February 27th, Marianne, but I just had to ask the question. The revenue outlook seems to be quite strong for the banking industry generally in 2018, and many investors were wondering, is the 55% overhead ratio a long-term target for JPMorgan, regardless of the revenue environment? Or could that potentially be better over the short term as we get a boost in the economy from the Tax Act? Marianne Lake : So I mean, you are right. that's probably more of an Investor Day discussion. But what I would tell you is that when we have given that as our sort of medium-term guidance, in our simulation, we kind of imagined an environment that was more normalized in lots of ways. So we anticipated higher -- more normal interest rates, we anticipated the continuation of somewhat benign credit and we anticipated continuing to invest in the businesses. And you've seen us do it in 2017, and we would expect to do it and more in '18. So certainly, there could be years when we would be below it, and there have been years when we were above it, but I think it's still a decent place for us to be aiming for in the near term. Erika Najarian : And my follow-up question to that is a lot of investors are excited about the prospect of stronger economic activity in 2018 leading to greater markets activity and greater lending activity. And if you look back into the 1980s, at least for loan growth, loan growth actually stepped down in 1987. And I'm wondering if you could share your insights on how you think those activity trends will shape up in 2018. Marianne Lake : Yes. So I know that everybody is eagerly awaiting there to be direct and noticeable impacts of tax reform, but we're only a couple of weeks into the year. And so our expectation, as I said before, just really stepping back, is that there it will boost growth in the economy. People have different points of view. Our research team is saying by up to 30 basis points in each of the next two years. But know it could be better than that. We do know that there will be puts and takes across our businesses, but in general, we would expect that the sort of certainty that people have been waiting for, coupled with the confidence that we know they've had, and the need for people to try and deliver growth to their shareholders, should mean that things that they were going to do become more compelling and they might be willing to do more. So I think you'll see the capital markets space potentially react more quickly and I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never.  So we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out. But sentiment is strong. Cash positions will be improved, profitability will be higher, things that were rich before will be more fairly valued now. And so I think it should be all very constructive. And certainly, we would take the upside, and we support our clients. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Maybe a question on NII, just I want to make sure I understand the moving parts. So if I think about your guidance for the first quarter of down slightly. You have two less days in the quarter, that's maybe almost $300 million sequentially. And then half of the impact from the Tax Act in terms of tax equivalent adjustments is going to be felt in NIIs, that's sort of linear and equal, so that's another $150 million. So if I do the math, is it about a $400 million sort of apples-to-apples benefit from higher rates that you've seen? Is that the way to think about it? Marianne Lake : It's a good model with just one clarification. So yes, a little more than half of the gross-up adjustment is NII. Yes, it is broadly linear for the sake of argument. So $150 million is not a bad estimate, it's actually more like $160 million, but pretty close. The day count is actually not worth $300 million, it's worth a little bit less than $200 million. So you've got a sort of headwind, for want of a better word, of call it $300 million and change. And then we would have had a combination of the impact of the December hike, with obviously each hike, the impact is less, some growth and other puts and takes. So call it $350 million of a headwind offsetting growth, and the rate hike. James Mitchell : Right. And just to follow up on -- it seemed like deposit betas actually slowed this quarter. And what do -- you're expecting that to sort of reaccelerate this year. How do we think about, I guess, beyond 1Q in the benefits of rates? Marianne Lake : So I would say about deposit betas, at this point, you really do have to think about it in a sort of bifurcated way. So firstly, I would say that the cumulative beta we've experienced, and I wouldn't say we've seen it slow down, but it's remained discipline generally. What we've seen so far in the rate cycle is very similar to what we saw in previous rate cycles. So it's not like we learned stunning new news from which we can extrapolate and make changes to our expectations. So we have no real change in the long-term expectations to reprice. And it really is a bit point -- bifurcated. So retail, checking and core savings, there have been little to no movement in the industry. Again, given the absolute level of rates, that would be in line with our expectations. And on the wholesale space, we're definitely in reprice territory. It is accelerating with every hike and it's different across the spectrum. So obviously, more significant in the sort of TS, Securities Services space. So -- but my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates is that on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018. But ultimately, we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that time line looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50%, but we'll have to see. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Sorry, I was on mute. It feels like we have a once in a lifetime, or at least in my lifetime, benefit to earnings with this tax change. And we've got a lot of PMs asking the question how our management's going to use that. I saw your comment in the deck that competitive over time, compete away, blah, blah, blah. But I wonder if you could help give us some insight as to how, at a management level, you're thinking about strategically using this benefit that you're getting in the various buckets of reinvest in tech, reinvest in people, reinvest in clients. Do you feel like it's equal across those? Or is there a skew that you're thinking about to take advantage of this? Because how managements use this benefit is going to be critical for stock performance over the next 2 to 3 years. Marianne Lake : Yes. So I mean, I'll give you a framework to think about it, if it's helpful. And you can certainly ask a follow-up question. But you are very familiar with the way that we think about sort of our strategy over time and our investment strategy in particular. And investing in our businesses for growth and profitability has always been first and foremost in our minds. And to be honest, we've talked to you before about the fact that we don't constrain ourselves because we have budgetary targets on those activities if we think we can execute well and we see great opportunity. So expect that the first thing that we would do is to continue to lean into the investment opportunities we have writ large. So that's bankers, that's offices, that's global expansion to the degree that that's on the cards. It's digital capabilities, copayments capabilities. It's across all of our businesses. And we've been working even before tax reform on identifying where those opportunities are, and we want to lean into that. And Jamie said it earlier, we are really pleased that there are some immediate responses for employee benefits. And we will be doing that plus more across our stakeholder constituents. And there will be more to come on that over the next few weeks. And we want to focus on that being, like, comprehensive and sustainable. So we're really trying to be thoughtful about the things that will matter to our employees and to our customers. And then to the degree that we end up still with earnings that were otherwise above plan, then our normal capital strategy comes into play. We've been clear. We think that we are adequately capitalized, that we should expect to have the capital ratio move down slowly over time. And our strategy on potentially continuing to see dividend increases and having repurchase programs that allow us to achieve our target ratio, that hasn't changed. It just might be a bigger dollar number. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Just to move to, I guess, a business question. A couple of things just on the Card business. Just looked like credit continues to be pretty good. You did build the reserve for growth, as you mentioned. But noticed that the Card revenue rate was also still a little bit down. Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook for that Card business as you look forward? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I'll just deal with the Card revenue rate real quick because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter, that given the Sapphire Reserve product and given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is an annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you, which you would expect to see the revenue rate go down. It was contemplated, and which is why our full year revenue rate of 10.6% was in line with our guidance. And as we lap the acquisition costs and reward costs associated with acquiring all of those Sapphire Reserve customers, and for that matter, our other new products, we're going to see that revenue rate get to the 11.25%, if not in the first quarter, in the first half of next year. And you're going to stabilize out at or above that level. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And just that's great to hear, that impact. And then just consumer credit, broadly speaking, Auto has continued to look a little bit better and Card's still within reasonable expectations. So a lot of the focus on tax has obviously been on the potential for commercial lending to potentially pick up. How are you guys just thinking about how the consumer behaves and what that means for both consumer loan growth and consumer credit? Marianne Lake : Yes. So again, it's nuanced, so what I expect though, the first question generally that we're getting is the impact on the housing market given certain specific changes in the tax code. I would say that overall, net-net, we would expect there to be not a significant impact on the housing market and demand nationally, although it could differ by state. So we feel like that's going to hold up nicely. And then you're right. Whether you're talking about consumers or whether you're talking about small businesses, think about the small business environment, this was quite positive for them, so they're going to see higher profitability, higher free cash flow, and to all intents and purposes, the equivalent of an upgrade. So we would be hopeful that, much like the commercial space, that could be the catalyst to see them spend money and hire. And we'll be focusing on that as we think about programs to help. So I think in general, it's going to mean that the already very good credit trends we're seeing will be good for longer. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So first question on fixed income. And I guess the question is if not now, when? I mean, the industry's gone down, had this multi-multi-year degraded in revenues for lots of structural and cyclical reasons. We now have -- we're off QE in the U.S., we're raising rates in the U.S. Europe's doing better. They are still on QE and have low to negative rates, but we might get some changes there. Can you talk about your best guesses in terms of the backdrop for this environment for such an important revenue item? Marianne Lake : Sure. So Glenn, because I feel like in 2017, we spent so much time talking about year-over-year declines in comparable periods, it's helpful to, I think, that back -- remember the full performance for 2017 for fixed income and for equities and to markets in total. And so acknowledging that the first quarter was quite strong, if you look at the last three quarters, we were talking about reasonably quiet environment, low volatility, historically tight spreads. And yet, those businesses individually and together delivered meaningfully above the cost of capital for us. So maybe not at the sort of outperformance level of 2016, but really good performance. So discipline, scale, optionality, those are the ways we think about fixed income business. And so although I don't -- I'm not going to -- I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you when there will be a catalyst for change. Fixed income is a little on the counter-cyclical side. There will be change. And we're positioned to continue to be able to grow with our clients. So our businesses are doing well. And can't tell you when things will become more volatile. And obviously, that's always an emotional discussion. But it will happen. And when it does, we will be there to serve our clients and to be there for them. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Follow-up is on Steinhoff. And I know the -- a, you can't predict fraud. But I'm just curious on that as a business in general, and lots of other banks were involved. But how many other similar types of books are there? And can you talk to the nature of those relationships? Because hindsight's 20/20, and like, wow, that's a lot of leverage to give somebody on a highly active stock. But it's usually just the customer flow, simple in and out facilitation business. So I wonder if you could just talk about it a little bit more. Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean, this will garner attention because of the sort of sudden and significant decline. And it is by far and away the largest loss in that business that we've seen since the crisis. And know it will happen from time to time, maybe not this significantly or this suddenly. And remember that because we've got that in fair value, we brought that down, down. So that's not a reserve, that's a mark to market on a publicly traded equity at this point that is significantly down. And so I would say while we are obviously disappointed with the outcome, it's the business we're in. It's a large and diversified business, that even after this loss, it's still very profitable. So it's noteworthy because of its size, its rapidity and it's significant. But it's a profitable business. And without sort of laboring the point, obviously, we go through talking about the potential for there to be rifles and sudden-risk situations. And I've talked a little about that in our governance processes. And sometimes, that will happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of wells Fargo Security. Michael Mayo : I just wanted to follow up on the tax question. Jamie says on Page 1 of the release that you'll have an accelerated spend for those tax benefits for employees, customers, communities. And I know you kind of answered that, but so how much of that benefit -- I guess you paid $11 billion in taxes last year and that might have been under $7 billion with the lower rate. So if we assume a $4 billion tax benefit, if that's correct, how much of that would be passed on to the employees, customers and communities versus hitting the bottom line? And then the philosophical question, if Jamie's there, if he could answer after you, should that be crucial for stock performance, how much you allow to fall to the bottom line? Marianne Lake : Yes. So look, I'm not going to give you, like, quantification, but you're not meaningfully wrong about the sort of assessment you made, which it is a big, significant positive and much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond. And time is an important part to how this plays out. So we want to do really constructive, thoughtful things for all of our constituents, but it won't be the significant portion of that. James Dimon : Yes. I would just say that we take the $3.5 billion benefit next year. The two major you should in put back of your mind uncertainties, one is the code has to be actually written. And so there'd be a lot of noise going down the road about what that actually means for various industries and stuff like that. And the second area, as spoken by extensively, is competition. Some of it, some will be competed away. So I'm going to -- I'm only telling you because you've got to put it in your mind. I think it's so exuberant that everything, everywhere falls into the bottom line. The second is on our investment. Mary's already spoke that we already are fairly aggressively investing for our future. And in some places, I'm pushing this trade. We can't -- you can only go so fast in hiring new bankers and doing some things, and we may accelerate some of that.  At Investor Day, we'll be quite clear if we change how we look at that kind of thing. And the other one is what are we going to do special to help the United States of America as realty tax change? And we think we should, We think it's very good the other companies have done it. We think it's time that all of America shared broadly. And we're going to have things that we think are good for some employees. But think of also sustainable growth for communities around the world. And so we're going to give you, in the next couple of weeks, some very thoughtful things that we're going to do. And it may very well bite into some of that $3.5 billion, and so be it. That's what we're supposed to do. We're a bank. We're supposed to help support and grow communities. And it will enhance our growth in the future, too, by the way. So it isn't, like, a giveaway, it's kind of a thoughtful flows to how we should use some of this. Marianne Lake : And I do want to just -- like, there are two other things, just after what Jamie said, which is if some of this is competed away over time and get to lower cost of credit and lower cost of borrowing and improved pricing to our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop. Similarly, if at the end of the day, it results in some higher dividend or repurchases, that also recycles back into the economy. So it was very optimistic for the performance of this company, which is extraordinarily client-centric. So anything that's good for the economy and our clients will continue to drive long-term profitability for the company. That would to be number one. And number two, not to be defensive, but you guys will appreciate this more than anyone almost, is you can do your own math. But if you add up the cost of controlled market structure reform, capital and liquidity, much of which we're entirely supportive of. But if you add up the impact that had on our returns over the last 5 to 10 years, I mean it, in many ways, dwarfs this. So there will be an element of this that goes back into making sure that the banking system is probably covering the cost of equity, and it should. Michael Mayo : One follow-up on that feedback loop. So you, Marianne or Jamie, a year from now, do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in an increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CapEx, which we've been waiting for all decade? James Dimon : Yes. Again, I think it's really important to note. People focus very much on what happens tomorrow because of tax reform. I think it's a very good thing. You've seen it with corporations, you've seen it with sentiment, you've seen it with people's plans and things like that. I think it's very good. I think the far more important thing is that 20 years ago, our corporate federal estate rate was 40%, the rest of the world was 40%. Over 20 years, they came down to 20% and we stayed at 40%. Over that time, it's driven brains, capital, you see the reinvested money overseas. One of the accounting firms did a study of 5,000 companies that would have been headquartered here, are either headquarter overseas or owned by a foreign company, which I'm not against, it's a huge number. It's the cumulative effect of retained capital and increasing competitive American companies that will drive jobs and ways in the long run. I have absolutely no question that we will be far better off year after year if you're having done this. And it's just impossible to tell exactly what it means this month or this quarter or something like that. So we're going to be watching, just like you, and waiting just like you. But I hate guessing about the effect, like, on capital markets. I don't know. The fact is we look at capital -- we have fabulous people in sales and trade, fabulous research, great technology capability. In the last five years, we dealt with Dodd-Frank, MiFID, all these rules and regulations, steps, what are the other ones called in Europe, and we've done okay. I look at it as all a big positive. And we'll still be there buying and selling securities for our clients, issuing securities. And yes. I think if we're right about it in improving American competitive growth in the global economy, it will drive just capital markets activity. Let's just wait and see. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Apologies if this is asked. I got cut off for a second. Marianne, was wondering about charge-offs and credit. Things looked good this quarter, for the full year, it came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook. Was wondering how you're thinking about the credit environment heading into this year. And if the environment remained strong, do you still have some seasoning that might put some upward pressure on charge-offs, even in a good environment? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I would say if you look across the consumer sector, x Card, the credit performance is, like, really, really good and should continue to be really good in 2018. So 2018 feels like very strong credit performance in Consumer. In Card, we said at Investor Day, that we would expect to continue to see charge-off rates go up, and we are growing loans. So a combination of those things will mean we'll have higher charge-offs and some reserve builds. I will tell you that we're not seeing anything that isn't in line with our expectation. So this is not normalization deterioration, this is seasoning and maturation of the newer vintages and growth. And so if I sort of sent you back to what we talked about earlier in the year, it's probably closer to 3.25%, but in line with our expectations. So we're expecting very much more of the same in the consumer space. And in the wholesale space, credit is really, really good. And some of the places where we had been watching for there to potentially be stress, fundamentals are improved. And we continue to obviously watch retail and to be cautious, given where we are on certain parts of real estate banking. But we're not seeing any fragility right now in our outlook. John McDonald : Okay. And then just a follow-up on Card. You've had some good balance growth. Are you seeing any change in propensity to revolve from your customers? Or is your balance growth coming more from new customers? Or is there any increase in kind of revolve rate? Marianne Lake : So we actually had been on a pretty significant strategic drive to make sure that we had a deeply, deeply engaged customer base. If you go back precrisis and look at the industry, there was also a balance focus and less engaged customers. So we worked really hard over the course of the last many years to drive engagement, which is why you can see that we have a larger share of spend that we do of outstandings, but we've grown both. So we are getting balances from new customers. We are working on making sure that the right customers are revolving. And we're making progress. So year-on-year, we've gained share in both and we'll continue to focus on revolve. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet. Steven Chubak : Marianne, had a question on the tax guidance that you guys have given. The Slide 2 disclosure's really helpful, but I really wanted to dig into the comment on the BEAT provision. You noted that the ultimate impact for your business shouldn't be material, and at the same time, the guidance from some of your foreign bank competitors, suffice it to say, has been much more measured. And I'm wondering if the impact's not that material for you guys but weighs more heavily on the peer set. Do you actually see a market share consolidation opportunity emerging potentially with -- and in particular within the repo and sec lending sides? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I mean, obviously, the impact is differently situated for the foreign banking set. And I know that there -- as Jamie said, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of implementation and finalization of the actual code itself. So I don't want to guess on how all that will play out. I certainly don't want to guess about the second order impact of potential consolidation. Steven Chubak : All right. Fair enough. Well, maybe just try one more on tax specifically relating to CCAR. I'm assuming that the test parameters for '18 are broadly consistent with last year, which I think is most people's general expectation. You have the lower starting capital ratio from the tax hit. Your peers will have the same thing. But within the new tax law, there's also a somewhat complicated element where it eliminates the ability to carry back NOLs against prior period income, which could impact your stressed ratios. And I'm wondering, does that at all inform your outlook for the incoming test? And do you anticipate capital return capacity being more constrained just in light of some of those changes? Marianne Lake : Okay. That was a lot. So if you assume that the 2018 structure is much like 2017 with a nice healthy caveat that DTAs, DTLs and the impact of them can be volatile based on the scenario, so with that caveat, I would tell you that not carrying back NOLs has a very particular interplay with foreign tax credits, which means it's not really going to affect us in a meaningful way. There are two things that would change, but they also offset. So the two things that would change is your absolute level of losses would be higher as the tax rate is lower, against -- and so that would be a negative. But against that, your NOL carryforward would be lower and that the capital deducts. So in the lore of very big numbers with health warnings, plus or minus, at our low point, we think not a significant impact. And then if you were to take a look at our starting point capital, I'd just make two comments. The first is, obviously, given all of the conversations we've just had, there is also the strong possibility that we will have higher earnings in the first half of the year and be able to accrete back portions, if not all of that, capital. And secondly, for what it's worth, our actual spot capital ratios were higher than our CCAR outlook was. So both from a starting point and tax effective, I feel okay, but that's a really complicated question, and we need to, like, really work through it. James Dimon : And there's a new sheriff in town. And they're going to be looking at the whole picture. I think it's probably more important than this one item. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Marianne, assuming the economy in 2018, '19 accelerates due to this tax reform, I think it may imply that we would have higher interest rates and possibly a steeper yield curve. Do you guys have any thoughts on what you might do to the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet? Would you change it? Or do you want to just keep it the way it is? Marianne Lake : Yes. So I mean we -- for what it's worth, you should know our house view on interest rate is for there to be four hikes next year. The Fed says three, the market has two. I would say tax reform and a stronger growth outlook will solidify the path of rate hikes. And so we've been factoring that into our balance sheet positioning anyway. So I would not expect there to be a material change in our strategy. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then in your release in the fourth quarter, you guys said how would the tax change affect your capital distribution plans. And there's no change and the first day of distributions are going to be based on the 2017 CCAR approval. Is that in terms of the payout ratio on this 2017 CCAR, or the nominal dollars? Because obviously, your earnings now are going to be higher in the first half of '18 versus what you got approved for in the CCAR '17, which would imply, if you get the payout ratio constant, you would actually have a higher nominal payout in the first half of '18. Marianne Lake : Our capital plan approval is on a nominal dollar basis. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: It's probably a bit early to know how to come play this, but as you think about the winners and losers from tax reform, do you think there will be changes in terms of how you come to market, where you come to market? A lot's been written obviously on the impact to some of the high tax states and how money can flow from there to others. And obviously, you're in some high tax states and also in low tax states. And just trying to think through how you might tweak your business model or you have to focus on some of your products in some of those markets. Marianne Lake : Yes. So as I would say, I mean in essence, time is our friend. So if you go back and obviously, nothing is exactly like this. But if you go back and look at similar empirical evidence, you would say that any influences in terms of migration of flow funds is pretty modest and pretty gradual. And if you think about something as first order as housing in high tax states, well, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs and higher income borrowers activity is less price-sensitive. So I think lots and lots of things come into play. I think the area that we're getting -- that we're thinking about a little more is what's the optimal financing structure for clients given the changes across the capital market structure. But even in that sense, while you could say that may be more expensive, it's still probably cheaper than equity, and equity may be more seen as fair value. But for JPMorgan, it's core to what we do. We do cross-border acquisition, acquisition financing, liability management, and those capital structure strategies, we do all of it. So even if the sort of mix and optimal structure change, I think we're pretty well situated. So it's early days to be able to say that we would have strategic changes. I think it's early days. And I would say that if that was to be the case, I would probably expect it to be quite marginal. Matthew O'Connor: And then how about just more on aggregate on the consumer underwriting side, if you are feeling more positive about the economy, you're seeing the growth in consumer personal income before the tax code here that may accelerate, does that make you more open to loosening underwriting standards a little bit? Do you feel like aggregate standards are still similarly tight versus where they were pre-crisis and there could be some opportunity there for you and others? Marianne Lake : Yes, I mean, I think that may be a fair observation but I also think, to Jamie's earlier point, as much as we would like to imagine that all of this takes effect immediately, you would need to see the benefit of the environment in the income and spending and profitability and creditworthiness of people before you would be able to lean in for the changes, if necessary, so maybe. But again, I think it's going to be something that will unfold. James Dimon : Yes. So we haven't changed our stance very much, and the one exception that might change over time, which I hope it does actually, is in mortgage lending, where I think because of the service requirements, capital requirements, reporting requirements and various litigation uncertainty, it has tightened the credit box around people who probably deserve credit, younger people, first-time buyers, prior defaults and -- but that's going to take the agencies working together to set new rules and new guidelines. If that happens, that can actually be good for America. It doesn't not really-- Marianne Lake : And pretty immediate. James Dimon : Yes, it's not going -- say that again? Marianne Lake : And pretty immediate. James Dimon : And pretty immediate. And it's not going back to subprime, it's just opening up the credit box and reducing the cost to the average mortgage, and we're hopeful that the agencies will eventually do that. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : I just wanted to take a devil's advocate for each for a bit. I've looked at the credit markets and the oil cap has increased right across the spectrum, especially at the short turn actually rather than the long end. And I'm thinking that these high-interest rates would feed into high credit losses at some point. I'm wondering if that's part of your thinking, whether that fits into your credit quality models. And if so, at what time -- where do you think that the duration in credit might start to accelerate? Marianne Lake : So probably it's an important thing because I think it's worth pointing out that there's been a lot of attention on the flatter yield curve, but you're right, it's driven by a higher fountain, which is a sort of good type of flattening, so to speak. And so that's what's been driving sort of NII growth for us. And we do expect that, that will, together with the Fed, normalizing the balance sheet, ultimately end up with a higher long end of the rate. So we're pretty optimistic about that. You're right that at some point, typically, you would see potentially higher rates depending on the speed and inflation and other factors that would be -- precede the potential for a credit cycle. I mean, I suspect this will be no different, but that is not something that we see in our models or in our outlook over the near term. So hopefully, the monetary policy will be gradual, and as expected, and we'll continue to see the front-end raise and everything will be rational, and of course, there could be the prices, but at some point, yes, but not in the near future. Andrew Lim : Great. Could you say what the average maturity of your corporate loan book is or across the loan book in general? Marianne Lake : Yes, it differs. So it's shortened-- James Dimon : It's fairly disclosed in the 10-K but it's different for every single product and also changes in interest rates moving around. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : So on your tax Q&A, you mentioned what the impact of tax reform is across different businesses from a growth standpoint, but you also talked about the potential for competition being uncertain in terms of how it impacts different businesses and different products. Can you talk to that a little bit and speak to which products and businesses you see more scope for competition, less scope for competition? And how does that influence how you think about investing in -- across your different businesses? Marianne Lake : So I would start by saying that I think we showed at the Investor Day last year, and if were to do something similar, maybe we will, it would look very similar today, which is if you go below our top line businesses and the businesses beneath that, so the vast majority of our businesses are more than covering that cost of equity by a fair margin today. So our investment strategy, it wouldn't be directly impacted by marginal changes in pricing and profitability up or down. We're going to continue to invest in everything that we can do well to improve the customer experience and grow the business. So I think we've been pretty consistent on that, not just today but over the course of the last several years. And then I think it is uncertain. And so I would just give you the obvious extremes, which is, if you have four different organizations competing for a single large structure transaction and the cost of capital and taxes are direct input to pricing, I'm sure it will feature in the discussion. And if you are talking about a very, very scale, very, very high-volume business with extraordinarily high margins, it will probably have ultimately -- or at least in the very, very near term, less impact. But again, I actually think people will be quite disciplined how they think about this. James Dimon : And just to tell you an example away from finance. Utilities already are being put in a position because it's part of the rate base and after-tax return, but they're going to pass it on to consumers, probably 100%. That may be different by state but it either that way. And Marianne spoke about your cap rates and stocks, and obviously, anything in the marketplace have been bid at. In the after-tax rate, you could see a pretty quick effect. It will go all the way to Hershey candy bar. It's not necessarily clear that if you sell candy or cereals and like that, you'll going to have immediate repricing effect because of the tax rate changes. So we run a whole gamut of things. And so we have to wait and see how it works out. At the end of the day, everyone benefits from that growth. And to me that's probably the most important thing. Saul Martinez : Yes. No. That's helpful. One of the businesses that has been doing extraordinarily -- extremely well in terms of growth and profitability momentum is the Commercial Banking business, and I feel like I ask this every quarter, but I guess the question is what you can do for an encore. It's a relevant part of your earnings now and revenues and a big part of the growth. But can you just talk about to the sustainability of the momentum in terms of balance sheet growth, revenue growth, how much headway is there still to continue to grow in that business? James Dimon : Decades, Marianne already mentioned that we are now in the top 50 MSAs. We're already getting products and services. We built technology in cash management side. We're doing a better job serving U.S. middle-market companies for their international needs. It can go on for a long time. And we're more competitive. We got very good margins and the cost and investment. People have done a great job. We got specialty finance lines. So it's just more of the same. Marianne Lake : I think about the Commercial Bank is the absolute nexus of everything we do. It's delivering the whole company to our clients in a way that very few other people can do. And so we've been investing 100 banks in a year for a period of time, opening offices, adding capabilities, focusing on digital, improving the customer experience just like in the rest of our businesses. And so credit aside, where ultimately there will be a cycle and it will be fine. That business is really poised to do very well. James Dimon : Yes, and I'd just add to that, and we shouldn't leave this call without talking about it. In the custody, in fund services business, we got a great new technology. We've gained -- I think it looks like we've gained a little bit of share in the emerging markets where we are probably a little bit weak. Service levels have gone way up, and I'm embarrassed to say that we weren't particularly good a couple of years ago. In Treasury Services, we're bringing you a new international payment system. The banking is rebuilt in real-time has an overall value, the real-time payment business. What we've done with the -- we feel exceptional with the customer fund services. On the consumer side, we have a whole bunch of -- we look at our digital offerings, it's gone better and better and better. There's a whole bunch more coming. Zelle and QuickPay has done -- I mean, we're not gaining share, we're definitely gaining clients. And so we have barely tried to market that. That's where real-time P2P has opened -- I think our bank has probably now like 30 or 40, it's been eventually. Marianne Lake : Essentially everyone with a bank account. James Dimon : Everyone's going to be open up to Zelle and -- and then of course, this year, we have beta ready. We spoke a little bit about online sim mobile banking. And these -- some of these things will all work with really great products and services, and we're pretty excited about it actually. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just have one quick question on Securities Services. Within there you saw a good growth in your assets, on the custody up over 3% quarter-on-quarter on annualized but the revenues were up less than 1%. Could you -- were there some timing issues with when the AUC came on? And if you can kind of highlight what was the difference between AUC growth and revenue growth this quarter? Marianne Lake : Yes. So in Securities Services, we make money on NII, we make money on transactions, we make money on AUC. And depending upon whether that's fixed income or equities or whether it's emerging markets for the U.S., we'll drive the extent of that. So it's not like you can take the overall revenue of Securities Services and link it to increases in assets under custody and draw a direct -- I mean, there's obviously a direct relationship but it's not going to necessarily move in line. So I can tell you that looking at that decomposition of what time market levels and higher flows by region and looking at the portion of our revenues that's related to assets under custody that they were in line. James Dimon : The full year effect doesn't happen in 12 months. Marianne Lake : It is, exactly. James Dimon : If you even go up, they go up like $2 trillion and 2/3 of assets going up, but that will take a year before the full year effect of that stuff. So you see partial effect actually flowing into this quarter. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thanks, everyone. James Dimon : Thanks for joining us, yes. Happy New Year, everybody.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you operator and good morning everyone. And just to let you know that Jamie is actually on the ride with clients today, so he's not able to join us this morning, but sends his regards. So, now I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37, and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion, benefiting from broad based strength in performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality. So, this quarter's performance in context, on a core basis pretax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rate, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses. And even excluding the benefit of tax reform, net income was a clear record this quarter. Included in the results, you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due the adoption of a new accounting standard. These gains are reported in CIB markets revenue. Against that, there were a number of other smaller, but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserve, SBA, investment securities, and private equity losses and legal, which together substantially offset those gains. Underlined results continue to be strong. Average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 8% year-on-year, Card sales and merchant processing volumes up 12% and 15% respective. We maintained our number one rank in global IB fees and have net income of $1 billion in the Commercial Bank. And in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw strong long-term flows [ph] across all regions and 10% AUM growth. Turning to page two, some more details about the first quarter results. So, before we get into the numbers on the performance drivers for the quarter, I do want to remind you that there have been a couple of adjustments to the numbers on the page which are in line with the guidance that we gave during the fourth quarter. First, seeing the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. You will recall, this will have the full year impact of grossing up non-interest revenue and expense each by approximately $1.2 billion. The impact for the quarter of about $300 million is included here and prior periods have been similarly restated. Second, as a result of tax reform, certain tax equivalent adjustments that are included in managed revenue are lower on a relative basis and for that prior periods have not being restated. This impact which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50/50 in NII versus NIR, an offset in tax expense. So, with that, revenue of $28.5 billion was up $2.7 billion or 10% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments. Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation. Credit cost of $1.2 billion were down $150 million year-on-year. Consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter. In wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by single Oil & Gas names. You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix. We're expecting full year effective tax rate to be closer to 20%. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the first quarter with CET1 of 11.8%, down about 30 basis points versus last quarter. Capital generated was offset by net capital distributions and changes in AOCI. So, the reduction was driven by higher risk weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios. In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. But as you know, we can't provide any details of that at this stage. So, before moving on to the lines of business, on page four, I'll briefly address this week's new capital news. Two new capital NPRs were released this week, the Stress Capital Buffer and eSLR. Starting with the Stress Capital Buffer, the proposal was broadly in line with a narrative and expectations that had been set. There is a comment period, we intend to fully participate in the process and are encouraged that there is an openness from current leadership to really consider feedback from the industry. On the positive side, we support the convergence of Stress and BAU capital and in general, support simplification of the framework. We believe that firm should be required to hold adequate capital to withstand severe stress, calibrated to firm's specific exposures and risks. We also agree that many of the changes to the construct of the test, for example, not having to hold capital for full distributions during a stress environment, better reflect reality, and Board-approved policies. That said, stepping right back, if we are fundamentally reconsidering the contrast of minimum capital levels, then all of the building blocks should be in play including the GSIB surcharge to ensure they all hang together. And to reinforce points that we previously made, first and foremost, the fixed coefficients need to be recalibrated in light of the economic growth we've had. Second, the underlying premise for the surcharge and more particularly, U.S. gold plating is somewhat unnecessary for a firm that is compliant with all of the post-crisis reform that directly addresses systemic risks, which includes the severity of the CCAR stress, incorporating material GSIB specific instructions. Beyond that, obvious challenges with the current proposal includes the significant volatility and opacity in the said results, as well as challenges around implementation. So, getting to the numbers, you can see on the page, our estimated historical Stress Capital Buffer derived from the said result. And while for 2017, it would imply no impact on our minimum capital levels, you can see that in years prior, the buffer would have been higher. And you know that in 2018, the scenario was in many ways more severe and the lower tax rate has a net negative bias. Further there will potentially be a need for larger management buffers if it is necessary to accommodate significant volatility. So, acknowledging everything that we don't know, it's fair to say that our minimum level of capital including a management buffer would likely be higher under this proposal, but likely still in the range of 11% to 12%. Briefly on eSLR, as you know, we are not currently bound by leverage. I'm trying to say to you this proposal would reduce the eSLR minimum. So, my primary comment on this is to reiterate my earlier comments about the need to be willing to reexamine the GSIB surcharge regardless of the fact that it reduces the number. Overall, we've been waiting for these proposals and we look forward to participating in the comment process. Moving to page five and let's start with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $3.3 billion of net income and an ROE of 25%. Core loans are up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 13%, Business Banking up 7%, Card up 5%, and Auto loans and leases up 6%. Deposits grew solidly at 6% year-on-year. We believe we continue to outpace the industry, which as we previously noted, is experiencing a slowdown as consumers are increasing their allocations to investments, but also based upon our data, they appear to be spending more, reflecting a continued high level of confidence. Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter. And active mobile users were up double-digit. Revenue of $12.6 billion was up 15% year-on-year. Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home Lending revenue was roughly flat, as portfolio loan spread and production margin compression were predominantly offset by higher net servicing revenue. And Card, Merchant Services, and Auto revenue was up 18% including higher Auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion. The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter. Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investments in technology and marketing. Higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlined business growth. The overhead ratio of 55% was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite seasonally higher payroll taxes and higher marketing expenses. Finally, on credit, the trends across our portfolio remain favorable. Charge offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale. Turning to page six and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion and an ROE of 22%. This quarter in Banking, we maintained our number one ranking a global IBCs as well as a number one rank in North America and EMEA. IBCs were $1.7 billion, down 10% from a record quarter last year and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees. Advisory fees were up 15% year-on-year as we saw good momentum and some large deal closed. We ranked number one in global M&A wallet and gained share in every region. And for the quarter, we announce and completed more deals than any other bank. Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals. This quarter we ranked number three in a very competitive environment. And debt underwriting fees were down 18%, driven by a slow start to the year, primarily due to increased market volatility which reduced issuance. Despite these headwinds, we maintained our number one ranking globally and looking forward to the rest of the year, across products, the overall pipeline remains strong. Moving onto market, total markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year reported. However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year. Accounting for both of these items market revenues would have been up about 7%. Fixed income market's adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance. It was a record quarter for equities and revenue was up 25%. A well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives. In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continue client activity driving growth in prime as the investments that we've made the business are paying off. Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16% respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. Security Services also benefited from asset based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity. Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense with a comp-to-revenue ratio of 29% and the remainder primarily driven by higher transaction costs in markets. Moving to Commercial Banking on page seven. Another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII as we continue to benefit from higher rates, partially offset by lower IB revenues. Sequentially, revenue was down 8%, largely driven by the impact of tax reform. Gross IB revenues of $569 million result 15% year-on-year on a lower overall industry wallet and fewer large transactions versus last year. That said, the underlying flow of business remains robust. In fact, it was a record quarter for middle market clients and the pipeline looked strong. Expense of $844 million was up year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and technology. Loan balances were up 6% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 5% on strength in our expansion markets as well as specialized industries, but down 1% sequentially roughly in line with the industry. CRE loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter as the competition is significantly elevated. So both, while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline. Finally, credit performance continues to be very good with zero net charge offs this quarter. Moving onto Asset & Wealth Management on page eight, Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $770 million with a pretax margin of 26% and an ROE of 34%. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth. Expense of $2.6 billion was down year-on-year as the first quarter of last year included nearly $400 million of legal expenses. Adjusted expense would have been up 8%, driven by higher external fees and revenues as well as higher compensation. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion including $5 billion in active equities with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance. We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impacts of cash repatriation due to tax reform. AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively on high market levels globally as well as net inflows. Deposits were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting the migration into investments which we previously discussed, but were about flat sequentially on seasonally higher balances. Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in both mortgage as well as other loans globally. Moving to page nine and Corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $383 million. The net loss of $1.87 million in treasury and CIO was primarily due to losses related to security sales. The net loss of $196 million in other Corporate reflects approximately $100 million after-tax loss on legacy private equity investments, as well as a net tax expense on adjustments and true-up of certain reserves. And you'll recall that last year included a legal benefit and our quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform. Finally, turning the page 10. Given Investor Day is only six weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year 2018. So, to wrap-up, we are pleased with the firm's performance this quarter with all of our businesses showing continued and broad strength in an overall environment that remains supportive. And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into topline growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double-digits year-on-year. So, with that operator, we can take some questions. Operator : Certainly ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning Marianne. Wanted to talk about LIBOR, we saw big increase this quarter, can you remind us how LIBOR affects you, kind of pros and cons, where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side and where do you have it on the funding cost sensitivity to LIBOR? And how should we think net-net about that? Marianne Lake : Yes. Okay, so I'll sort of end with the op shop [ph] which is that net-net the impact to our results in the quarter was very modest positive. So, a pretty small number on the positive direction. And we've actually seen this before, I can't remember, a year or so ago, we are most sensitive as you know to the front-end of rate, but principally to IOER and prime. So, while we do have exposure to LIBOR repricing, it's both on the asset and liability. As you mentioned, we also have combination of one month and three months LIBOR. So, if you look sort of next across the assets and liability side, they material offset, we don't have sort of significant mismatches. And so as a consequence, obviously, we benefit from a higher level of obsolete short rate, but the basis widening hasn't been very meaningful to our NII. And I mean examples of asset that we price of LIBOR be the Commercial Banking loans and obviously, unhedged or hedged long-term debt on the liability side. John McDonald : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, wondering about the drivers of the 7% expected growth in fee income for this year. At Investor Day, you mentioned you've got some bounce back from headwinds in Card and markets, but also core growth of -- I think about $2.5 billion you mentioned. So, what are the drivers of that overall 7% fee income if you could just give us some color there that would be great? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, let's start with sort of three relatively big drivers. So, yes, as we have now sort of latched big Sapphire reserves and high premium vintages, our net acquisition costs are substantially lower and so that is a tailwind. We are seeing regular way BAU growth in Cards, NIR, and -- sort of drivers. Similarly, mark-to-markets as we talked about after the first quarter performance that's a driver and then as the ongoing sort of growth in the Auto lease income space which is significant. Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the Board in terms of new accounts and debit trends in Card sales and Asset Management fees as a driver too, so there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the -- somewhat tailwind of Card and market, both in the trading and in the Asset Management base. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Marianne Lake : Hey Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello. There's a comment in the prepared text on -- in Lending and Commercial banking being intensely competitive and led to no real growth. Yet, I saw your -- the comments about 5% and 7% C&I growth and CRE growth, so I wonder if you could just flush that out a little bit more about the competitive landscape and I guess that's a pricing issue mostly? Marianne Lake : Yes, I'll start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefits from our investment and expansion markets and also as you know we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of first term lending and so, for a period of time in both of those bases, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers. Quarter-over-quarter -- and the trouble with C&I loans is there can also be some volatility associated with held-to-sell mortgage portfolio, seasonality -- sorry mortgage warehouse seasonality and stuff like that. So, quarter-over-quarter what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle, but we're not expecting flat for the year, we're expecting growth in the mid-single-digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand. And in the CTL space and commercial real estate [ph] more generally that's where the competition really has stepped up very significantly and that really is where pricing has become fiercely competitive and that's in compression. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. And I just want to quick follow-up on your other comments related to capital proposals. The simple question I have is hearing you loud and clear on the -- on everything related to risk based capital, but the clear improvement on the leverage side in the SLR, does that -- theoretically I know that's just a proposal right now, would that theoretically free up more activity in repo land and other short-term investments that soak-up leverage capital but not risk -- much risk-based capital? Marianne Lake : So, generally across the -- sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but remember for us that we haven't been constrained by leverage -- Tier 1 leverage or SLR over the last -- over the last several years. And it's a result obviously of the business mix we have and operating model that we have that we can socialize some of our [Indiscernible] results across the company and so we wouldn't expect there are the hedges [ph] and change materially. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Hi. Marianne Lake : Hi. Michael Mayo : Can you just give a little bit more of your expectations for consumer and specifically digital banking? The active online users were up 5% year-over-year, but for the quarter, it was up 12% annualized. And I know there's always risk in annualizing numbers, so is that change in online users seasonal or is it structural, just a little more color on that? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, I'll give you my best thought. I would say it's a little bit more structural than it is seasonal and we've been seeing continued growth in both digital and especially, the mobile channels. And it's a lot to do with adding features and as we talked about at Investor Day, making it compelling for people to digitally move money, which makes them become much more engaged in all of the good things that come with that. In addition we talked also I think at Investor Day about the fact that we've recently added digital account opening and so I couldn't give you exact amounts of what is driving -- which ones of those is driving what, but we would continue to expect a bit of a structural acceleration. Certainly we hope for that. Michael Mayo : And then a follow-up on that. So, is this money stickier or not? And if you could elaborate more on the deposit base, I know you've been pretty cautious in saying that money could flee more easily because of the digital it goes, on other hands, does it become more sticky because you have these connections? Marianne Lake : Yes, so I think we sort of talked about the fact that -- I did think those customers are more loyal that they spend more and they bring up more deposits in investment. So, we gave you the stat -- that I think at Investor Day, we see more Card spend both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investment, so digitally active customers. So, overall, it's really good for our franchise to have these customers engaged and we hope they also use our branches by the way. With respect to deposit status, we talked before about the two theses. The first which is the one that we generally subscribe to is that a combination of the ability to use technology, the transparency, and expectation of higher rates as well as potentially overtime, the value of retail deposits the liquidity that we would expect higher reprice. And we haven't changed our expectation on that, but we haven't seen it yet either. So, we're going to have to watch that maybe play out. There is the other side of that argument that other people -- many people subscribe to which is the customer experience, investments, the convenience, the brand, the marketing, the digital features, the products and services, the reward, all become increasingly important and customers are less price-sensitive. So, I guess we'll all know it when it finally unfolds. As you know we could have taken a little bit more of a conservative view but where we are right now in the normalization cycle specifically, sort of retail, checking, and savings, as you know we haven't yet seen that unfold. We have seen migration in Asset, Wealth Management balances and that to be expected to be a leading indicator. So, this will unfold over the course of the next year or so. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Marianne Lake : Hey Matt. Matthew O'Connor: Hi, good morning. Can you provide an update on your interest rate sensitivity with the recent move in rates that we've had? Marianne Lake : I'm sorry, say again. Matthew O'Connor: Just an update on your interest rate sensitivity from here? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, we've seen two things happen. I guess we've seen obviously we've rolled forward a quarter. I think our earnings at risk disclose at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion, you go forward a quarter and that comes down a little less sort of realized rate benefit, but we've also seen as you know somewhere in the sort of mid 40s basis point increase in rates sort of front and long end which will also have a somewhat significant impact. So, $1.7 billion will be down quite meaningfully I would expect at the end of the third quarter, but you'll see those disclosures in our Q. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately within the trading businesses not a surprise there's a big increase in the average VAR, obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the number of products out there or the markets out there. But just anyway to think about like how much the VAR increased? And you had some increase in trading revenues, but maybe not as much as one would think when you see the VAR that much, is there any correlation between those two from [Indiscernible] point of view? Marianne Lake : Yes, I think it's extremely difficult to draw a straight line between VAR and all of its complexities and revenues in any one quarter. And if I just sort of unpick it for you first -- and by the way, just to reiterate that it's still at relatively low levels relative to historical norms when we've been in more normal trading environments with higher levels of volatility and inventory and the like. So, I would handpick and say of the increase more than half was related to volatility and obviously some of the volatility was somewhat significant, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue see periods or episodes of significant volatility and a bit less than half to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB any sort of balance sheet wants to go up and risk weighted assets and so on. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Marianne Lake : Hi Erika. Erika Najarian : Morning. So, my first question to you Marianne is if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CET1 minimum that could move year-to-year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, I mean I would start a little bit with -- so when you say as return, if you take the last years Stress Capital Buffer, you've seen this from history for us that that could be significant. So, there are three observations I would have. The first is when we think about capital planning, I think rightly you would expect us and we do think about over more than a one year cycle and while we have very significant earnings capacity, we don't want to be sort of up and down and sideways and [Indiscernible]. So, I think there will be some implications of the potential for volatility in the calibration of management buffers. And so whether it's in higher or lower SCB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we aren\u2019t caught sideways from a test result that is with respect once a year and a little bit opaque. The second thing I would highlight to you is for what it's worth, you saw our Investor Day sort of, I won't say guidance, but no sort of indication that we were -- we would expect to try and pay out around 100% off of minus. And you see our ratios are below 12%. So, I think that puts us on reasonably solid booking regardless of the precision of it to sort of understand how the rules play out. Finally, I hope and I believe, I suspect that through the comment period, the implications of volatility will be properly explored and that hopefully there will be some sort of mechanism considered to accommodate smooth or otherwise allow for things not to be [Indiscernible] around based upon the specificity of the test. And margin, I guess, the fourth point, it's not something that we overthink is having the full course of dividend explicitly included notwithstanding that this cap [ph] is listed kind of makes it dollar-to-dollar capital. So, at the margin, I guess that makes people think carefully, but we would still want to pay out a strong healthy dividend on growing earnings. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up to your response to Glenn's question on SLR. I think there was some excitement from your investors if you look at your 4Q banking sub SLR, I think it was 6.7% off of a 6% minimum and that would clearly go to 4.75%. But just to make sure I understood your response even if you could add low risk weight exposure according to that constraint that leverage exposure feeds into the size component of the GSIB surcharge calculation. And so for there to be more freed balance sheet, you also really need to recalibrate the GSIB surcharge. Did they get that? Marianne Lake : Yes, I mean that's definitely one of the factors. But just the other sort of slightly first order factor is we're running 70 basis points above our minimum. So, if you reduce the minimum by another 100 or 200 basis points whatever the number is, we already had excess capacity. And so when we think about the use of our resources, we obviously think about to maximize SCA [ph]. And so we haven't felt extraordinarily constrained I would say. So, there's that kind of just sort of basic, we haven't been maybe as constrained as maybe others have seen and that is what it is. And so while we'll continue to make every decision incrementally based upon marginal SCA, but you are right. You have to take into consideration all the local impacts, I mean our stock price alone impacts GSIB. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning Marianne Marianne Lake : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Question on LIBOR, I know you discussed it relative to the loan book, I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how the LIBOR changes impacted trading? Marianne Lake : Yes, so look, I would say that in the fixed income spaces was sort of discussion and it was a feature or a factor and even in equities, to be honest, it was part of the discussions. I wouldn't say that we could point to it materially impacting our failing results. Betsy Graseck : And then the follow-up is just on the mark-to-market gains that you called out the $505 million [ph]. It looks to me like you've called it out as mark-to-market gains on certain equity investments. I just wanted to understand why it's really showing up in fixed income instead of equity trading line, is that the correct interpretation of the slide? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, think about -- many of these investments are years old -- many years old. And think about them as strategic investments that relate to business activity. For example, if illustratively in financial market infrastructure or clearing and houses or exchanges or so on, all sales and strategic investment potentially related to other parts of the business, so it just happens to be the case that those investments years ago relate and continue to relate to fixed income more than equities. And they were previously ahead of cost, and as there are observable prices as you know this quarter we have to reflect that. Operator : Our next question-- Marianne Lake : Pretty [Indiscernible] with the investment. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Hey good morning. Maybe just a question on the TCGA [ph], I know that we're all wondering if it's going to have an impact on loan growth, but what about credit, do you think that that has any positive impact, I guess, particularly on the Corporate side with higher cash flows going forward lower tax rate. How do you think about reserving and your expected loss rates going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes, I would say across the Board actually all the way from full business to middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings more free cash and generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio. And we will only really see that come through as we get financials and see that in the financials and label to reflect that in our internal ratings. But we would expect to see some positive lift as a result of that over time. So, no doubt that helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment and it looks pluses and minuses, but yes, it's a tailwind to credit overall. James Mitchell : Right, okay. Thanks. And then maybe just following up on asset yields, you saw overall asset yields jump pretty nicely given the higher rate environment, but securities portfolio yields were down, is that sort of a shortening duration or just a mix issue, what shouldn\u2019t we expect security sales people moving higher in this environment? Marianne Lake : Yes you should. What it is actually is the tax equivalent adjustments I mentioned. So, you're seeing that sort of relative impact of lower tax gross-ups and meaning portfolio and investment securities, if you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Hey Marianne you mentioned that on the consumer side, you had no incremental reserving actions and I'm wondering if you can just kind of give us a state of the consumer to that extent is -- are you feeling just better or was it also related to kind of just the growth math starting to look a little bit better in Card and Auto? Marianne Lake : So, I would say we still feel really good about the consumer, really good. And so while you can look at sort of overall sort of levels of consumer indebtedness and look at the fact that they've reached the peak and student lending is driving that in a large part. It's also clearly the case that people had a long time to prepare their balance sheets and term out debt at lower rates and become more liquid and so sort of debt service burdens are still manageable. And so over -- and confidence is high and that should be a benefit generally speaking. So, overall, we still feel pretty good and it's showing a little bit in our sort of consumer spend data where we're seeing that confidence continues to sort of a spur a bit in spending. With respect to reserves, so our expectation and our belief about the strength of consumer continues to be optimistic. And then further, of course, you know that our portfolio particularly is skewed towards higher quality credit. And so we aren't seeing any signs of fragility or deterioration across the portfolios across the Board. So, hope you get it. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. And on my follow-up, the Card revenue rate was nice to see it really spike up 11.6% and you guys have been talking about getting it to 11.25% by mid-year. Any updated thoughts on just that trajectory and where you expect that to go over time now? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I mean much like we talked about with the Card charge off, right, there is some seasonality. So, the first quarter revenue rate would normally be seasonally higher. Having said that, you're right, we did see some revenue outperformance in the Card space a little bit. And so at this point if you were to ask me 11.25, well, it's it certainly a very, very solid expectation, probably higher for the year. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Marianne Lake : Hi. Operator : Mr. Martinez, your line is open. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hello. Can you hear me? Marianne Lake : Yes, we can hear. Saul Martinez : Could you hear me? I'm sorry about that. Sorry little scattered this morning, I have a lot going on. But -- yes, I apologize if you already addressed this question Marianne. But -- can you just talk to the -- how you're feeling about the pipeline in investment banking, obviously it was a little bit of a soft quarter for you and for everybody. And just how are you thinking about the pipeline deal activity in light of Daniels, I think Daniels' guidance at the Investor Day, your expectation is that Advisory and ECM might be up a little bit, ECM down a little bit, I don't know if you guys have any updated thoughts on the outlook? Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean I just -- first of all, I would just talk a tiny bit about the quarter because I think it's important and it's instructive. First of all, last quarter was a -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to [Indiscernible] I still feel like we did pretty well and it's a little bit like the fixed income story last year, equity market in DCM was up and M&A was less strong in this year that turned around and I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under indexed for the larger fee event for a combination of reasons; some outside of our control and some addressable and also some deals that we had hoped to have closed moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually if you look across the Board, M&A still look strong, DCM and ECM pipeline also looks strong. Overall, the pipeline is well ahead of this time last year. So, as long as the market remains constructive, we should continue to see reasonable momentum across products, but as you say, the [Indiscernible] M&A and equities likely to benefit more strongly than DCM in a rate rise environment. And so confidence is strong, activity levels, you saw volumes are up. We printed number one M&A quarter. So, as long as market volatility regularity given is gone certainty, doesn't escalate within any pretty good about the second quarter and into the year. Saul Martinez : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning Marianne. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Can you give us any color on when you look at your franchise -- your consumer franchise, is there parts of the country that are more competitive for deposits, whether that's metro New York versus California versus Texas? And could you give us some color on what you guys are seeing geographically on deposit growth in the competition? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I mean I'll make to some [Indiscernible] comments and if you still have questions, you can maybe speak to IR, because I don't have everything in front of me. But I will tell you this we compete with everyone across the Board. We compete with the large money center banks, we compete with the regional banks, with local banks, and so there's plenty of competition in all markets and we monitor the market dynamics as you'd say, a pretty granular level and so we will respond accordingly. And I think we do pretty well across the Board and I wouldn't call anyone out as standing out all, anyone out as a clearly being more challenging, but that's an ongoing sort of interesting dynamic process. So, we compete -- everywhere we compete, we compete with a lot of people who want these high quality liquidity products -- relationships and so do we. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And I apologize if you addressed this; I had to jump off the call for a minute. The deposit beta, where does it stand today for you folks? And on your Investor Day, you gave us a very good trajectory of where you think it's going to. Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, with deposit betas, you have to sort of take the because there's a sort of full spectrum. We are, as an industry, firmly on a reprice journey. No doubt. And so the state of play and the maturity of that reprice journey depends upon the specifics of the business and the client. And so at the wholesale sort of top end reprice is really reasonably high. Not to say that there's nowhere left to go, but it's reasonably high and pretty consistent. And as you go down through into the middle market space and small business and all the way down to the retail space, it's still relatively early days given the absolute level of rates. And so we continue to see the journey. As I said we've seen migrations in [Indiscernible] now for few quarters. As people are sort of reassessing deposits versus investments, we're retaining those investments. So, we feel good about that. But that is generally a precursor to what we will see in retail at some point in future and not yet. So, with respect the final part of your question which was are we still feeling like the trajectory we showed you is our central case and the answer is yes at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : Yes, good morning. You touched on this in a tangential way, but let me ask it a different way. If we look at your Card fees on a consolidated basis back in 2014, 2015 before you had the Sapphire launch, it was running around $1.5 billion a quarter, it bottomed out late 2016 and early 2017 at $900 million and now you're up to $1.275 billion. Should we expect -- as Sapphire completely mature, should we expect that to go back to the $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a quarter or is that ancient history and not indicative of anything? Marianne Lake : So, I can't really comment on dollars, I'll tell two things. The first is that we've given you -- so to 2018, our expectation of the revenue rate that will be now likely above the 11.25% we previously said. I will tell you we are largely we have lacked, we have lacked the Sapphire reserve quarters now, right, so the big quarter is the hundred, thousand, point premium quarters, those were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter -- the fourth quarter of 2016, the first quarter of last year. So, I would call that in the rearview mirror now and from here, we grow with the growth in the accounts and the businesses and the spend. So, we still expect to grow. But remember also in that rebase lining and I can't remember which period you called out, but also remember we have gone through a whole renegotiation of all our Card co-brand relationships that have an impact. So, growth will be an offset. We've had some structural stepdown for the reprice of the co-brand, there's still great partnerships and we consider it very valuable. Sapphire we're lacked and from here, hopefully we just continue to grow. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC. Al Alevizakos : Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering equities clearly was strong in the quarter, but I was wondering if you could give us some geographical split. I'm particularly interested since I'm based in Europe to see if you witnessed any impact from the new regulation especially MiFID II in either cash or derivatives? Thank you. Marianne Lake : Sure. So, let me just start like at the top of the house and say we've been talking about globally investing in bankers and sales people and technology and building out our platforms across cash and prime space. It is the case because we were not competitive in the international synthetic prime years ago and we now have among best-in-class sort of platform that that has been part of the growth drivers, I would say EMEA, international primers has been a bright spot, generally MiFID II. So, I would say that there was a concern about pullback in trading. We saw a bit of hesitation, particularly as in fixed income, less so in equities, but the market was generally be quite resilient and so we're still only relatively early days. And within the result that we had articulated to you, we've seen material increases in EMEA electronic trading, which we think will be likely somewhat permanent where people are choosing to do high touch cash trading, we're seeing some concentration among players which is all to say that we are seeing the industry wallet decline and margins compressed, but for us in particular, we're also benefiting from higher volumes. We think we're gaining share and we're benefiting from some of that concentration among top players. So, net-net, yes, I think we're seeing some pressure on the in scope wallet, but less so than you would think for us and its early days, but we'll just have to keep watching it. Al Alevizakos : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Okay thank you guys. Thanks very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion and EPS of $2.29 on revenue of $28.4 billion, all were record for the second quarter, even exceeding the benefit of tax reform. Our return on tangible common equity was 17%. And also included in the results were two notable items, which I will call out in a momentum, excluding which EPS would have been about $0.10 higher. The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses and highlights include average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year-on-year, consumer deposit growth of 5% which we believe continues to outpace the industry; card sales up 11%; and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes, each up 12%. We maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and CIB delivered double-digit revenue growth across the board. Commercial bank revenue was up 11% year-on-year with IB revenues being a bright spot this quarter. And in asset and wealth management, AUM and client assets were both up 8%. Turning to page two for more details about the second quarter. The firm delivered strong core positive operating leverage this quarter. Revenue of $28.4 billion was up $1.7 billion or 6 % year-over-year. Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower market NII. Net interest revenue was up over $600 million, driven by strong performance in markets and IB fees and also higher auto lease income. NII this quarter was negatively impacted by a rewards liability adjustment in cards. And remember that last year included a significant legal benefit. Excluding these two items, NII would have been up $1.6 billion and total revenue up 10%. Expense of $16 billion was up 8% year-on-year, with half of the increase directly related to incremental revenues, principally compensation in the CIB, transaction expenses and auto lease growth. About a third related to continued investments in technologies as well as headcount across the businesses and the remainder was largely a loss on the liquidation of a legacy legal entity as part of our simplifications efforts. And if you exclusive this item, expense was up only 7%. The legal entity loss, together with the rewards liability adjustment in cards are the two notable items I mentioned at the beginning for a total reduction of over $500 million pre-tax. Credit costs of $1.2 billion were flat year-on-year and credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale. Shifting to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the second quarter with CET1 of 11.9%, up about 10 basis points versus the last quarter as most of the capital generated was returned to shareholders. Risk weighted assets were relatively flat, despite solid growth in loans and commitments, being offset across other categories. In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.6 billion of capital to shareholders and last month the fed informed that they did not object to our 2018 capital plan. We were pleased to announce gross repurchase capacity of nearly $21 billion over the next four quarters and the Board announced its intention to increase our common dividend to $0.80 per share affected in the third quarter. Moving on to page four on consumer and community banking. CCB generated $3.4 billion of net income and an ROE of 26%. Core loans were up 7% year-on-year driven by home lending up 12%, business banking up 6%, card up 4%, and auto loans and leases also up 4%. Deposits grew 5%. And although growth is slower than a year ago, we are seeing record high retention rates and customer satisfaction scores. Client investment assets were up 12% with more than half of the growth from net new money flows and we are capturing an outsized share as our customers shift from deposit to investments. Card sales volume was up 11%. And we announced several new cards as we continue to update our product offering. Revenue of $12.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year. Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth. Our lending revenue was down 6% on production margin compression and lower net servicing revenue, despite higher purchase volume in retail. And cards merchant services and auto revenue was up 6% driven by lower card acquisition costs, higher card NII on margin expansion as well as loan growth, as well as higher auto lease volumes. This was largely offset by lower net interchange, driven by a rewards liability adjustment of about $330 million, reflecting strong customer engagement across our Ultimate Rewards offering. As a result, the card revenue rate was 10.4% for the quarter, but our full year guidance of approximately 11.25% holds. Expense of $6.9 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher auto lease depreciation and investments in technology. Finally, on credit. Charge-offs were down $36 million year-on-year, including a recovery of about $130 million from a loan sale in home lending. This was largely offset by higher net charge-offs in card. The card charge-off rate was 3.27%, reflecting seasonality and is in line with expectations and in line with our guidance. There were no reserve actions taken this quarter. Turning to page five and the corporate and investment bank. CIB reported net income of $3.2 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion, up 11% and an ROE of 17%. In banking, we maintained our number one ranking for the quarter and year-to-date in Global IB fees and with a record first half performance, and we grew share across the regions. IB revenue of $1.9 billion was up 13% year-on-year, outperforming the market but was down slightly as we saw robust activity, particularly in M&A and ECM. It was a record second quarter for advisory fees, which were up 24%, benefiting from a number of large deals closings this quarter. We gained share and ranked number two globally. Equity underwriting fees were up 49%. We ranked number one globally as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share in a competitive environment, driven by IPOs and convertibles in the two most active sectors, healthcare and technology, which are areas of strength for us. Additionally, we saw good momentum in private capital market as clients are exploring alternative sources of capital. And debt underwriting fees were relatively flat versus a very strong prior quarter, supported by healthy acquisition related activity. And we ranked number one in DCMs globally and across all the products. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong. Moving on to market. Total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance across categories and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter. Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the back of good client flow and decent volatility and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year. It was a record second quarter for equities with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime and flow derivatives. Treasury services and securities services revenues were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels. Finally, expense of $5.4 billion was up 11%, driven by higher performance-related compensation, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. The comp-to-revenue ratios for the quarter were 27%, consistent with prior quarter. Moving to commercial banking on page six. Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was a record for second quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII and strong investment banking activity. Gross IB revenue of $739 million was up 39%, driven by several large transactions and strong underlying flow of business and the overall pipeline is robust and active. Expense of $844 million was up 7% as we continue to invest in the business, both in bankers and in technology. Loan balances were up4% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. C&I loans were up 3% year-on-year and sequentially due to increased M&A related financing with strengths in our expansion markets as well as in specialized industries, and despite lower tax exempt activity. CRE loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat versus last year as there continues to be a lot of completion for high quality assets and we are selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points. Moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $755 million with a pretax margin of 28% and an ROE of 33%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year-over-year driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi assets, equities and alternatives, partly offset by outflows in fixed income. Additionally, we saw net liquidity inflows of $17 billion. AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were both up 8% with the increase being split about equally between flows and higher market levels globally. Deposits were down 7% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investment where we are also capturing the vast majority and down 3% sequentially on seasonal tax payments. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $136 million. The result included a pretax $174 million loss on a liquidation of a legacy legal entity, previously mentioned. But it\u2019s of note that while this loss through expense affects retained earnings this quarter, it is offset from a capital perspective. So, it\u2019s capital neutral. Before I wrap up, you may note, we have no outlook page here. Although both revenue and expense are trending higher market-related, given we\u2019re only halfway through the year, we\u2019re not updating our outlook at this point. So, to close, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be supportive. Consumer and business confidence and sentiment remain high, client activity levels are robust, and the markets are open and active. We are pleased with the firm\u2019s results this quarter. Our broad-based financial performance clearly demonstrates the power of the platform. Revenue grew strongly, double digits year-over-year in many cases. We realized positive core operating leverage, despite significant investments and credit trends remain favorable across both consumer and wholesale. This was a clear record for second quarter, whichever way you slice it. We remain focused on consistently delivering for our customers and our communities and investing for the long term. With that, operator, can you open up the line for Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey. Good morning, Marianne. Can I ask you to talk a little bit about the card business? And you mentioned the strong customer engagement with regards to the rewards markdown. Can you just walk us through what\u2019s the drivers of that and this is a one-time event and does it affect the card revenue rate outlook? Marianne Lake : So, I\u2019ll start with the end because that\u2019s pretty simple. It obviously affected the card revenue out in the quarter. You can see that that was 10.4%. And you can see on the page, we\u2019ve adopted for the impact. But, the 11.25% for the year remains true, which is to say that while this may be slightly larger than normal, it\u2019s not exactly one-time item. We regularly review our liability as we observe the mix of our portfolio and the behaviors of our customers. On face value, I know rewards is often talked about as a competitive matter. I mean, this is less about competition per se. In fact, we have record low in sales attrition, which in a competitive environment is really very good. And it\u2019s more about customers awareness of the value proposition of rewards and them being engaged in redeeming them, which for us is a positive thing because engaged customers spend more and we\u2019re seeing that they attrite less, and we\u2019re seeing that. And they will bring us more deposits and investments as we deeper relationships. So, I would say it\u2019s a little larger than normal. We do it pretty regularly. So, it\u2019s not one-time but it\u2019s not completely typical. Ken Usdin : Got it. And in the press release, Jamie mentioned the first paragraph about increasing competition. Is that a global across all businesses comment or are you seeing it now really in specific areas? Thanks. Marianne Lake : Okay. I think it\u2019s -- I mean it\u2019s pretty global across all businesses, as a general matter, and there are some obvious areas where it\u2019s pretty acute. And in the retail also space for example, we talked about commercial real estate for example, mortgage clearly with capacity and the systems for example, all of those areas are pretty competitive for a variety of reasons given where we are in the cycle in the economy and like. But I would say broad based, it\u2019s everywhere. That said, we are holding our own and in many cases gaining share. So, we\u2019re doing pretty well. Operator : Our next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, Marianne. I wanted to ask you what you are seeing this quarter in terms of customer deposit trends, a little more color on both the pricing beta and volume balances. Kind of wondering, if you are seeing a lot of competition from the online competitors like Marcus and whether those are affecting your deposit balances with consumers being attracted towards high yields and affecting your pricing decisions? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, I would say -- you talked to consumer deposits, so, I am talking retail now, not the sort of high net worth, but I\u2019ll come back to that. Consumer deposit up 5% year-on-year, slowing down as we would have expected, while you have seen online competitors and even some regional competitors make some moves in the large bank space, we haven\u2019t really seen that yet. When we look at the deposit slowdown and we unpack it, it feels to us like the vast majority of the root cause is customers moving into investments. And in the case of regional customers, that seem to manage accounts. So, it doesn\u2019t even appear to be rate seeking. Spending more would be the second driver and to a much lesser extent are we seeing behaviors like the rate seeking at this point. So, we\u2019re not seeing that kind of migration out of the Company to online or other competitors at this point. And so, at this point, reprice is still not happening. That said, we are on a journey clearly. And in the higher net worth space, we continue to see the migration into investment assets we\u2019ve been seeing. And again we continue to recapture the vast majority of those. So, at this point, things are playing out as we would have expected and we\u2019re not actually losing deposits en masse to any third parties. John McDonald : Okay. And just a follow-up on that. Can you remind us what\u2019s the opportunity you see with the rollout of Finn and what advantages you expect to have in that arena? Marianne Lake : So, I would look at Finn as one of many sort of digital innovations that we\u2019re doing, and I would look at it also in conjunction with broader, digital account opening. And although we\u2019ve now launched Finn nationwide, I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s still very nascent and we\u2019re still learning. So, we\u2019re going to continue to advance -- and it\u2019s got very high net promoter score by the way. So, customer experience is good. But it\u2019s still quite young. Jamie Dimon : We haven\u2019t really marketed\u2026 Marianne Lake : So, we\u2019re just starting. I would say, digital account opening on the other hand is a pretty good success story. And we are seeing a lot more accounts opened digitally across the channels and we\u2019re seeing of those, a decent chunk of net new to bank. And where we\u2019re seeing existing customers open new accounts, we\u2019re getting incremental money. So, we are seeing our digital asset pay off and even more broadly than that we could go into quick payments and the like. But, I wouldn\u2019t focus overly on Finn as an eye focusing but think digital more broadly. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit about loan growth. Obviously, it seems to have picked up in the fed data over the last month or two. What are you guys seeing on the ground? And do you think it\u2019s -- what we\u2019ve seen so far is a good indicator for maybe a more sustained pickup in growth? Marianne Lake : Yes. I would say that we would use the commercial bank C&I loans as kind of bellwether. There has been decent demand. And I mentioned it in my remarks, the decent demands, not exclusively but partly on the back of a very robust and active M&A environment. And so, the demand is there, I would say, growth is solid, and in line with our expectations we will continue to hope to see that growth as we go through the year. And there may be other tailwinds. We\u2019ve yet to see the full effect of tax reform flow through in profitability and free cash flow. And so, I would characterize loan growth as solid and our expectations for the outlook to remain solid, benefitting from very active capital markets environment. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, when we think about NIM going forward, I mean, I think it was a couple of years ago that you talked about maybe normalized being somewhat the 265 to 275 range or 246 now. Is there a certain loan to deposit ratio you think you need to have, or level of rate? How would you -- just trying to think through how we think about NIM going forward? Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean we\u2019re at -- fed funds of 125 to 200 right now, but we are not anywhere yet close to normal rates. And so, when we think about what you talk about normalizing NIM, we are thinking about it more through the cycle adjusting for new liquidity rules and everything else. So, we have a number of further rate hikes to go before we reach that point. But, we are on a core basis -- and remember, we have a fairly sizeable market balance sheet, but on a core basis we are continuing to see NIM expansion in line with expectations and moving up towards that. So, we would expect to see expansion year-over-year moving towards that level but not getting there yet. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My question is on the regulatory process this year under the new leadership. I am wondering if there\u2019s anything that you could share with us that you\u2019ve observed in terms of change. Whether or not it was -- how receptive or not the regulators were during the comment period for the SEB and also during the CCAR process? Was there any marked or observable change in the processes this year versus previous years? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say on the commentary of the SEB, obviously during the comment period, the regulators are quiet. So, it wasn\u2019t a two-way dialogue during that period. We would expect the two-way dialogue to start now that the comment period is over and the industry and bilateral letters have been submitted. I will say, going back to comments I think I\u2019ve made previously that I remain constructive about the willingness for the current leadership to pay attention and take on those comments. And if you look at the proposal that was sent out for comments, not only did it have a large number of questions that they were asking the feedback on but their actual proposal was very similar to what we have been understanding was the intention in speeches that go back a fair way, which is to say that it feels like we\u2019re still making the sausage rather than this is a done deal. And so we\u2019re very optimistic that the comments will be taken on board. And they are -- volatility was evident in spades in this test, opaqueness, GSIB. We can go through them, I am sure we will. So, we remain optimistic that the comments -- bilateral discussions will start now. I would say -- the industry discussions will start now. I would say on CCAR, it felt close to prior years. It not to say that it is not constructive, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s not like basically as prior years. Erika Najarian : And just my follow-up question is, the pushback that I am getting from a lot of investors on bank stocks is that we are long in the tooth in the economic cycle. Clearly, there is strong activity levels that you posted this quarter and the credit metrics that you posted would suggest otherwise. And I am wondering, both Jamie and Marianne, how you would respond to that pushback that now it\u2019s not the time to invest in banks because we are late in the game from an economic standpoint? Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean, I would say two things, which is while this cycle is older than potentially typically cycles have been, growth over the last decade has been lower through the recovery. So, there is plenty potentially of room to play. And as we look at all the economic data, not just here in the U.S. but also globally, there are no real signs of fragility. And I know, people are staring at the flat yield curve and we would say that that flat yield curve is a bear flattening, good flattening compared to profitability perspective and not some looming risk of a recession embedded in it. So, I am saying it\u2019s still negative. Real policy rate is still at zero, credit is very benign. That said, we are in cyclical businesses, no doubt. And so, we are preparing and we will be ready when the cycle turns and no doubt there will be impact from that. But through the cycle, I think we\u2019ve proven our business model will produce strong shareholder returns and among best-in-class performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : I wanted to follow up on that last question, if Jamie could respond to. I mean, Marianne, you said the macro is very supportive, you sound very positive. On the other hand, the 10-year treasury yield has flashed some warning signs to a variety of parties. So, Jamie, we have the tax cut, we\u2019ve been waiting for the extra boost to the economy, whether it\u2019s capital expenditures or whatever. Do you think the economy is accelerating, it\u2019s still on steady footing, it\u2019s the same or maybe it\u2019s slowing down? And how should we think about the 10-year? And how do you think about the 10-year, and how do you manage to a flatter yield curve? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, just real quickly, Mari said, it\u2019s almost 9 or 10 years of growth at 2%, averaging 20% over the 10 years, it really should have been closer to 40%. There is a lot of evidence that the slack in the system is being finally -- people going back to workforce. The consumer balance sheet is in good space, capital expenditure is going up, household formation is going up, home building is in short supply, the banking system is very, very healthy compared to the past. Consumer confidence and business confidence are very high, albeit off their highs, probably because of some of our trade. So, if you\u2019re looking for potholes out there, there are not a lot of things out there, and growth is accelerating. And of course, things are always a little bit different. My own personal view is that the 10-year is 10-year. I wouldn\u2019t say it has to happen the way it\u2019s happened every time last time. I just think that\u2019s a mistake. The fed is reversing the balance sheet. I think it\u2019s very easy that rates can go up, the 10-year rates can go up in a healthy environment. In history, we\u2019ve had rates going up where you had a healthy environment. It\u2019s not always true that the 10-year going up is bad. Marianne Lake : Right. I would also say that the shape of the curve is correlated to fed funds in a tightening cycle and that is what we\u2019re seeing. So, while there are other factors weighing potentially on the 10-year in terms of still very accommodative central bank policy, particularly in the banks of Japan and the ECB where obviously trade is not necessarily constructive just in terms of the narrative, short-term underfunded pensions going into bumps, there are some technicals. But fundamentally, what you are seeing in terms of the flattening is pretty typical of a tightening cycle. And as long as it\u2019s accompanied with solid to strong economic growth, it doesn\u2019t concern us at this point. And in fact, as we\u2019ve been pointing out, we are still levered toward fund and rates from a profitability perspective, and we do expect the curve to steepen over time. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just one follow-up on the competition conversation. I just want to see, your loan growth decelerated but it was in line with your 7% to 8% goal. Your loan beta capture, what you\u2019re getting on the pricing side is actually a little bit better than what you\u2019ve given up on the deposit sign. So, that all seems fine, but this is the first time I remember putting in the comment about the competition. Are you still okay with the 7% to 8% goal? And maybe just an add-on to that, I\u2019m just curious if part of the competition has anything to do with the private credit market that seems to be growing pretty strongly. Marianne Lake : I would say just a tiny little correction. Our outlook was 6% to 7% core loan growth excluding the CIB. We\u2019re at 7% now. Things are still moving ahead in line with that. I would also just point out that it is an outlook, not a target. So, while we still feel like that is our outlook at this point, we obviously are going to make the right decisions, based upon the environment that we\u2019re in. Competitively the private credit market for commercial real estate, for leverage, lending, it\u2019s competitive, but so are also the mainstream competitors. It\u2019s just the environment is pretty constructive and everybody is trying to get access to the high-quality assets. So, margins are under pressure. And we will make sure we\u2019re getting the right return for the risk we\u2019re taking. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then, the follow-up on the expense side. If you did 16 times 4 would be 64. Your outlook is 62, but a lot of those were good expenses on better volumes. Are you still on track in your mind for the overhead ratio goals? I don\u2019t want to overly focus on a dollar amount. Marianne Lake : It\u2019s a couple of things. So, 62, remember, the 62 was before the impact of expense gross up. So, the actual full-year outlook was about $63 billion, about $63 billion including them. This quarter included one-time item, $174 million on the legal entity liquidation. We knew about that, obviously. So, it was in our number, but you can\u2019t annualize it, you can\u2019t sort of times it by four. So, you\u2019re absolutely right. As we look out for the full year, to the degree that we would be above our -- our outlook is $63 billion, it would be largely driven, if not exclusively driven, by higher performance-related compensation on higher revenues, with the only other caveat that as you probably know, we are waiting as I\u2019m sure you are for when the FDIC surcharge is taken away. The FDIC anticipated that would be in the middle of the year this year, but that is now potentially at some risk, moving out into the third or fourth quarter. So, while that could have an impact on this year, to answer your broader question, are we still on track for our expense overhead ratios? Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : So, just following on the theme of economics and policy, to what extent do you see trade friction, geopolitical concerns, those things starting to impact client sentiment, whether it\u2019s institutional or corporate clients? And ultimately, do you see that -- or how do you gauge that as being a risk to global growth and U.S. growth? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say, so far, where we are is that trade is firmly part of the risk narrative. So, it\u2019s definitely, as Jamie has said, on the psyche of people. But it\u2019s not at this point causing them to change the strategic actions and decisions that they\u2019re making, but clearly part of the conversation. And as currently outlined, it\u2019s more of that than it is a real impact to sort of the global macroeconomic outlook. But that isn\u2019t to say that uncertainty can\u2019t ultimately lead to more challenges or slower growth but because confidence is a really important part of not just business investment cycle but also the financial market stability. So, at this point, it\u2019s more of a risk narrative than it is an actual driver. But, it is important that that uncertainty is taken off the table. Saul Martinez : Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you addressed it earlier, a lot of multitasking this morning, but on the market side, you did much better than what Daniel suggested in his update in terms of year-on-year being flattish overall. Can you just give us a sense of what changed in the last month of the quarter? Marianne Lake : Yes. I\u2019m going to say yes. In a nutshell, it got better. But let me just give you the context. The context is as you\u2019ll recall, as we ended the first quarter, there were some bouts of volatility and clients became more cautious. And that carried over into the first part of this quarter. And so, while activity was fine, it wasn\u2019t as strong. In the second half of the quarter, that generally faded, activity levels picked up. And I would say there were more catalysts. And ironically, one of the more catalysts when you\u2019re thinking about trading volatility or intraday volatility or vol of vol, trade is part of that; emerging market idiosyncratic events are part of that. The European sovereign Italy situation, so, there\u2019s just more catalysts in the market and just generally, more client participation. Operator : Our next question is\u2026 Marianne Lake : Sorry. Just to finish that to make sure that no one is confused. It was pretty broad based. It was pretty consistent throughout the second half of the quarter. And it wasn\u2019t a lot of one-off large trades. Operator : And our next question comes is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Jamie, I wanted to ask about the China investment. I know that you put in the press release that you announced this quarter plans for a more significant investment in China. I just wanted to understand the timing. Is this something that\u2019s over the next year or this is a longer-term three to five-year? And if you could give us a sense as to how much is in your control versus needing regulatory approval from folks over there et cetera? Jamie Dimon : Right. So, I\u2019ll just make a broader business comment for a second. We don\u2019t run -- because I think we easily answered Mike Mayo\u2019s question. We don\u2019t run the business guessing about when there might be a recession because we know there\u2019s going to be one. We already priced through recession. We like to blame clients, bankers, cards, accounts, products, services. That\u2019s how we run the business. Some of the decisions you make are portfolio decisions. You can add to your mortgage portfolio or you can sell it. You can reduce your growth or the loans if you think the credit is bad. And of course, we will do that when the time comes, but we\u2019ll still be adding accounts. And so, to me, I don\u2019t worry as much about the 10-year bond or all these various things. We can manage those risks. We want more clients in almost every business we\u2019re in and want to do a very good job for them in products or services. China, it\u2019s a long-term story. We\u2019re not looking for any immediate thing. In the next 12 years or so, China will -- internal markets, maybe their bond markets, stock market is probably very close -- equal the size of the United States of America. Therefore, we want to be able to do everything we do here in China. We can do a lot of that in Hong Kong today, but we can\u2019t do it in Shanghai. So, we\u2019ve applied for licenses. And obviously, we need permission ultimately from our regulators and from their regulators. So, it\u2019s totally in their control. And it may or may not be affected by trade, but I look at this as a point in time. It is what it is. Eventually, we\u2019ll get these licenses. Eventually, hopefully, we\u2019ll be a large competitor in Shanghai. Remember, we already do a lot of that business with Chinese companies around the world, with Chinese companies in Hong Kong. I mean, there are a lot of people going into China. So, we\u2019re looking for the full set of licenses to do what we need to do for Chinese companies. Ultimately, I think it\u2019ll be good for China to have a company like JP Morgan equity, debt, credit, transparency, governance issues, inside China. Betsy Graseck : But right now, today, the ability to operate in Shanghai? Jamie Dimon : No. Look, we already do deposits, we do certain banking. What we can\u2019t do is equity, debt, and trading of equity and debt. Okay? So, if we get this license one day at 51%, we\u2019ll be able to make -- and with these licenses, we\u2019ll be able to basic equity underwriting, equity sales and trading, research, debt underwriting, debt sales and trading. We could do all of that today in Hong Kong. But remember, Chinese companies, they can do it in Shanghai, or they can do it in Hong Kong, or they can do it in London, or they can do it in New York. We just want the full capability. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Marianne, can you share with us, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet. Can you give us an update of where that stands today? Marianne Lake : So, the fed has been on a pretty well-telegraphed path here, reducing their balance sheet by about $50 billion a quarter. We talked about the fact that if you take $1.5 trillion out of the system, if you look at -- as the fed has grown its balance sheet, about half of that will ultimately impact deposits. And our share of it would be 10%. So, we talked about potentially that kind of $50 billion to $75 billion of deposit outflows over the several years it would take to reduce that. But primarily they would be -- not exclusively, but primarily not operating and therefore, limited impact on liquidity basis. And so, it\u2019s playing out textbook right now. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then, as a follow-up, I know you\u2019ve touched on this increased competition. Can you give us maybe some more details in the commercial real estate and the residential mortgage area, what you\u2019re actually seeing? Is it just pricing, or is it now loan covenants, is it loan-to-values, any further color there? Marianne Lake : So, residential mortgage correspondence in particular is pricing; pricing, pricing, pricing. And so, we will see share if pricing goes to what we consider to be not sufficient to return shareholder value. In the commercial real estate space, I would say, it is primarily pricing. So, spreads are under a lot of pressure. And the competition, as I said, it\u2019s GSEs, it\u2019s insurance companies, it\u2019s non-bank commercial institutions. It\u2019s a little bit less credit terms but still pretty robust, albeit that we are seeing a tiny shift to the right in LTVs. We\u2019re not going there, by the way, but I would call it pretty modest. So, I\u2019d say generally terms are holding up quite well. Jamie Dimon : On the competition issue. I think, it\u2019s good for the country, United States that we have a fully competitive field in card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and trading. There are strong competitors everywhere. It\u2019s just recognizing that. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s called capitalism. Operator : Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC. Al Alevizakos : Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve got one question and a follow-up. I do care about geographical speed of the IB performance. You mentioned that there were certain catalysts, and you also mentioned, both the Italian situation but also the niche market. So, I want to know whether the strength was driven by the U.S. or whether there were some specific kind of areas that were weaker or stronger. And then, my follow-up is that do you feel it is picking up\u2026 [technical difficulty] Marianne Lake : I am sorry. Jamie Dimon : It would be really helpful if you guys weren\u2019t on your cellphones. Marianne Lake : I am really, really sorry. But actually you were breaking up. And so, I didn\u2019t catch most of that question. Jamie Dimon : Where is the IB doing well internationally, USA or Italy? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, I would say across regions. Equities, strong performance across regions. While there were more catalysts this quarter, but you mentioned Italy, I think. None of those were particular drivers. So, we did fine on all of those, as well as I mentioned. So, I would say broad-based, gaining share we think in some areas in equity, cash and prime in particular, and holding our own elsewhere. And I would say solid performance across the FICC spectrum. And investment, yes, gaining share in investment banking. But obviously, you can\u2019t look at any one quarter. Al Alevizakos : Thanks for that. And the second part -- and sorry about that. You couldn\u2019t listen before. Do you feel that you\u2019ve started picking market share from the European competitors in the U.S., especially the ones that they are deleveraging? Marianne Lake : I mean, I would say that if you just go back over the course of the last couple of years, you have seen some share shift from European banks to U.S. banks broadly. In the prime space, I would say U.S. prime incumbents are gaining some share, but it\u2019s not a particularly new trend and it\u2019s not the dominant trend. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: To follow up on the net interest margin, you mentioned ex the markets business it was still increasing. And I was wondering if you could size the magnitude of the NIM increase linked quarter on a core basis, ex markets. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, linked quarter, reported down 2 basis points because of lower markets NII and higher market assets, $20 billion; core up 8 basis points. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just separately within CIB, the net charge-offs went up. Is that just some of the cleanup in energy? I know, you mentioned that there was a reserve release related to energy, but you had a little blip in the charge-offs there and I just wanted to get some color on that. Marianne Lake : So, in CIB, the charge-offs were driven by two names and the principal one was the remaining piece of the Steinhoff loan we sold this quarter. We had a reserve release against it that was larger. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Just a follow-up, Marianne. On the capital return that you guys were approved for in terms of the share repurchase. Is that going to be spread out evenly over the next four quarters or will it be more frontend loaded? Marianne Lake : So, we haven\u2019t disclosed that. But, if you look at our historical pattern, it\u2019s pretty even. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just a question on CECL. I think, Jamie mentioned in the past that CECL is not a big deal for you guys, and maybe you could explain why and what kind of prep work and what you are thinking about as you work to adopt that over the next couple of years? Marianne Lake : Sure. I mean, look, CECL is not a big deal insofar as we are getting ready for it. I will tell you that we haven\u2019t disclosed an adjustment number on the basis that we\u2019re still working through the modeling and the data. And it is more complicated, perhaps operationally to get everything lined up than you might think. We\u2019re going to intend to be running some stuff in parallel next year. So, we\u2019ll be able to give you much more color next year. Generally speaking, as we move to life of loan losses, it won\u2019t shock you to know that we will have an adjustment to our reserves through equity. It will be driven most likely by any of the portfolios that have longer weighted average life versus incurred loss models, and card would be the most notable, to a lesser extent unfunded wholesale commitments. But, it\u2019ll be manageable in the context of the firm, it goes through equity. And then, if you think about the economics the cash flows, the NPV of these loans doesn\u2019t change\u2026 Jamie Dimon : So, this is what my comment relates to. Marianne Lake : Yes. It doesn\u2019t change the economics of the loans. You upfront a little bit of reserves you get paid for over time. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fundamentally shift the dynamics. But that will play out. Jamie Dimon : You don\u2019t make economic decisions based upon accounting. Betsy Graseck : Are there any asset classes where it\u2019s shorter under CECL than under the incurred loss model? Marianne Lake : It\u2019s hard because it\u2019s life of loan. So, it\u2019s hard to have a shorter -- it\u2019s difficult to imagine that a life of loan could be shorter than an incurred loss. So, no, not really. But for us, the reason why it\u2019s pretty limited -- not to say there\u2019s no other impact, but the reason why it\u2019ll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life of loan at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : A quick question, follow-up on card retention. You mentioned that rewards redemption is a sign of engagement. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us, once redemption hits a certain level in terms of the number of points, so, the number of points remaining may not be enough to redeem a trip or whatever. What is the retention level then? Marianne Lake : I am not sure that I totally follow the question\u2026 Jamie Dimon : They\u2019re already -- they\u2019re constantly creating rewards points and they\u2019re constantly using those points. And when they use rewards points, some points cost us more than other points. And the pace of the use will change economics a little bit. But basically, it\u2019s still kind of what we expect over time. Marianne Lake : And remember that in a very, very oversimplified model of the universe, we would run an extraordinarily high level of redemption. We are giving these rewards to customers because we think that they are -- and they indeed are, perceiving great value in them. And so, we\u2019re just continuing to observe that as the mix changes. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thank you very much you guys. Bye, bye. Jamie Dimon : Thanks for joining. We will talk real soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.4 billion and EPS of $2.34 on revenue of $27.8 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 17%. The result this quarter was strong. Record net income for third quarter even excluding the impact of tax reform with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios. Highlights include, average core loan growth excluding the CIB up 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes and consumer were all up double digits. We gained share in global IB fees and across all regions year-to-date and in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and clients assets were both up 7%. Turning to page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Revenue of $27.8 billion was up $1.4 billion or 5% year-on-year. Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rate, net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by market NII and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments. Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year-on-year. More than half of the increase relates to investments we\u2019re making in technology, marketing, bankers broadly defined and real estate. And the remainder is driven by revenue related costs, principally higher auto lease depreciation and transaction expenses on higher volumes. Credit trends remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale. For the quarter, credit costs of $950 million were down $500 million year-on-year, driven by changes in consumer reserves. Briefly on page 3, turning to balance sheet and capital. So, little to say here other than as you can see, capital and risk weighted assets remained basically flat quarter-on-quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12%. Moving on to page four and Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated $4.1 billion of net income and an ROE of 31%. Core loans were up 6% year-on-year, driven by home lending up 10%, business banking up 5%, card up 4% and auto loans and leases up 3%. Deposits grew 4% year-on-year, continuing to outpace the industry although slower than a year ago. According to the recently released FDIC annual survey, we grew at nearly 2 times the average and we were the fastest growing bank in 9 of our top 10 markets. Chase also earned the number one spot in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth. Card sales volume was up 12% with strength across our portfolio, and we also saw very strong debit sales performance, up 13%. Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%. Consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth. Home lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and the smaller markets pressuring production margins. In addition, net servicing revenue was down including the MSR. Card, merchant services, and auto revenue was up 10%, driven by higher card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net card fees on lower acquisition costs predominately offset by lower net interchange and also on higher auto lease volumes. Expense of $7 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in technology and by auto lease depreciation. The overhead ratio was 53%. Finally on credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, we built reserves in card of $150 million, largely driven by growth. And we released reserve in the home lending purchased credit-impaired portfolio of $250 million, reflecting improvements in home prices and delinquencies. On charge-offs, there are few moving pieces. Year-on-year charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in home lending this quarter of about $80 million, together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in auto this period last year. Excluding those, charge-offs were about flat. But, we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for card. And in card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected and credit performance remained very strong. At this point, we expect card charge-off rates for the year to be below our guidance at about 310 basis points. Now turning to page five and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.6 billion, and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $8.8 billion up 3%. In banking, we maintained our number one ranking year-to-date in global IB fees as well as in North America and EMEA, and gained share across regions. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was flat to a strong prior year and we outperformed in a market of sound meaningful as we saw robust activity, particularly in ECM. Equity underwriting fees were up 40%, gaining share across all products with continued strength in IPOs, particularly in technology and healthcare. Advisory fees were down 6% compared to a third quarter record last year, outperforming the market and gaining share year-to-date. And debt underwriting fees were down 11% although better than the market, as our strong lead left positions drove share gains. Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong, up solidly from the prior year across products. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $4.4 billion, down 2% or up 1% when adjusting for the impact of tax reform, so another good performance. Fixed income markets revenue was down 6% adjusted with no single predominant driver. We saw mild weakness in rates, financing, credit rating and securitized products as a result of compressed margins and tighter financing spreads in range-bound and competitive markets. This was partly offset by higher activity levels in emerging markets on volatility and commodities returning to more normal levels relative to a weaker prior year. Equities continued the momentum from previous quarters and was up across all segments on the back of strong client activity. Equity revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued share gains in cash and prime and strong performance in corporate derivatives. Treasury services and securities services revenue were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, up 12% and 5% year-on-year respectively, driven by higher rates and balances. And securities services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity. Quarter-on-quarter, securities services revenue was down principally on seasonality and the impacts of the business exit. Finally, expense of $5.2 billion was up 8%, driven by higher legal expense, higher compensation expense as we invest in technology and bankers, and volume related transaction costs. Moving to commercial banking on page six. Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $581 million was flat, although we saw a strong underlying flow of business and pipelines remained robust and active. On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year-on-year and bases are trending higher, as we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher yielding investments. Expense of $853 million was up 7%, as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and technology initiatives. Loan balances were up 4% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. In C&I, demand remains muted in the wake of tax reform as well client confidence is high, balance sheet is strong and liquid, and the environment is competitive. For us, C&I loans were up 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially, in line with the industry. But if you decompose it, we\u2019re growing strongly in our expansion markets and specialized industries, growing solidly in our core markets, but are seeing notable offset in tax expense activity, given the mix of our business. CRE loans were up 3% year-on-year, a little less than the industry as we\u2019re seeing increased competition and continue to be very selective. Finally, credit performance remained strong with net recovery of 3 basis points. Moving on to asset and wealth management on page seven. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $724 million with a pretax margin of 27% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees, net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products. These are partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains, including on seed capital investments. Additionally, banking is also strong. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in advisors and technology, as well as high external fees on revenue growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion with positive flows across all asset classes. In addition, we saw net liquidity inflows of $14 billion. AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both up 7% with more than half of the increase being driven by flows and the remainder on higher market. Deposits were down 8% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments with us, and down 5% sequentially including seasonality. Finally, we had loan balances up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to page eight and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $145 million. Treasury and CIO net income was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other corporate was a net loss of $241 million, including markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments of $220 million pretax. For the whole Company, legal costs were a modest negative, with the benefit here in other corporate being more than offset in the CIB. Moving to page 9 and outlook. We recently gave you updated outlook, so unsurprisingly that still holds and it\u2019s here on the page. Only two things of note. Our expense outlook assumes that the FDIC surcharge ended this quarter. So, clearly an extension would pose a risk. And on tax, there are a number of questions in the rules, which we expect to be clarified by the end of the year. We will have to work through them but would not expect any changes to be material. So to close. We are growing across most of our businesses. We\u2019re investing heavily in all of them. We\u2019re investing in technology, bankers and beyond. Credit is in great shape and the earnings power of the Company is evident. We are particularly proud of the strength and improvement in customer satisfaction broadly and our continued investments which drive leadership positions and market share gains. This quarter, we announced Sapphire Banking and our digital investing platform You Invest. We opened our first branch as part of our expansion strategy in Washington DC, announced additional expansion into Philadelphia and Boston, and also announced our AdvancingCities initiative as we invest for growth in the clients and communities that we serve. With that, operator, please open the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, at the Investor Day, I remember asking you the same question. So, I apologize. But, you have talked about consumer and corporate balance sheets being in great shape and having low debt service burden. The 10-year is up a modest 35 basis points since then and the world is freaking out that it\u2019s the end of the cycle and that\u2019s going to choke off the recovery. Your results are your results but they\u2019re some will say backward looking. Are you seeing any impact, A, at the modest increase in the curve now? And B, I\u2019ll ask again, is there a level of rates where you would start to see an impact of slowdown in what you\u2019re willing to lend rising in credit costs, things like that? Thank you. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say -- I would sort of pick up on the tone that you had in your question, which is the level of rates is not surprisingly high. And so, from our vantage point we\u2019re not seeing anything in terms of looking at our current dialogue or for that matter at credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic. With higher rates and we do this all the time, we obviously look at all of our portfolio and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points even up 200, although clearly where we are now, risks are more asymmetric but -- I mean more symmetric. But, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any extraordinary stress that becomes evident, even if you -- obviously, the margin you\u2019re going to get more but it doesn\u2019t seem to be overwhelming. And it speaks, I think to the fact that low rates have been around for long term -- time. People have had the chance to get prepared. There is a lot of liquidity. And in the corporate space in particular, people have been able to hedge. So, is there an absolute level of rates where things will be problematic? At some point, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near there. So, I\u2019m not saying that there couldn\u2019t be select downgrades; I\u2019m not saying that at the margin, there may not be some incremental stress if rates continue to go much higher, but that\u2019s not where we are right now. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks very much, Marianne. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : So, I wanted to start with the question on the You Invest launch. As we think about the strategy for the business, I want to understand, is the goal to compete with the incumbents to win new clients or are you simply trying to augment the existing offerings for JPMorgan clients? And it\u2019s really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy, given that the pricing is quite competitive but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far? Marianne Lake : Yes. I mean, remember, You Invest, it\u2019s early. Jamie just said, I don\u2019t know if you heard it. Yes and yes. Clearly, we are trying to add products and capabilities and value to our existing clients in an effort to continue to drive loyalty and engagement, and also earn more share of their wallet. But, we do think that the proposition is compelling and that the pricing is disruptive. And we should also expect over time to be able to attract new accounts. So, yes and yes, but it\u2019s early days. We\u2019re going to continue to develop, You Invest, its capabilities to iterate it and improve it. So far, it\u2019s early but good. Steve Chubak : And just one follow-up for me relating to the commentary on the deposit side. You spoke of some of the headwinds to the deposit growth and these are more industry trends, including yield-seeking behavior on both the commercial and asset management side. I know you\u2019ve given some helpful guidance in terms of the impact of Fed QE unwind as well, in the past. I\u2019m just wondering, is the yield seeking-behavior you\u2019ve seen so far consistent with your expectation, do you still expect to grow deposits as we look out for the next couple of years? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, the answer is generically yes, as we would have expected. Obviously, we have no crystal ball as to the sort of timing and parts of these things. But, it is paying out arguably little slower than we thought, but like we thought. And I would say that our outlook for deposit growth is -- for it to be slower, but still positive. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So, first question just on the rate question that you got earlier. But, I wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the impact on the outlook for your asset yields, in particular the securities portfolio. I know you\u2019ve given guidance on that before, but given the sharp backup that we\u2019ve got over the last couple of weeks, how is that impacting your forward look on that? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I mean, on the asset side of the balance sheet just a big rule of thumb is that a little less than half of our loans are variable, index sort of prime and LIBOR. And so, what we\u2019ve been seeing -- in any one quarter, there can be noise on one time item mix or whatever else. But, largely speaking, for every rate hike we\u2019ve been seeing on the front end, we\u2019re seeing our assets reprice about half of that and that -- or loans be priced about half of that and that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect. Similarly, if we see sustained increases in the low end of the curve, then we would see that play through into our investment securities yield. Obviously, this quarter while there was a meaningful increase on a spot basis, on average basis that wasn\u2019t the case and particularly not for mortgages. So, it had a modest impact on investment security yields this quarter. But, again, if it was a sustained and more sizeable, we would see that play through yes -- or would rotate the assets into higher book yields over time. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, my follow-up question has to do with a blockchain that you launched this quarter. I think, it was on September 25th, you launched a blockchain for international payments. And I know at Investor Day, you talked a lot about the investments you were making on that side. Should we be viewing this as a competitor to SWIFT? Is that how the vision is for this blockchain? Marianne Lake : So, this is the Interbank Information Network which we talked at Investor Day. And now, we have I think 75 banks and growing signed up to it. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look at it exactly like that. I would say, this use case at least for now is very much around reducing the friction in the wholesale payment space in terms of inquiry and information sharing and not at this point about processing payments. So, we are still exploring use cases across the board on blockchain. I\u2019m very excited about this and the uptake; it will be I think meaningful. But, I wouldn\u2019t think of it that way, not yet. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My first question expands on what the Glenn had asked. So, clearly, the bank stocks have been hit along with the broad market. And I guess, you\u2019re telling us one of two things. One, either the economy is slowing down or the relationship between bank revenue growth and solid economic growth in the U.S. is broken or not somehow is correlated as expected. And I\u2019m wondering, given your fairly strong results across the board, where is the market wrong in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy? Marianne Lake : Yes. I would just start by saying, I think there is a lot of sort of macro uncertainty, noise and overhang that have been affecting the market over the last few days. So, overthinking any one driver or sort of confusion I think might be challenging. I would say that as we look at the economy, we don\u2019t see it slowing down. It seems to be continuing to grow pretty solidly. There is divergence around the world. So, it\u2019s led by U.S. strength, but still expecting there to be more convergence going forward. So, I actually think that our outlook is still quite optimistic on the global economy, and not to say to James\u2019 point that there are some risks out there. And so, as we -- and also, just to talk about monetary policy for a second. Everything, given that growth outlook, is really sort of lining up for December rate hike and sort of more hikes into 2019 and the continuation hopefully of a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks. It is definitely the case that as we\u2019ve been talking about the years now, as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet and liquidity is coming out of the system, yes, we are seeing deposit growth slow. And there is a natural feedback loop, as you reprice liabilities, you\u2019ll have a natural asset base response. And so you might have slower growth on the asset side relative to the past, but it should be at higher spreads, and that should be how it plays out. So, there is really no change, I don\u2019t think in our expectation of the drivers. Erika Najarian : That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, and I picked up in part of your response to an earlier question Marianne. As we think about your wholesale loan trends year-over-year which continues to outpace the banking industry. Could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle market lending? And I guess, we\u2019re really wondering what you\u2019re observing in terms of competition more in structure rather than rates? And whether or not some of the liquidity that you noted could be drained out of the system, would change the competitive dynamics near term? And sort of what is JPMorgan\u2019s indirect exposure that remains on balance sheet on the sponsor-backed transactions. Sorry, I know that is a lot. Marianne Lake : Yes. I\u2019ll try to remember all of that. First of all, I would just clarify that when you say wholesale loan growth has been outpacing the industry, I would say that from my recollection, over the course of the last several quarters, we\u2019ve basically been saying in line with, if not maybe even slightly less than in line with the industry, but it is nuance, you need to get beneath it. There are areas where we would fully expect to be growing more strongly than the industry, and those are in our newer expansion markets where we\u2019ve been investing, we\u2019re reaping the benefits of those investments, and we\u2019re growing from a smaller base and deepening into the market. In our core markets, the mature markets, in line to maybe not even quite as we are being cautious given where we are in the cycle. So, I just want to clarify that\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We haven\u2019t changed our standards. Marianne Lake : We haven\u2019t materially changed our underwriting standards, no. And if anything, I would say, we\u2019re just being cautious of the margin. And with respect to competition outside of banks, it\u2019s definitely true that non-banks are gaining share. And it\u2019s also true that they are structure-wise going to be willing to do and are willing to do things that we are not. And so, for our best clients, we aren\u2019t largely going to lose on price, we would be willing to work on price. But we would walk away on structure. Jamie Dimon : And we don\u2019t have a lot of residual exposure to sponsors doing that kind of lending. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s right. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : So, Marianne, look, I mean ROTCE of 17%, you seem to have some deposit market share gained, but year-over-year for the third quarter, expenses are up more than revenues. So, can you highlight the dollar amount of investment spending and how that\u2019s changed and where you are in that progression? Marianne Lake : Yes. Just before we get into expense for a second, if you step back, just a couple of things. I wouldn\u2019t look at any one quarter when I\u2019m thinking about operating leverage, not to overplay seasonality or anything else. But, I would look at the whole year. And tax reform is an important part of that. So, if you look at year-to-date on a reported basis rather than a managed basis, year-over-year, year-to-date, we have about 200 basis points of positive leverage. So, tax reform is a big factor. And then, obviously, we had some private equity losses which are episodic in this quarter\u2019s revenue print. So, I think there is strong growth across the businesses. So, expense number and investments, our expenses are up over a $1 billion year-on-year, in line outside of FDIC and revenue related costs, in line with the guidance we gave at the Investor Day. So, think about that sort of $2.7 billion of year-over-year investments, and we\u2019re working through it. So, we\u2019re on track. It\u2019s different from revenues insofar as it\u2019s more linear. And so, expenses are in line and leverages -- positive leverages are I think pretty strong. Mike Mayo : And just one separate question for you, Jamie. Your CEO letter highlights the expectation that interest rates would go a lot higher, so I guess for a long -- the track that you laid out. But, it doesn\u2019t seem like the market is digesting it as maybe as well as you might have thought the market would digest. So, it\u2019s basically what you expected. So, what\u2019s different between your expectations and how the recent market\u2019s been reacting? Jamie Dimon : I think, I noted that the market may not take it that well if rates go up and -- because it\u2019ll surprise people a little, people shouldn\u2019t be surprise. And of course, so many things have changed as we\u2019ve been through this before, like monitory policy, liquidity ratios, capital ratios et cetera. So, I was also pointing out that -- just about probability that rates can go higher, people should be prepared for that; they should not be surprised about it. So, I\u2019m always surprised when people are surprised. And the why is more important? You\u2019re still growing. The economy is strong, rates are going up. Most of us consider it a healthy normalization, and going back to a more of a free market when it comes to asset pricing and interest rates et cetera, and we need that. So, to me, overall, it\u2019s a good thing, particularly because the economy is strong. And so, I do expect rates will continue to go up. We don\u2019t bet the company on that. That\u2019s just my own expectation. I have a -- I would put much higher odds in it being at 4% to most of the people, but again, the economy is strong. So, as long as it\u2019s normalized strong economy, it\u2019s a good thing. The economy could be strong for a while. I mean, Marianne pointed out wage is going up, participation is going up, credit has been written as pristine. Housing is in short supply. Confidence, both small business, consumer is extraordinarily high. And that could drive a lot of growth for a while, in spite of some of the headwinds out there. Marianne Lake : I also think -- I mean, not exactly, but if you went back and looked a couple of years ago, what the 2-year forward 10-year rate would look like, it would look much like this. And so, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been -- because the covers having a hard time pushing up that people are now focused on it, but this is what we would have expected, should expect and higher. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on deposits. We\u2019re starting to see some slowing of growth if not outflows in some areas as rates rise. How do you -- but you guys still have a loan to deposit ratio that\u2019s in sort of the mid-60s and you\u2019ve been gaining share on the retail side. What\u2019s your sense of I guess competition for deposit and pricing, particularly in the core retail bank? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, when we think about the -- well, it\u2019s not really about competition particularly. When we think about the deposit base and the retail consumer relationship, deposits and rate paid is a important part of it, but it\u2019s increasingly less important, not that it\u2019s not significant. And so, when you think about the value that we give to our customers, it\u2019s not just that but it\u2019s also all of the customer experience initiatives that we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s about convenience, about digital mobile capabilities, it\u2019s about launching new products, new services, simplifying the environment for them. So, there\u2019s a lot of different investments and things to play which might make this kind of normalization cycle look a little different. And so, the way we think about it is we look carefully across the spectrum of deposits, retail and wholesale at what we are seeing in terms of flows and balances and elasticity for our customers on our balance sheet. And that\u2019s how we think about our strategy for deposit reprice. And it\u2019s sort of largely behaving as we would have expected. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ll just make a macro point too. As the Fed reduces balance sheet -- just say by $1 trillion over the next 18 months or whatever, which they indicated they\u2019re going to do, that\u2019s $1 trillion out of deposits. That will have an effect kind of macro competition and stuff like that. And we try to estimate the big points, is it coming out of wholesale, kind of retail? It\u2019s hard to know. But that will change the competition a little bit for deposits. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. And maybe a follow-up on that investment spend. Do you -- I mean obviously, it went up with the Tax Cut helping to accelerate some investments. Do we think of it going forward stabilizing at these high levels, or is this sort of a one-off sort of increase and we might see that come down or do we keep increasing? How do we think about the investment spent needs going forward a little further out? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say, and first of all obviously, we\u2019ll give you more thoughts on forward-looking guidance at a future date. But just generically, I wouldn\u2019t really put tax reform as being a primary reason for what we\u2019re doing on investments. I would say that we have identified the opportunity to accelerate capabilities that are consistent with our client strategic long-term goals and so we\u2019ve been leaning into that this year. And so, it was a pretty sizable step up this year acknowledging that. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that continue. But, we\u2019re going to carry on investing in technology, adding bankers, opening branches, launching new products so that we\u2019re defending the long-term growth and profitability of the Company. And in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that we\u2019re still targeting -- not targeting, but we\u2019re still expecting an overhead ratio to be around about the mid-50s over the medium term, which on revenue growth, implies we\u2019ll continue to invest and there is also volume-related costs associated with that. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering on the regulatory front, do you any visibility into the future interaction of CCAR process with the new loan loss accounting rules, CECL, particularly in the context of the stress capital buffer potentially being implemented? Because it seems like we could have some overlapping procyclicality and then the potential to freeze that into the run rate capital. So, I was just kind of wondering, is there any visibility yet on that and is that a big area of uncertainty for you? Marianne Lake : So, you hit the nail on the head with both your question and what that could imply. It is a big area of uncertainty. We do not have clarity on capital broadly as it relates to CECL, including whether there will be permanent capital relief and/or how that will play into CCAR. It is one of the most open questions we have. So, right now, what we know is -- as far as I know, anyway that we don\u2019t have to put the CCAR impacted until -- sorry, CECL impact in until CCAR 2020. So, it\u2019s not sort of imminent question, but it\u2019s an important one, and we don\u2019t know the answer. Jamie Dimon : It seems to me that every single time there\u2019s a chance to make things more procyclical or less, we make it more procyclical. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s the data for sure. So, we would encourage the dialogue on clarifying capital treatments with large to be at the forefront of standard set of mind. Jamie Dimon : This also won\u2019t change our strategy. That\u2019s just accounting. John McDonald : Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I was wondering how rising rates are affecting competition and capacity in the mortgage business, and whether the regulations in mortgage have made you open to reconsidering getting back into some areas that you exited after the crisis. Marianne Lake : So, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are, on higher rates, expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year-on-year. We are down in line maybe or more than that, but for us, it\u2019s a tale of two channels. We are flat year-on-year in the consumer channel, so decent consumer engagement and purchase market share. And we\u2019re down meaningfully in correspondent because we are pricing for some risk and higher rates. With respect to would we be willing to reconsider our opposition on mortgage, the narrative, the dialogue is constructive, but there hasn\u2019t actually been any resolution to the bigger challenges. So, if we can get that resolution, then, I think the answer would be largely, yes. Jamie? Jamie Dimon : No. I would just add that mortgage -- the mortgage company is earning money, is doing quite well. Delinquencies are way down; we\u2019re competitive. We started Chase My Home. So, you can digitally track your mortgage process. And there\u2019s a lot of good stuff coming. And so, the big picture is pretty good. Obviously, refis and new home sales are probably down because of the rates a little bit. Marianne Lake : And you are right. There is excess capacity in the market right now and that will clear -- it will clear itself out over the course of coming months. And we\u2019re in this for relationships, not volumes. And margins are under pressure as a result, but they will stabilize. Jamie Dimon : And that is an area by the way where all the riskier lending has gone to non-banks pretty much. Operator : Your next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Al Alevizakos : I would like to ask a question on the CIB. Especially, I would like to focus more about the outlook that you gave that the spreads are getting tighter. And I would like to know regarding the credit and securitization business where we\u2019ve seen issuance being quite slow during the summer, then continuing like that in September. Do you see that there is a risk-off mode in the market? And how would you believe that the revenues would actually move going in Q4 and then in the New Year? Do you think that generally fixed-income wallet would actually be going down? Marianne Lake : A risk of what? Sorry. Al Alevizakos : The what? Sorry. Jamie Dimon : The risk of wallet will go down. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I\u2019d say, on the margin point, it\u2019s been the case that for particularly in the sort of more liquid space, you\u2019ve seen margins coming down consistently over the years. So, it\u2019s not necessarily that this is some sort of step change or new phenomenon, but it\u2019s competitive. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. On the SPG side, pipelines aren\u2019t strong at this point. So, we expect the fourth quarter to go much like the third. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ll just make a long-term point here too. In the next 20 years or so, the total fixed-income markets around the world are going to double. And that is just an important thing to keep back in mind. So, when you run the business, you run the business to capture your share of that doubling, and of course, margins over time will come down, and the way you do it is being transformed by electronics, et cetera, but it\u2019s a pretty good future outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Marianne, on the consumer credit side, I should say, you made the point about card losses remaining low and -- towards the low end of what you had thought for the year. But, I also noticed that you also added to the card reserve and noted higher losses. So, can you give us the to and fro about just what you\u2019re seeing in the underlying on card and losses and trajectories? Thanks. Marianne Lake : Sure. So, as you know, we\u2019ve been talking for a couple of years now about the fact that we did some targeted credit expansion in the card space a few years back. And naturally, as that seasons, it will -- risk-adjusted returns that are healthy, but underwriting loans with higher loss rates, which means that as that seasons that the overall portfolio loss rate will naturally increase, so, the higher the percentage of newer vintages are, the higher the loss rate will be, in accordance with our underwriting standards and at good risk-adjusted returns. So, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been tracking and guiding to, and expecting. The build this quarter was more about loan growth than it was about the seasoning of the charge-off rate, but it was a bit of both. My comment about the performance though is if we had looked at the 2018 card loss rate as we did at the beginning of the year, we said we would have expected it to be closer to 3.25%, but there are three things driving it to be slightly better. The first is the pre-expansion vintages are holding up very well. So, the pre-2015 vintages continue to hold up very well. The second is that as we have continued to observe the newer vintages, we\u2019ve been rigorous in terms of, at the margin, doing risk pullbacks and ensuring we\u2019re managing the performance really well. And the third is that we\u2019ve been improving our collection strategy. So, a combination of factors have allowed us to deliver, apples to apples, a charge-off rate for the portfolio that\u2019s a little better than we would have expected coming into the year. Ken Usdin : Yes. Great color. Thank you. Can I\u2026 Jamie Dimon : [Indiscernible] through the cycle number. So, you should explain that to them too. Marianne Lake : Yes. And obviously, in this portfolio, as we go through the cycle, we would expect charge-off rates to continue to rise. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I emphasized that the pre-expansion vintages continue to be that kind of -- you\u2019ll remember we hit that 2.5% charge-off rate, which is extraordinarily low for this kind of portfolio, and we\u2019re still there for those pre-expansion vintages. So, naturally, as the cycle matures, we will see that rise, but we aren\u2019t seeing it yet. Ken Usdin : Yes, makes sense. And can I ask you just on the other side, can you talk a little bit of auto in the same context too where the losses have been flat as a pancake? Can you talk about that, and also just that leasing side of the book, which we more see in the other income? Are you still seeing the same potential for growth in both the on-balance sheet and the leases? Marianne Lake : So, on the loan side in auto, I would say that we are losing share as we competition from credit unions and captives that may have economic frameworks that are different from ours. We are not going to chase volume. We\u2019re going to get the appropriate return for the risks. So, we are -- our credit reflects our discipline on pricing and underwriting standards. And so, it is continuing to be flat to a little better. On the leasing side, we do leasing with our manufacturing partners. We are seeing very strong growth. We\u2019re very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but it\u2019s very high quality growth. And that looks set to continue. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : I just wanted to follow up on the question on operating leverage. And how should we think about the outlook for positive operating leverage, just more philosophically? Your efficiency ratio is currently not materially above the 55% through the cycle expectation. So, should we be thinking of positive operating leverage as part of the investment narrative, or is the goal really to invest in favorable business outcomes, operating leverage does what it does and really doesn\u2019t drive business decisions? Marianne Lake : More the latter than the former. So, obviously, we have a view of what we think the right return profile for these businesses should look like. And we\u2019re investing to deliver those returns through the cycle and over the long term. So, we don\u2019t have an operating leverage target in mind when we set our investment strategy, nor do we for that matter have an expense target in mind either. So, again, we saw a reasonable step up year-on-year this year because we saw the opportunity to do that well. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see that kind of growth. But, again, operating leverage is more of an outcome, not entirely, but more of an outcome than an input. Jamie Dimon : And mix. Marianne Lake : Yes. And mix. Saul Martinez : And, if I could just ask a quick follow-up on CECL, I know you don\u2019t manage the accounting outcomes. And I think, Marianne, you mentioned that a number of areas last quarter where CECL could have an impact. But, any update just on CECL preparations and when you think you might have an estimate of what the effects could be? Marianne Lake : So, I appreciate that you guys have been asking about this now for a while. And I hate to tell you that the modeling, the data, the methodologies are complicated. So, operationally, we are working through that across all of our businesses. We continue to expect to be running in parallel through some parts of 2019 across some of our portfolios so that we can make sure that we fully understand the potential implications. We don\u2019t have a number for you. But, I will tell you this, same as I said last time. The biggest driver is likely to be card because of the size of the portfolio and the 12-month incurred loss model today. So, the weighted average life of the portfolio driven by revolvers would be longer than that most likely. There will be some other impacts, pluses and minuses. Research reports have been written. I think on average for those that have been written have suggested that not just for us, but across others that the reserve increase could be 20% to 30%. And while I don\u2019t have a number for you, it\u2019s not implausible. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I wanted to follow up on the discussion about increased competition in FICC. And I guess the language in the release kind of implied there was some increase in competition. Your comments on the call here say it\u2019s been competitive for some time. And I guess, I was trying to square those two. And I would just add that coming into this year, you had the Number one FICC share, and incredibly, you\u2019ve been the biggest FICC share gainer year to date when we look on a global basis. So, you\u2019ve been building on top of that share. And I\u2019m just trying to gauge if there\u2019s been a change among competition trying to get some of that share back and maybe if that\u2019s just started to accelerate. Marianne Lake : I think if you go back a number of years when we were all having those like deep and meaningful debates about whether we should be changing our FICC operating model. And we were committed to the full spectrum, complete platform. You roll forward to 2016, there was outperformance in fixed income. And coming in -- and people had made changes to their operating model and operations. And the competition came back pretty fiercely, I would say, into 2017. And then, in 2017, the market didn\u2019t play nicely, particularly the volatility and volumes were less robust than they\u2019ve been in 2016. But we haven\u2019t seen the competition let up. So, people are back and wanting to enjoy. Jamie just talked about it. The fixed income wallet will double and pretty much, everyone everywhere wants to enjoy some of that. And so, the competition -- it\u2019s a combination of -- it\u2019s been very competitive for a while and it continues to be so. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a step change, but it does obviously feel particularly when volatility has been reasonably contained outside of specific emerging market kind of areas that everybody is competing for these thin margins. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, just broadly speaking, if we look at both FICC and equity trading, obviously, you\u2019ve had the leadership position with FICC; you\u2019ve been gaining a lot of share in equity, including this year. What do you think the biggest driver of that is? It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the capital or liquidity advantage. Is it all the technology spend that you\u2019ve been doing? What are a couple reasons you\u2019d just chalk it up to high level? Marianne Lake : So, if you think about the -- we\u2019re sort of gaining share most notably in cash and prime. And if you go back a number of years ago, we were pretty open and honest about the fact that we weren\u2019t where we needed to be in either of those two scenarios, and we have been consistently investing in the platform, and it is technology. Think about prime with -- building out of the prime platform, particularly internationally has been a game changer. And we\u2019ve had a best-in-class competitive offering over the course of the last couple of years. And now we\u2019re getting the momentum of being able to deliver that to clients. And similarly, we\u2019ve been investing in the cash side. So, it\u2019s across the complex, but we\u2019re getting the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve been making. I also think that the relationship effects of having the equities business with our private bank and with the commercial bank, the feedback loop is also quite powerful. So, it has a little bit to do with our operating model, our platform as a company. Jamie Dimon : And really great research. Marianne Lake : Yes. Great research. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. I had a quick follow-up question on the securities services. You mentioned that there was a decline sequentially based on seasonality and the exit of the business, but is there any way to size that to get to what the underlying growth trends were in that segment? Marianne Lake : From an underlying growth trend perspective, I would look year-over-year rather than sequentially. I sort of point out the sequential points because of seasonality, we also exited U.S. broker/dealer business. So that obviously has an impact. It is also the case. So, if you think about the year-on-year growth of 5%, we have been growing more than that, led by very strong growth in NII. For this business, this is a wholesale business where deposit bases are high. So, we would expect that growth to level off, and in this quarter in particular, just the specifics of our internal transfer pricing is that LIBOR OAS narrowed and it just had an impact. Year-over-year, continue to expect us to grow assets, asset-based fees, NII solidly but not as strongly, and transactions. So, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be high single digit or mid single digit growth year-on-year. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. And then, just one separate question on the non-interest bearing deposits, I mean it came down in the quarter. Was that mostly just on the corporate side, or was there also some pickup in the deposit gammas on the retail side as well? Marianne Lake : Not on the retail side, not yet. There\u2019s not a sufficiently compelling rate differential to be driving into product migration on the retail side yet, but we are seeing it on the wholesale side. Operator : The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : I apologize if you\u2019ve already addressed this, but can you give us the outlook for the pipeline for commercial loan growth or commercial loans in investment banking? I know it\u2019s very early in the quarter. But with the trading volatility we\u2019ve seen, any color that you can share with us on that as well? Marianne Lake : Okay. So, commercial loans, we\u2019re 4% up year-on-year, flat to 1% up sequentially. At this point, as we look forward over the near term, it feels like that kind of steady growth GDP plus, GDP is what we\u2019re going to get. And remember, everybody has a different mix, but one of the things that happened quickly with tax reform is that the government healthcare hospital not-for-profit space was less compelling from a loan sense, and now are going to be more compelling in the capital markets. So, we\u2019re seeing that impact our growth down. So, I would say that not quite mid-single digit growth feels like a decent outlook, all other things being equal. In terms of the capital markets, well, I would say that the third-quarter pipelines coming out into fourth quarter and momentum sets us up for a decent fourth quarter honestly, across products. Clearly, volatility depending upon how long it stays around and what the drivers are, can impact business confidence. We\u2019re not necessarily expecting that. So, I would still say the outlook across products is good with ECM obviously being the one that would most likely impacted. But even there, I think it might be more of a sort of temporary set of pauses as people see how everything is digested. And honestly, on market, no good ever comes of trying to predict what a course will look like after a couple weeks. And volatility is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be constructive in some ways and less in others. So, there\u2019s no good coming of a prediction at this point. I will say one thing about markets, just to give you guys a tiny view, which I know you now, but just because of tax reform and another one-off item in the fourth quarter, flat year-on-year comparably would be up. Gerard Cassidy : Very good; I appreciate that. The second question is, when we look at the weekly H.8 data on Fridays, the smaller banks in this country are growing their loan books much faster than the larger banks. You obviously had good loan growth this quarter, but it doesn\u2019t match up to what the smaller banks are producing. So, the question is what impact do you think the CCAR process has had on you when you compare your underwriting prefinancial crisis? I know you\u2019re not changing your underwriting standards, but do you think the larger banks are more conservative as a general statement? And it\u2019s reflected in these very strong credit quality numbers you and your peers are posting today. Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s difficult to generalize. And obviously, everybody has sort of a different risk appetite. It might be fine if you\u2019re getting properly paid to grow more quickly. We are sticking with our guns in terms of our underwriting and risk appetite on credit. The other thing I think you have to bear in mind and again, it depends on the particular situation of any competitor is that we are materially and increasingly bound by standardized risk-weighted assets. And so, while we don\u2019t overthink that and we do honestly think about economic capital, at some level, we have to generate a positive return for shareholders and shareholder value. And it\u2019s on these very high credit quality loans that we\u2019re producing, it\u2019s expensive. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I wanted to take a little bit different slant on deposit betas, just ask a three-part question. One, is the increase in deposit betas that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of Fed moves, surprising at all or abnormal in your opinion to normal historical trends? Marianne Lake : So, I would say, if you look at the first four hikes, it was relatively muted deposit reprice across the complex. It accelerated for the last three hikes, I\u2019m excluding September, given obviously, when it happened. So, we are seeing an acceleration in betas. And it started at the top end of wholesale and it will migrate through the complex over time. I would say, it\u2019s in line to arguably better than we would have modeled, but remember that this cycle did start in a very different place. So, in a while if we looked at history, we might have seen reprice in totality having been higher at this point, we started at 100 basis points of rates, not 25. So, I think that plays into it too. So, generally in line with expectations is what I would say. Marty Mosby : Okay. That\u2019s what I would say. So, let\u2019s go to the next question. Given that rates have been low for so long going up until we started increasing rates, we\u2019ve repriced almost every security and loan we had on the books. So, the actual upward potential to reprice portfolio yields to current market rates has got to be larger than what we typically have seen historically. Do you agree or disagree with that idea? Marianne Lake : I would say, yes. Obviously, it depends on how you position the company over that period. But we talked about it before we were and have consistently been relatively short the market. We\u2019ve been keeping dry powder so we could invest as long as rates go up. And we still are looking at that. But obviously, there\u2019s convexity in the portfolio too, so, paying attention to that. Yes, I agree. Marty Mosby : Yes. So, the stretch between this portfolio yield, so, asset yields can actually reprice faster than what we\u2019ve seen historically. So, the combination of those two things in our estimation gives us a threshold. So, if we saw backwards for deposit betas, it gives us a threshold if we estimate for JPMorgan of somewhere between 80% to 90% deposit betas before you actually break through and start eroding net interest margin. Currently, you had about a 40% deposit beta this quarter. So, you had a lot of headroom still to go before margins start to really erode, given deposit pricing. So, I just wanted to get a feel for that estimate of 80% to 90%, given where you\u2019re at today. Marianne Lake : Okay. So, obviously, I don\u2019t know exactly your mental model, but let me tell you this. I think you\u2019re right -- I don\u2019t know about the 80%, 90% specifically, but you\u2019re right about net interest margin if you look through any short-term noise. So, we would expect the trend for our firmwide and core NIM to be \u2013 to trend or grind higher over time. But, it does depend on the path and pace of reprice. So, if we continue to see deposit betas stay low or lower than potentially, a linear kind of move, you\u2019ll see margins increase, and then, as they accelerate back to target, you might even see it compress. But, if you see through that over the long run, yes, net interest margins will be higher. And that will be driven mainly by balance sheet growth, mix, and long end of rates. At Investor Day, you might remember, we told you that beyond 2018, net-net, there was little rate left to go, and it was going to be more about balance sheet, mix and growth, and long end of rates a little compounding. But, the path does matter. So, you can see core NIM in particular will be very vulnerable to the pace of reprice. Why would you look through that? Sorry. Operator? Operator : There are no additional questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thank you, everyone. Jamie Dimon : Thank you.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, increasing core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses. For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income was $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform. And so, we\u2019re entering 2019 with good momentum across all businesses. Turning to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $26.8 billion was up $1.1 billion or 4% year-on-year, driven by net interest income. NII was up $1.2 billion or 9% on higher rates and on loan and deposit growth. Non-interest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB.  Expense of $15.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year. The increase is related to investments we\u2019re making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office, as well as revenue-related costs including growth in Auto. This was partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fees. As we had hoped, the incremental surcharge was eliminated effective the end of the third quarter and this is a benefit of a little over $200 million for the quarter across our businesses. Credit trends remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $240 million year-on-year, driven by changes in reserves. In Consumer, we built reserves of $150 million in Cards on loan growth.  In Wholesale, over the last several quarters, we have seen net reserve releases and recoveries. However, this quarter, we had about $200 million of credit costs. Again largely reserve builds on select C&I client downgrades driven by a handful of names across multiple sectors.  While we are constantly looking at the granular level, these downgrades are idiosyncratic and do not reflect signs of deterioration in our portfolio. The outlook for credit as we see it remains positive.  Shifting for the full year results on Page 3, we have posted net income for the year of $32.5 billion, a return on tangible common equity of 17% and EPS of $9 a share. Net income was a record for the firm, as well as to each of our businesses even exceeding tax reform. Revenue of $111.5 billion is also record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and Card margin expansion being offset by lower markets NII. Non-interest revenues was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA. At the end of the year, the adjusted expense was $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise. And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in Cards given tax reform.  Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter. On Credit, the environment remained favorable throughout 2018. Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales.  Moving on to Page 4 on balance sheet and capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12% flat to last quarter. Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and all the enhancements. Our net payout ratio for the quarter exceeded 100% and we repurchased $5.7 billion of shares.  Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on Page 5. CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, nearly $15 billion of net income and an ROE of 28%. Customer satisfaction remains near all time highs across our businesses. For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%, Card up 6% and Business Banking up 5%. Deposit grew 3%. Growth continues to slow given the rising rate environment, but importantly, we believe we continue to outpace the industry.  Of note, this quarter, we opened the first 10 branches in our expansion markets increasing D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. And although it\u2019s clearly early, perception in the market and the performance of the new branches has been strong. Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3% and we saw record net new money flows for the year.  Card sales were up 10%, debit sales up 11% and merchant processing volume up 17% reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season. And keeping with our focus on digital everything, of note, active mobile customers were up 3 million users or 11% year-on-year. Revenues of $13.7 billion was up 13%. In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion. Home Lending revenue was down 8%, driven by lower net production revenues in a low volume, highly competitive environment.  And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense. And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII, although loan growth and margin expansion, lower card, net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve and higher Auto lease volumes. Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected.  Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies. On Credit, net charge-offs was down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across all portfolios.  Economic indicators remain upbeat. And given the breadth and depth of our franchise, we have a pretty good barometer. From everything we see, the US Consumer remains very healthy. Now turning to Page 6 on the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3 billion and ROE of 10% on revenue of $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $12 billion and an ROE of 16%. In Banking, it was a record year for both total fees and advisory fees. We ranked number one in Global IB fees for the 10th consecutive year, gaining share across all regions. Fourth quarter IB revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3%. We feel continued momentum in advisory with fees up 38% driven by the closing of several large transactions. For the year, we ranked Number 2 in wallet gaining share.  Equity underwriting fees were down 4% but significantly outperforming the market. We ranked Number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors. And debt underwriting fees were down 19% versus a strong prior year and sectors in the market. We maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and Steinhoff margin loan loss last year. A confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity. And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year. As a result, fixed income markets in particular were challenging with revenue down 18% adjusted. Weaker performance across rates, credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets. Equities revenue was up 2% adjusted, a solid end to a record year. Client continued to do well but we saw client deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash derivatives were solid in a tougher environment. Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes. Security services revenue was a $1 billion, up 1%. Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on all derivatives. Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers and volume-related transaction costs, partly offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance-based compensation. The comps and revenue ratio for the quarter and for the year was 28%. Moving to commercial banking on page seven. The commercial bank reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 20% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $4 billion of net income and a ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2%, and for prior year included a tax reform related benefit. Excluding this, revenue was up 3%, driven by higher deposit NII. Gross IB revenue of $600 million was down 1% year-on-year but up 4% sequentially on a strong underlying flow of activity, particularly in M&A. Full-year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular middle market banking which was up 8%. Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year-end although down 7% year-on-year as we continue to see migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives. We believe we are retaining a significant portion of these flows. Expense of $845 million was down 7% year-on-year as the prior year included $100 million of impairment on leased assets. Excluding this, expense was up 5%, driven by continued investment in the business in banker coverage as well as in technology and product initiatives. Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 1%, reflecting a decline in our tax exempt portfolio given tax reform. Adjusting for this, we would have been up 4%, which is still below the industry as we focus on client selection, pricing and credit discipline. But keep in mind, in areas where we have chosen to grow such as in our expansion markets, we are growing at or about industry benchmarks. CRE loans were up 2%, also below the industry as we proactively slowed our growth due to where we are in the cycle, through continued structural and pricing discipline and targeted selections as we build. Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a $106 million including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades. Moving on to assets and wealth management on page eight. Assets and wealth management reported net income of $604 million with a pretax margin of 23% and an ROE of 26% for the fourth quarter. And for the year, net income was nearly $3 billion pretax margin at 26% and an ROE of 31%. Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent, lower performance fees. These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows. Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees. For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi-asset products. Additionally, we had net liquidity inflows of $21 billion. For the 10th consecutive year, we saw net long-term inflows of $25 billion this year, driven predominantly by multi-assets and in addition saw $31 billion of net liquidity inflows this year. Assets under management of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were both down 2% as the impact of market levels more than offset the benefit of net inflows. Deposits were flat sequentially and down 7% year-on-year, reflecting migration into investments, and we continue to capture the vast majority inflows. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 13% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to page nine and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $577 million. Treasury and CIO net income of a $175 million was up year-on-year, primarily driven by higher rates. Other corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pre-tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including a $150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related. Remainder is driven by tax-related items, totaling a little over a $300 million. And within this are two notable components. The first is regularly tax reserve; and second represents small differences between the effective tax rate for each for our businesses and that for the overall company as we close the year. So, therefore there is an offset across our businesses. Our full-year effective tax rate was just a little over 20%, in line with guidance.  Moving to page 10 and outlook. We will give you more full-year outlook and sensitivity information at Investor Day as always. However, for now, I would like to provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter-over-quarter will be negatively impacted by day count. And we expect the first quarter NII to be relatively flat sequentially. While it\u2019s too early clearly to give guidance on fee revenues, it\u2019s also fair to say that this quarter market is still calmer and more positive and capital market pipelines are strong. So, if the environment remains positive, we would expect normal seasonal strength in the first quarter. But I will remind you that the first quarter of 2018 included a $500 million accounting write off as well as broad strength in performance. Expect expense to be up mid-single-digits year-on-year, obviously market dependent, primarily annualization effects. And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products. So, to close, while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform. Fundamental economic data remains supportive of continued growth, and we\u2019re generally constructive on the outlook for 2019. We have good momentum coming into the year and the company and each of our businesses are very well positioned. With that, operator, we can open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. So, the way bank stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit, which you addressed. I\u2019m wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in \u201817 and \u201818 is something that you could continue to level off to, or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we\u2019re thinking about the overhead ratio. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say a couple of things. The first is just to remind you that \u201817 and \u201818, I would look at a GAAP rather than a managed basis because of the adjustments to our revenues from tax reform. But that said, we have -- while we don\u2019t set expense target, nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that we\u2019ve been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50, so 55ish%. Obviously, the timing of that will depend on rates and markets and everything else. So, we would expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage on higher NII on growth if nothing else and continued solid growth in fees. Clearly in any one quarter, you can have pluses and minuses that can be market-dependent. But generally, over time, we would still expect those trends. Erika Najarian : And just as a follow-up question, the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the Fed was December, and I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for some time. Marianne Lake : So, I would say, first of all just to say that the question mark about whether that\u2019s a pause or a stop; is it the end of the cycle, we don\u2019t think so. We think the outlook for growth and the economy is still strong; the consumer is still strong and healthy; and we are expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward. Having said that, just as a general matter, you\u2019ve seen through our earnings at risk that as we have put more and more of the benefit of past rate cut, rate hikes in our run rate, each incremental hike from here has whilst deposited significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive, and that -- the front end SKU is a lower percentage. So, it\u2019s nothing but clearly lower front end rates or lower long end of the curve or a flatter curve, all other things would be net modestly negative. But against that, you pointed out the potential for this to lead to lower or slower reprice. So, as the Fed pauses, it is fair to say there could be an offset from lower reprice as people digest the data and understand whether this is a pause or not. We would still look -- we delivered $4.3 billion of NII growth in 2018. We will still benefit in 2019 from the annualization effects of the higher rates we\u2019ve already had as well as solid growth. So, while you kind of expect 2019 over \u201818 to be at that level, it would still be strong NII growth year-on-year. Jamie Dimon : I would say why it\u2019s equally if not more important than it was. So, if it is a pause because you are going to recession, you\u2019re going to do trades that obviously is very different than it\u2019s to pause, economy is strong and they raise rates, you know which one you would choose. Marianne Lake : And if this were the end of the cycle, it\u2019s not a cycle we\u2019ve ever seen before. So, in that scenario, if terminal Fed run rates 2.5% -- 4.5%, 5%, plus, I think we\u2019ve never seen that movie before but that\u2019s not our central case. And by the way, the house did a research view. We would still need to see incremental hike this year; if not in the first half, in the second. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe a question on the card business. There has been chatter about sort of pulling back on rewards to kind of focus more on profitability. I guess, how do you think about the strategy in cards right now? And can that -- I think the revenue yield in the card business was up 7 bps to 11.57. Can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards? Marianne Lake : Yes. I would say that when we think about the product continuum we have in the contrast, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers. Customers are very attuned to it and are looking for value in the product. Value and simplicity and ease of use are the three things in the products that we deliver. So, for us, engage relationships, drive profitability, this is still a very profitable business. So, while we will always make adjustments to our offerings, it\u2019s not the case that we are looking at a meaningful pullback in rewards. And if you think about -- think for example our banking where we are looking to bring the impact of our products together, we are continuing to offer rewards-based incentive to drive engagement with our customers. So, we think it\u2019s a solid strategy of business that already has good returns. It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve seen a lot of competitive response and competitive products in the marketplace that are driving high rewards offerings too and we\u2019ve not seen that lower -- our ability to acquire new accounts. So, we feel great about the value proposition, the simplicity and the compelling products that we have. So, it\u2019s very profitable business. Jim Mitchell : So, we think about still seeing decent growth, how do we think about card losses specifically this year? You seem pretty optimistic on credit. Should we still expect some seasoning or do you think the macro trends are that positive that we hold steady? How do you think about credit and cards? Marianne Lake : So, I think the macro trends are definitely positive. So, we are creating tailwinds, but it's also true we talked about the fact that if you go back to 2014-2015 that we had expanded our credit box, we'd expanded it intentionally at higher risk-adjusted margins. But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced that performance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in \u201818 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year that's a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations, even as late as the end of last year. So, we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310, maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019. And it will be helped by a supportive macro environment. And we are seeing, if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of three vintages. You see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates. You see the older expansion vintages that have crossed peak delinquencies and are trending to a more stable level. And then you do have, obviously with new acquisitions, cohorts that are still seasoning. That will continue. But, net-net, we're expecting relatively stable loss rate that levels similar to 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. I'm sorry, his line has disconnected. Our next question is from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Just wondering on the markets commentary, obviously super early in the quarter, but you mentioned things feeling better. Can you just talk about seasonality there but also just what feels better so far? And then, also in the fourth quarter, what you saw in leverage lending market, how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals? Little bit of color there would be helpful. Marianne Lake : Sure. Okay. So, I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad set of. And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth data was causing concerns, there were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about. So, there was a lot of negativity, we think too much negativity priced into the fourth quarter. And it started to change a bit when we saw the first really strong unemployment trend which reminded people that there's a very long distance between 3% growth and a contraction. So, yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe, a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction, and a more dovish outlook from the Fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive. And the fact that a lot of people were on the sidelines through the fourth quarter and investor appetite is out there for good value where it can be found. So, I would say just early days in the first quarter. There are still obviously risks to the outlook. And any of those things could go the worse direction. But so far, things are just a little bit more positive and that's constructive. And therefore you would hope to see normal seasonal strength in January. On leveraged loans, sort of just diving into the sort of potential for that to be hung bridges, it\u2019s true that there was a significant market correction with spreads widening across high yield bonds and leveraged loans in the fourth quarter. Clearly, stepping back, while the industry -- leveraged finance commitments are -- they are materially down from before the crisis and very different. So, credit fundamentals look pretty good. Having said that -- and by the way, we passed on a lot of deals in the fourth quarter. We've maintained sort of our sort of protection in terms of flex pricing and flex protection. And as a result, the more maturity of our bridge that has -- still got decent cushion. That\u2019s not to say that there's no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter. I would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter, given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time. So, none of the deals that we have need to be brought to market in a hurry, and the market is moving in a positive direction. Operator : Our next question is from Al Alevizakos of HSBC. Al Alevizakos : Thank you for taking my question. I again want to focus a bit on the market's performance. You pretty much mentioned like weakness across the board in credit, in FX, in rates, which I assume like is the case. First of all, I want bit of an outlook on how you think rates will perform now that volatility has picked up. And more importantly, you mentioned strength in emerging markets. Can I ask whether that was primarily in Asia or LatAm? Thank you very much. Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment I\u2019ve already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and we\u2019re expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out. With respect to emerging markets, Latin America was a big piece but Asia too. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : I guess, I\u2019m a little torn between the year and the quarter. So, I\u2019ll just ask it to Jamie. Jamie, it seems like you guys are very happy with the year with all the record revenues and earnings. But, the fourth quarter, are you happy with the fourth quarter, given expenses, credit, fees? Jamie Dimon : I\u2019m fully happy with it. The franchise is strong, we\u2019re investing in new products and services, but we\u2019re not immune from the weather and volumes and volatility. We\u2019re not immune from market prices and assets going up and down. And I like the loans up 6%, assets up, long-term flows up. I like the fact that credit card spend is up 10%, merchant processing is up 17%. Shares -- in almost every business, market shares have gone up. That\u2019s what I look at. I really don\u2019t pay that much attention to speed bump it a little bit but the fact that volumes were low in the last three weeks of December. I honestly could care less. I look at more in equities. We\u2019ve gained share and we\u2019re now bumping up to number one. Those folks have done a great job, of course cash, derivatives, prime broker et cetera. And fixed income has maintained our share and we\u2019re adding products and services around the world. And we don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to happen next quarter and I don\u2019t care. Marianne Lake : And we take the same division, we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend. And so, we don\u2019t really react to the sort of micro, even though it was driven by the macro. The really underlying business drivers continue to be strong. And even in those businesses, we are holding leadership positions and gaining share. And so, this too will cost and things will continue to move forward in a constructive manner. Mike Mayo : As a follow-up, let\u2019s talk about the weather. So, the weather is lousy at the end of the year and Jamie you were just appointed to your third year as Chairman of the Business Roundtable. So, in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about, having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, December is terrible but if you look at January, you have half of it back, generally in spreads and markets and stuff like that. And as BRT, I don\u2019t do anything that benefits JPMorgan. That\u2019s about public policy, that\u2019s good for growth of America in total, and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there. But the BRT does take up trade and we are supportive of the fact there are serious issues with China. We would like to see the trade deal get done. It looks like to us they are marching along at least to this March 1st deadline date that enough will be done to kind of get an extension and hopefully complete the deal. We would like to see immigration reform, so proper border security, allowing people who have advance degrees to stay here, having the doctors stay here, having more merit-based immigration and having some path to citizenship. That is the BRT position. We want more innovation. We\u2019d like to reduce regulations at the local and federal level that stop small business formation. So, if you look at the BRT, there are 10 verticals around that -- and we try to do things that are good for the growth of America.  And bad policy can slow down the growth of America. I have pointed out over and over it takes 12 years to get the permits to build the bridge. And it took eight years to put a man on the moon. It is time that we reform ourselves and not blame anybody else for own lack of that we don't have kids getting at school of educations where they get jobs, the innovation has slowdown, the government R&D spending is down. I always think what can you do better and there is plenty in this country to do better to help growth over the long run. And it\u2019s not about helping it next quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Follow-up on John\u2019s question earlier on leverage lending. On slide 24, you see the balance on loans held for sale go from like $6.5 billion to $15 billion. I heard your comments on marks. I'm assuming that that is just disruption and you go back towards your normal level that's in the pipes and progress, but I just want to make sure that I'm not making that wrong assumption. Marianne Lake : Yes. We are not expecting anything to be elevated. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. And\u2026 Jamie Dimon : That number goes up or down over time just based on episodic -- what is cleared out of the books. There is nothing in our number we are afraid of. Glenn Schorr : Understood. Curious on the credit on the couple of marks and C&I, I'm just curious on how much of that is internal versus external rating agency. And I guess, it's a feel for the underlying fundamentals. How do you know we should treat that as idiosyncratic as you go? Marianne Lake : So, it\u2019s internal and it\u2019s like lines, sectors. We know the specifics, it is situationally specific. Remember, just to give you some context, while those can drive the dollar value, regular way in any quarter given the size of our portfolio, we might downgrade and upgrade hundreds of individual names based upon the circumstances. So, when we say that we are looking at it and saying that things are idiosyncratic, it\u2019s not just looking at the five situations that drive the biggest sort of value, it\u2019s also looking at the hundreds of downgrades and hundreds of upgrades and seeing if there is any trends or net worrying concern, and honestly not now. Then, so if anything, marginally, we had more upgrades but it\u2019s just -- there is nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we are looking. Jamie Dimon : We look for reasons to put up reserves, not to take them down. Marianne Lake : We are more paranoid than you are. Glenn Schorr : Last one, obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze-ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years. But, I'm curious how you all think the markets functioned in general? In other words, things went down, spreads widened out, there was lots of fear but it felt like the plumbing was working. But, I don't want to put words in your mouth. Jamie Dimon : And half the people weren\u2019t even here the last two weeks in December. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s right. The plumbing was working; we didn\u2019t see any sort of technology issues; we didn\u2019t see any volumes that can be coped with. While I said that there was a lack of debt to markets and liquidity, that\u2019s typically the case when you have one way trends in the market and there are people similarly situated. So, I would say they relatively functioned well, but challenging. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Andrew Lim : I just had a follow-on question from the vesting high yield mark's question. You seem to be getting the impression that there weren\u2019t really much in the way of marks. Is that because you\u2019ve got very strong hedging strategies in place and that the decline in FICC revenues mainly was due to lower volumes? Jamie Dimon : There were no marks. Marianne Lake : There were no marks. In our business right now, we have -- for the vast majority, we have good cushion and we expect to be able to a clear and price through market. And anything that even border line, it\u2019s completely not material. Jamie Dimon : I think there are few marks, if you look at what happened to flex pricing like mid-December when things were the worst, yes, some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing. And that means they are very close to have you some kind of mark. Of course, since then, the spreads have come, come back 40%. Marianne Lake : Right. Andrew Lim : Interesting, thanks. And then, my follow-up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending, the growth has accelerated quite nicely. Do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves because they were shut out of the market? Marianne Lake : I mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year, you saw it in the industry data, we saw it in our spot data. For us in fact, it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing I would call -- nothing that I would call unusual or a trend. We didn't have to take down things that would otherwise not play in the market. Operator : The next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the expense flexibility. I think in your base case, you're pretty clear that you're targeting positive operating leverage and moving down the efficiency ratio to the mid-50s. But, what is some of the expense flexibility and where would it come from, if the revenues slide. I think in 2018, you accelerated some technology spend, given tax reform, you've been opening branches. Some of that stuff obviously can't be pulled back, but you always talk about some areas of flexibility. So, maybe what are those? And if you could kind of size or help quantify some of the flexibility you have, that'd be helpful. Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say, first of all that you saw that from 2013 through \u201816, we had a pretty structural expense reduction program associated with simplifying our businesses. So, in terms of the low hanging fruit and things like that, we would say largely that\u2019s been harvested. We are always looking to generate core operating efficiencies so that we can absorb growth. And when we are investing in technology and data, one of the reasons to do it, customer satisfaction, product innovation aside is efficiency. So, we are seeing some of that come through. We\u2019ll continue to drive that down. Jamie Dimon : But the efficiencies and the investments are all in the number that Marianne gives you when she says up 5%. Marianne Lake : That\u2019s right. The way I would say it is that we continue to drive for expense discipline. But as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making which we think are strategically important for long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting clients, if those are good decisions for long term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that. And so, marketing expense for example is one area where you would say there's pretty sizeable and immediate flexibility. Nevertheless, when we invest in marketing, we're driving new accounts and engage customers that drive long-term growth. So, we invested through the cycle. We think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we'd like to continue to do that. 2019 over \u201818, you wouldn't expect to see necessarily the same clip up that you saw last year, we did accelerate investments in \u201818 and so more of the growth will be revenue related but still decent investments as the opportunity is still good to do that. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on a sidebar here on the reserve build as we think about credit quality, are we just in the period now where we should assume kind of some reserve build consistent with loan growth each quarter or was this just a quarter where you had a couple of the lumpiness that really drove? I guess what I'm getting at is, last quarter you had modeled -- I guess what I'm getting at is like, it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe it's a bit unusual still. Marianne Lake : So, first of all, I'd sort of point out that in the cost base we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid-single-digits, the seasonality. There is seasonality to card balances and losses. And so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year. That's what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year-on-year than last. And in the wholesale space you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have. I wouldn't necessarily say that we expect to see a trend from significant reserves but we've been factored by recoveries and releases over the course of the last couple of years partly or in large part at least earlier releasing reserves we took on energy when the energy went through the downturn. So, we'll have some downgrades. We might have some releases. I would, net-net, think that as we grow, we would build but not this proportionally. We\u2019re obviously at a best point in the cycle. So, Jamie mentioned it earlier, to the degree that we have the flexibility, we\u2019re making sure that we are reserved accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : A lot of talk on macroeconomics and the policy backdrop in volatile markets, but as you mentioned earlier, you guys are in a pretty unique position and that you have pretty consistent dialogue with a lot of economic agents whether it\u2019s corporate, governments, institutional investors and whatnot. But just a sense of what your clients are saying, what are they concerned about? Is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self-fulfilling effect and that it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or recession? Marianne Lake : I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive and so I think should be good. But for sure, investments is not immune to external factors. And so manufacturing data has been a little weaker I would say. CapEx is sluggish on sales around global growth. Government shutdown and trade are not particularly help, uncertainty is not good to anyone. So, there is no doubt that as things continue, if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty, it\u2019s just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market. I wouldn\u2019t say that I think it\u2019s clear and present. But I think we should be extremely careful because sentiment particularly consumer sentiment will be incredible important. And right now it\u2019s good, sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from I hope small middle market companies that while not at their high, but still very high. Saul Martinez : That's helpful. If I could just ask about loan growth and is it just a more-broad question about your ability to continue to outpace the industry? And I suspect we\u2019ll get more color at Investor Day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side, you maybe scale back a little bit, maybe we\u2019re late cycle. But, where do you feel like you can continue to outgrow the industry, where do you feel like maybe it's time to scale back on risk a little bit? Marianne Lake : So, I think it\u2019s -- and incredibly nuance question, because in general, home lending has a challenging market backdrop. For us, it\u2019s tale of two cities. We\u2019re doing quite well and gaining a bit of share in the kind of retail purchase market. And we\u2019re holding the pricing discipline corresponding and leading share there. So, there is a challenging market backdrop, card was doing well at and it\u2019s sort factor of all things we talked about, investments in digital product, rewards all of the above. So, we would like to believe that we will continue to hold our own there. And auto is extremely competitive. We play in prime, super prime space. And we\u2019re seeing competition from people who have different economic drivers in our sight, credit unions and captives. And so, we\u2019re willing to lose share to maintain returns there. You bifurcate C&I, we\u2019re growing in line, we\u2019re best in the industry in our expansion markets where we\u2019ve been making the investments, where we\u2019ve been adding specialized industry coverage. And we would like to see that because of the investments we\u2019re making. But in mature markets we\u2019re again being pretty prudent. I won\u2019t call it tightening but being very selective. And commercial real estate, particularly construction lending, yes, we\u2019re tightening. We\u2019re being very cautious about new deals and selective about it. So, it isn\u2019t the case anymore that we would say we\u2019re seeking to grow, although we ever were, loan growth is an outcome of number of factors, mainly the strategic dialog with our companies but also the environment we\u2019re in and it\u2019s extremely nuance. And in many of our businesses, we\u2019re going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point. Jamie Dimon : So, maybe I\u2019ll just reemphasize that. We tell our management that we have no problem seeing loans books shrink. We\u2019re not going to be sitting here ever in our live to say and you got to grow the loan book, you got to show loan growth. Remember, Warren Buffett used to say in the insurance business and sometime it\u2019s true in the loan business, you\u2019re better off the sales force go play golf than there to make new loans. We\u2019re not going to be stupid. And the other thing you have to always keep in mind, it\u2019s not the loan, it\u2019s the relationships you look at in total. So, when it comes to middle market or all these other things are reasons that we stay in a business knowing there is going to be a cycle and we are not going to be children on this cycle. We know that losses are going to go up. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Are we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away? Jamie Dimon : Credit is pristine, mortgage credit is pristine, middle market is pristine. Underwriting has been pretty good other than a few little pockets that Marianne has mentioned. We saw people stretching in auto, we saw some stretching in -- and we\u2019re not going to self fund credit card, but little bit people are stretching in that. And leverage lending, we\u2019re not worried about all loan book. I think you can have a logical conversation. But there is kind of a nonbank loan book. But that\u2019s not our concern. And it is what it is at the time\u2026 Marianne Lake : And I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship driven. So, think about kind of no new relationship, commercial term lending real estate banking, mortgage to a lesser degree also. We are seeing -- we are losing or seeking share where it makes sense to do it. Jamie Dimon : Yes. And competition, we mentioned this before, it\u2019s back everywhere, and that\u2019s a good thing for America. And that means the pricing is little tough and you have compete. Betsy Graseck : Yes. So, we are still off the golf course, all right. That\u2019s good. Just wanted to understand a little bit more on the expense side. I know it was -- even with the weather, you guys put out a 14% ROTCE, which is obviously best-in-class. The question is on the expenses, there is flexibility there but yet I know you\u2019ve guided to up single digits in 1Q \u201819. Based on the prior conversation, it seems like 1Q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should I take that that\u2019s kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year? So, why would 1Q be a little bit different I guess is really the question? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I wouldn\u2019t fully annualize the first quarter. But think about we\u2019ve added bankers and advisors across our businesses. So, you\u2019re going to get annualization impact, particularly first quarter to first quarter. We have added more and more as the year progressed. Similarly, something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business, revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter. So, front office, auto lease, some of the technology investments we have making, the annualization of those will be more pronounced first quarter to first quarter than fourth quarter to fourth quarter because many of them are in our run rate in the fourth quarter. And then outside of that there is a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy. And then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there is going to be timing. So, the first quarter will be higher. I wouldn\u2019t annualize it. We are going to see nicely growth year-over-year much more because of revenue growth than the corporate investment of both year-on-year, not the same level as last year. And we will obviously give you a lot more detail and insights and thoughts on ranges and everything at Investor Day clearly. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question on the balance sheet; I\u2019m if you gave us already. But just walk through the idea of lowering down the deposit with banks and kind of moving into repo, what you saw in the quarter and then kind of is that just something that was temporary, that\u2019s expected to reverse in the first quarter? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, it\u2019s fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter. And so through the quarter and that year-end, we will able to take advantage of the market opportunity to move out of cash into cash alternatives, things, reverse repos and short duration assets. And so, for us, it was yield-enhancing opportunity to redeploy cash and a mix change rather than adding duration. And that continues to be the case into the first quarter. It contributed to our NIM expansion in fourth quarter. We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and it\u2019s a market opportunity. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then, a separate question on, I know it\u2019s not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking, you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter. Could you just give us some color there, what drove a negative gain on sale? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, in the quarter, and as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to GSE of about $5 billion. And the impact of that was perhaps a loss on the sale of the portfolio, given that they'd been originated at lower rates. So, as rates are higher, the fair value of the loan is lower. Against that, if you were to look at the rest of the P&L, you'll see a benefit in net interest income because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the Treasury Department. So, it's geography, it's a loss on the sale of a portfolio against which there's funding breakage in NII. Just so that you know, when we -- our mortgage loan with RWA 50% versus security at 20% with better liquidity value, we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage-backed securities in treasury. So, we will earn that back over time, net for the company. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So, I wanted to start with just a bigger picture question on credit and the impact of normalization. Certainly, the near-term guidance sounds quite encouraging. Jamie, you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over-earning on credit, not particularly a controversial remark. But in the past, you guided to a medium-term loss rate blended basis of roughly 65 bps. That does contemplate continued loan losses in commercial. And just given that we\u2019re late cycle, I was hoping you can maybe speak to your expectation for what a normalized credit loss rate is for JPMorgan, given your current mix and where that might differ from your medium-term loss guidance? Jamie Dimon : So, we're not talking quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019re just taking in general trends\u2026 Steven Chubak : I'm talking in bigger picture. Jamie Dimon : So, Marianne has shown year-to-year we consider it normalized losses. And for years, we've been doing better than that. In credit card, middle market, large corporate, mortgage has come back down to a very low number. And at one point, it's going to go up. And so, I'm not -- we're not telling you what's going to happen next quarter. Right now, it looks like it\u2019s kind of steady state. But at one point we will not be surprised see it go up. I don't know if it could be second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, and I don't know if we\u2019re relate cycle. We don't exactly know where we're in the cycle. And so, we just won\u2019t be surprised to see it go up. And the number -- if we look at it by product, we're looking at a total that can actually -- may vary against the total. Marianne Lake : I think, I hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day but we -- when we gave our medium-term simulation we said listen, we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium-term guidance is for 17%. We under earned against our guidance in other parts of the cycle. Maybe we\u2019ll over-earn against it. But NII and repo bags are higher and credit is benign. And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers. So, we don't know when it will be and actually don't see anything that -- I know you say in the second, third or fourth quarter. There's no indication that it's in any of those quarters. But, we'll have a more comprehensive discussion at Investor Day about range of total outcomes. Steven Chubak : We're looking forward to that. And just one follow-up for me on the IB outlook, Marianne, I was hoping I could unpack to some of your comments around the -- how the IB backlog. You cited that as being quite strong. But just looking at the individual businesses for M&A, ECM, DCM, especially given some the economic pressures outside the U.S. what informs your outlook across each of those? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say that first of all, we did see, given the conditions in the fourth quarter, a number of deals that got pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, particularly in ECM and DCM, in M&A there was a bit more balance so every deal that got pushed or stopped, there were more that came to take its place. But as a result as we go into the first quarter, pipelines across the board are elevated relative to last year and pretty strong. And at the end of the day, we talked about earlier, confidence is still high, companies are still motivated to drive growth. And so, the environment should be constructive for continued M&A. Technology, healthcare, biotech innovation, technology innovation, momentum in ECM that we've been benefiting from and the IPO pipeline should continue market dependent. And notwithstanding December, actually a sort of lower outlook for rates in the U.S., should broadly be a tailwind for fixed income in the first quarter, the first half. So, the second half of the year, I think is going to be determined by how things shape up over the next several months. But looking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses. Jamie Dimon : I think potential backlogs, generally, you want them high because that\u2019s good, but they\u2019re all like an accordion, too, they come and go. So, that\u2019s not a forecast for the future that you\u2019d definitely get those revenues. They could get delayed, particularly things like IPO that you\u2019ve already seen. I just want to point out, the shout out to the folks in the investment bank, our market share went up in Europe, Asia, Latin America and United States last year. That\u2019s what we really look at when we look at the business. Marianne Lake : 60 basis points full-year. Jamie Dimon : 60 basis points all year. And first time ever, it went in all four major in markets. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Jamie, I was glad that you mentioned that we don't know the red end of the cycle because that's kind of just assume because of that lapse of time, but not really the economic factors. And then the other piece of this is, when you look at losses, they tend to be good until they go into recession. Then, they are bad. There is no just kind of normalization. So, the question about a normal rate of loss that we really have two dichotomous answers. We have a good answer, which is when we\u2019re expanding and the economy is stable, and we have a bad answer or recession. It's kind of one or the other. Just want to see what you thought about that. Jamie Dimon : You\u2019re exactly right. At one point you\u2019re going to over and at one point you\u2019re going to under run. And we try to -- when we look at the business, we kind of try to price through that. So, we\u2019re trying to earn fair returns through the cycle. And I totally agree with you. We know it\u2019s going to -- they are going to change at one point. And we try to do a better job underwriting too but we do work hard and make sure we underwrite other people as best we can. Marty Mosby : Which then limits the volatility when you go into that bad period, which is what you want to do. You underwrite to make sure you're defending against that cycle. Jamie Dimon : Exactly, and the other one you have is the reserves. You put them up, you take them down. So, our total reserve is what 14 billion? But at one point they were 30. So, we went from -- in the great recession, went from 7 to 30 back to 14. And I call it income paper. It doesn\u2019t mean advantages, but when you go into that recession, your losses go up, any reserves have to go up. And we\u2019re completely aware of that. Marianne Lake : Although I think we have to say, for obvious reason, that we wouldn\u2019t expect any near-term recession if there is one to anything like it did before. And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolio, performance will be not only absolutely better but we think strong on a relative basis. Jamie Dimon : Other than -- if you look at the consumer, that $13 trillion that's outstanding, other than student, which is fundamentally owned by the government, the more stuff that's been written is prime. So, back to $10 trillion, it is much better than what it was in \u201807. And I think credit card, I forgot the exact numbers, much more prime than was in \u201807. I think order is about the same but order actually outperformed, more prime and outperformed in the great recession. I think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time. I think if you start a recession soon, going into it, the credit portfolio is much stronger than last time. Marty Mosby : And the follow-up question to that is, we talked about auto and some of those other places where you saw some of that deterioration, what our model showing is that actually the discipline and the reaction time to that deterioration is much quicker than when we saw the one to four family cycled the last time where you saw deterioration but growth just kept going. We had so many banks jump in and say, look, we\u2019ve already pulled back on auto lending, we pulled back on multifamily. There have already been places where you\u2019ve seen that discipline. So that discipline in itself put the governor on economic growth, which is why we're having less growth or slower growth but yet it also creates a like you said, a stronger portfolio for that eventual downturn. Jamie Dimon : I agree with that. Lack of discipline we see is in student and a little bit in small commercial real estate. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys -- there has been a lot of talk about leveraged loans and how this time around everything seems to be underwritten better. Are there any tangible statistics that you can share with us or maybe on Investor Day you might do show us that yes the leveraged loan portfolio for you guys in particular is much healthier than maybe \u201806-\u201807? And then, second, on this leverage loan issue, outside the banking industry, what are some of the indirect hits that you and maybe some of your peers may experience, none from the direct hit of the leverage loan but for some of the craziness that's going on outside the banking industry? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, can I just give a big picture of this? I think $1.7 trillion of leveraged loans, okay. So, term A is about half of that. These are very rough numbers, okay, most of it with banks, and obviously safer than term B. A big chunk, over I think 60% or 70% of the term B is with nonbanks. And so, if you look at your at banking system, if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in \u201807, it was over $400 billion; today's it\u2019s number like 80. In \u201807, there were commitments and no flex and everyone has plenty of flex now. So, we look at covenants, so it\u2019s kind of covenants but there\u2019s flex and there is a whole bunch of stuff in there. So, it is far, far, far sounder today. Even these CLOs, you look to underwrite the CLOs, they are far better underwritten with more equity, more sub debt and more mezzanine stuff like that. And go to shadow banks, they do things like differently. A lot of those folks are quite bright, they know what they're doing. Someone is going to get hurt there. And the issue there is in the next recession because the -- and remember, most of the major banks don\u2019t fund a lot of that. We aren\u2019t taking huge indirect exposure to that by funding some of the nonbanks. And I think the issue there is for the marketplace it\u2019s going to be -- when you have a recession, the lender will not be there. So, a lot of these borrowers will be stranded. So, that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s an opportunity or risk or something like that but it\u2019s not -- I wouldn\u2019t put it in the systemic category. Again, if you go back to \u201807, we -- it emerged in \u201807 there was $1 trillion of bad mortgages that were kind of all over the place, the CLOs, SIBs. There are no SIBs. The CLOs are much smaller. The leverage lending book is much smaller book. Capital liquidity is much higher. So, it is nothing like \u201807. You will have a recession, it just won\u2019t be like you had last time affecting the banking system. It will affect the banking system. We are little bit canaries in the coal mine. We are not immune to what goes in the economy. But it won\u2019t be anything like you saw last time for most of the larger banks. Gerard Cassidy : No. I agree with that. And do you think Janet Yellen and other Federal Reserve officials comments about leveraged lending is more directed to the exposure outside the banking industry than inside the banking industry? Jamie Dimon : Yes, I do. Marianne Lake : Yes. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Again, I don\u2019t think they were saying it\u2019s huge and systemic. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s something that you should keep an eye on. I think that the regulatory do keep an eye on that. Gerard Cassidy : And then just to pivot on deposit question. Obviously, noninterest bearing deposits are tough to keep as rates are going higher. Can you guys give us some color on the non-interest-bearing deposits? There is obviously a small decline. What parts of the business you're seeing there, and the Fed\u2019s unwind of its balance sheet, how much of an impact do you think that might be having on the non-interest-bearing deposits? Marianne Lake : So, the migration into product from noninterest to interest bearing is predominantly or largely exclusively a wholesale thing. At this point there is not enough rate benefit in the interest bearing savings to drive into product migration, definitely some growth outlook in CDs given pricing, but it\u2019s wholesale right now and it\u2019s mainly rate-related and not balance sheet in terms of the Fed unwind. Jamie Dimon : Can I just make a comment about interest rates and the balance sheet of Fed? So, the interest rate is one thing but the balance sheet of Fed obviously is causing changes in the flow of funds. It\u2019s causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two-year and three-year bond yields for corporate -- government bond is much higher, some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk. So, changing the whole bunch of fund flows concerns people, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s part and process of normalization. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : There were couple of Fed or regulatory documents out in late December, one is codifying the three-year burning of stated seasonal impacts and another one where they are pushing out till \u201822 on their own implementation of CECL accounting in the supervisory stress test. I was just wondering, just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way CECL goes and how it looks, aspirations around that and how that interacts with CCAR and such? Jamie Dimon : Before Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year. Ken Usdin : I\u2019ll pass that along, Jamie. Marianne Lake : Following that -- it\u2019s hard to follow, I would say that we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcomes that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase. So, having a transition is obviously helpful. You should imagine that we would likely avail ourselves of that opportunity. That is what it is. For me, the question that needs to be clarified is if we are to include the impact of CECL in company run stress test, but the Federal Reserve is not going to include it in the stress test, we need to kind of understand the insight between those two things, particularly if that might coincide with a turn in the cycle in actual fact. So, I think we're looking for continued clarity from the regulators about what exactly that means. If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks. And you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics, secular change, that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business. And we should worry about that. Jamie Dimon : It'll be a big number for like credit card. So, if you put 3% now on when you build the loan book by $100, the number would be 6%. Some number in the future will be much higher. So, I do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically how they run their loan books through that. Marianne Lake : So, our view is that more on that needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like. I hope that what was meant by we should include it in company run stress test is for us to collectively learn and for the regulators to have the time to respond to that. But remember, 2022, considering all the discussion we've had on this call about the cycle, how long the cycle is, when there's a turn in the cycle, and we could actually face a stress before that. And so it's great that they are waiting a bit, but it might all be a bit of an academic point depending on what happens actually. Ken Usdin : Yes. That's a fair point. And Jamie you've also said in the past that you guys lend on accounting -- don't lend on accounting and lend on economic, but there's this kind of challenge to that that Marianne just mentioned about the unintended consequences. And so, it would be interesting to see that if there is in fact the point where banks don't lean in as you just mentioned, Marianne. Jamie Dimon : They will change. Marianne Lake : Yes. And we have the luxury or the flexibility of being able to say that we can continue to lend based upon the underlying economics but someone who has a differently situated balance sheet and return profile may not be able to do that. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : A follow-up on the net interest margin, two sides to the question, one is commercial loan pricing. I guess, it's been kind of brutal you\u2019ve had the BDCs, private equity firms, loan funds all computing. Has there been any let up with some of the dislocation the capital markets late in the year. And the other side, retail deposit betas, Marianne, you thought they would get a lot worse. I don't think it's been as bad as you thought. What was your retail deposit beta and what do you still expect? Jamie Dimon : Before Marianne answers that can I just go back to the cyclical stuff? It's not just CECL a lot of things that have been built and since the crisis were really good, there was more pro-cyclicality built into it. And so you're going to see the next downturn that we have a far more pro-cyclical accounting, liquidity and rules, and rules capital and stuff like that, which we don't know the full effect of that. But if I was a regulator, I would be very cautious about constantly building pro-cyclicality into the system. And I gave you the example, it's our loan books, they're going from 7 to 30 or whatever they went to back to 14. It will affect how people respond to in the downturns. And it will cause people to pullback much quicker than maybe in the past in total. Marianne Lake : Okay. So, just on your question, so corporate loan spreads, I would say, we did see sort of pretty brutal grinding down in corporate spread. But over the last actually couple of quarters, we saw them find a bit of an equilibrium and stabilize at levels. So, while, I would say it\u2019s still true to say that there is a lot of competition, at least in the space in which we\u2019re operating we\u2019re seeing spread at relatively stable levels in the corporate space. And honestly I don\u2019t remember saying that I thought we would see an acceleration that was dramatic in retail betas in the short-term. Obviously at some point when the when we have this level of rates and the spread between market rates and rates paid get to a certain level and if normalization continues, we would expect to see repo flags catch up. But, we have not seen that yet outside of CDs in retail phase right now. Mike Mayo : And the way you calculate it, what was your retail deposit beta this quarter and how does that compare to the past? Marianne Lake : So, in checking and savings and lead savings, it\u2019s nothing. In CDs, it\u2019s something but around to a very small number. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Just a quick follow-up, Marianne. Have your investment bankers on the front lines passed on any concerns about the government shutdown? There is reports that the SEC is not open. And is that slowing down the investment banking business and your thoughts on that? Marianne Lake : Yes. So, I would say that we\u2019ve been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs in particular. But for sure, if we don\u2019t see the ability to get approvals from SEC on IPOs and to a lesser extent some of the M&A deals that need approvals from government agencies, it will be problematic in the ability to see those activity levels play out and fees be realized. So, it\u2019s one of many things that would behoove us to end this sooner rather than later. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. Marianne Lake : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to take you through the earning presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on page one, the firm reported record net income of $9.2 billion and EPS of $2.65 and record revenue of nearly $30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. The results this quarter was strong and broad-based. The highlights include core loan growth ex-CIB at 5%, with loan trends continuing to progress as expected. Credit performance remained strong across businesses. We saw record client investment asset in consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter, and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes, up 10% and 13% respectively.  We ranked number one in Global IB fees and gained meaningful share, which are well above 9% this quarter.  In the commercial bank we had record growth IB revenue, in asset and wealth management record AUM and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage. Turning to page, two and talking into more detail about the third quarter, revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year, driven by net interest income which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix.  Non-interest revenue was up slightly as reported, but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NII would have been up 5%, reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while market revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting. Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we are making in technology, real-estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fee charges of a little over $200 million.  Credit remained favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale. Credit costs of $1.5 billion were up $330 million year-on-year driven by changes in wholesale reserves. In Consumer charge-offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserves this quarter. In Wholesale, we had about a $180 million of credit costs, driven by reserve sales on select C&I client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy. Once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names and across sectors. Net reserve sales of this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolio and we are not seeing signs of deterioration. Moving on to page three, and balance sheet and capitals. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.1%, up modestly from last quarter, with a benefit of strong earnings and the AOCI gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk-weighted assets.  RWA is up primarily due to high accounts cost of credit on trading activity, but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis.  Quarter-on-quarter loans were down in Home Lending as a result of a loan sale transaction in the CIB as a result of a large syndication and in Card and Asset & Wealth Management seasoning.  Also in the page total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, basically driven by higher CIB trading assets in part and normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions. Lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances, including higher security. In the quarter the firm distributed $7.4 billion of canceled shareholders, including $4.7 billion of share repurchases, and our pre-submitted our 2019 CCAR capital plan for the Federal Reserves.  Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on page four, CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30%, with consumers remaining strong and confident. Core loans were up 4% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending and Products both up 6% and business banking up 3%. Deposits grew 3%, in line with our expectation and we believe we continue to outperform. Client investment assets were up 13% driven by record new money flows reflecting both across physical and digital channels including new invest. We also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets.  Revenues of $13.8 billion was up 9%; Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII driven by continued margin expansion; Home Lending revenue was down 11%, driven by net serving revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR, but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing.  And product Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 9% driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes. Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4%, driven by investments in the business and also lease depreciation, partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On Credit, net charge-offs were flat as lower charge-offs in Home Lending and Auto were offset by higher charge-offs in Card on loan growth. Charge-off rates were down year-on-year across lending portfolios. Now turning to page five under Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion and an ROE of 16% on strong revenue performance of nearly $10 billion. For the quarter IB revenues of $1.7 billion was up 10% year-on-year and outside of an accounting nuance, all of advisory, DTM and total IB fees would have been record for our first quarter. Advisory fees were up 12% in a market that was down, benefiting from a number of larger deals closing this quarter. We ranked Number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly a 100 basis points of wallet share.  Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down, driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leverage finance. We maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share.  And Equity underwriting fees were down 23%, but in the market down more as a combination of the government shutdown, uncertainty around Brexit and residual impact from December volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter. But already in the second quarter we\u2019ve seen a major recovery in US IPO volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and Healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar. Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.5 billion, down 17% reported was down 10% adjusted to the impact of the accounting standards last year that I referred to. Big picture, on a year-on-year we basis we are challenged by a tough comparison. Backlog in the first quarter of \u201818 was reported, clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance which a clear record in equity last year.  In contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept flying from the slide lines despite and recovered in more favorable environments. And with that in mind I would characterize the results are solid and a little better than we thought at Investor Day just a few weeks ago, largely due to a better second half of March. And for what it\u2019s worth so far, the environment in April, sales general constructed but it\u2019s too early to draw any conclusion in terms of P&L.  Fixed income markets revenue was down 8% adjusted, driven by lower activity, particularly in rates and in current fees and emerging markets, which normalized following a strong prior year. However we did see relative strengths in credit trading and strong flow, as well as in commodity.  Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, seeking more to the record prior year quarter and this quarter\u2019s performance, which was still generally strong across products. Although it got off to a somewhat slower start, cash in particular nearly matched last year\u2019s exceptional results.  Treasury services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefitting from higher balances and payments volume, being partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue was a $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of the business exist. Of note, deposit margin in both treasury services and security services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firm wide level there is an offset.  Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4% driven by lower performance based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business. The comps and revenue ratio for the quarter was 30%. Moving to commercial banking on page 6. A strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit NII. Record Gross IB revenue of over $800 million was up more than 40% year-on-year due to several large transactions, and the pipeline continues to stay robust and active. Deposit balances were down 5% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, as migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives has decelerated and we believe it\u2019s largely behind us. From here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook. Expense of $873 million was up 3% year-on-year as we continue to invest in the business and the banker coverage and in technology. Loans were up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. C&I loans were up 2% or up 5% adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. We continue to see solid growth across expansion market and specialized industries. CRE loans were up 1% as competition remained elevated and we continued to maintained discipline given where we are in the cycle. Finally credit costs of $90 million was predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underline performance. Before we go on, I want to address the perceived seat gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we all see in the fed weekly data. If we look across all of our hotel business, we also show strong growth year-on-year at about 8%, but there are three comments I would make; the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data; second, CIB is a big contributor for us, and CIB loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans. And third, as previously noted, the definition of C&I for the Feds does not include our tax reform portfolio, which has seen significant year-on-year declines given tax reforms.  So while it\u2019s true that the Fed base was showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples ROE, in the domain stream middle market lending phase we are seeing good, mid-single digit demand in line with our expectation.  Moving on to assets and Wealth Management on page seven. Assets and Wealth Management reported net income of $661 million with a pretax margin of 24% and an ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as lower management fees on average market levels, as well as lower growth brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains. Expense of $2.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year but continued investment in our business, as well other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees. For the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $10 billion with strength in fixed income, partially offset by outflows from other asset classes. Additionally we have net liquidity outflows of $5 billion.  AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both records of 4% driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long term products and with third quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.  Deposits were up 4% sequentially on seasonality and down 4% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments, although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of inflows. Finally we had record loan balances up 10% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Moving to page eight in corporate. Corporate reported a net income of $251 million with net revenue of $425 million, compared to a net loss of over $200 million last year. The increase was driven by higher NII on higher rates, as well as cash deploying opportunities in the treasury. And recall last year we had nearly $250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter. Expenses of $211 million is up year-on-year and includes the contributions to the foundation of $100 million this quarter.  Concluding on page nine, to wrap up this is a sort of quarter that really showcases the strengths of the firms operating model, benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda. We delivered record revenue and net income in a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter.  Underlying drives across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in March and coming into April the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructed, client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum.  Deposits grew is only six weeks behind us, so our guidance for the full hasn\u2019t changed. We do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm\u2019s performance.  With that operator, we\u2019ll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from a line of John McDonald with Autonomous. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your Jamie's letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio on each of the main business units for the next few years. Just kind of wondering what's driving that? Is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that's going to occur in 2020 or is this just kind of positive operating leverage carrying through. Marianne Lake : Hey John. So I would say just big picture it\u2019s a combination of both obviously. We told at Investor Day about the fact that you know we're always going to make the net investment, the net incremental investment decision base based on its own merits, but in total with the amount we\u2019re spending now and the amount of dollars that rolled off every year that get repositioned for investment. We feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is positive. Obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology you know are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but that also has to do with operating efficiency and we would also expect to start to see some of that drive, you know operating leverage. But it\u2019s also the case that we are looking for revenue growth, so it\u2019s a combination of both. John McDonald : Okay, and then just on the NII outlook, it's reassuring to be able to hold the Investor Day outlook of the $58 billion for this year even though your curves flattened, there was some concerns there. What are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we are seeing? Marianne Lake : Yeah, so I mean the first I would say is that you know, we probably said it before and we\u2019ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that, it\u2019s a big dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so. And so in the big picture we said, you know $58 billion plus. Yes, it\u2019s true that a persistence that the curve would have a small net drag on Carry and we are not immune to that. So there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that, if it is persistent at this level throughout the year, but you know we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that, there is a mixed bag of lower for longer.  So while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on you know basis necessarily and while now longer and the rates maybe a net small drag in the short term on earnings, that\u2019s a credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient FED and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle. So net-net there are pluses and minuses. I would say there may be some pressure and as a results that if it\u2019s persistent, but its modest. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi! You mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over $20 billion year-over-year, so those are the numbers. I just \u2013 I was hoping for a little bit more on the why, and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches, how is that deposit growth going, how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength, I know that came up during the CEO hearing, the IMS study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail? Thank. Marianne Lake : Yeah, so look I will say there\u2019s lots of different opportunities for people to get ensured deposits. So you know, we\u2019ll come back to the other point, but all of that plays a piece. So you record that we build a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets being California and Florida and Nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we are definitely seeing you know some growth in deposits there.  By also firmly believing we talked about it many, many times that we\u2019ve been investing you know consistently over the last decade in customer experience, customer satisfaction in our consumer bank is at an all-time high and continues to increase consecutively. Digital products, new products and services, value propositions to our customers, convenience, new market, all of which I think are you know increasingly important to our customers, as well as obviously you know not a number of other factors.  So you know to me it\u2019s a combination of all of the above and less so you know at this point of perception of a flight to quality, the people have a lot of choices. Year-over-year I would say you know we are see deposit growth grow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdowns speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and are little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives. So customers are voting with their business, they are brining deposits to us and I think it speaks to a combination of the investments we are making and also including any branches. Mike Mayo : So how much in that deposit growth is due to digital banking? Can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure? Marianne Lake : Well I can tell you that \u2013 and so it\u2019s not just about deposit growth as well remember. It\u2019s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there. So I don\u2019t have a breakout for you; we can follow up. You know it deepens at our branch, both you know the reason why we continue to believe in a fiscal and digital you know combined channel presence, both are important, but we can get back too. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. On sec services I heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on rev\u2019s down. Could you talk about the business exit? I wasn't aware that and how big that is and then flip to the better side, you also did mention that organic growth. We haven\u2019t heard too much since the big trillion dollar win, but I know there is stuff going on underneath the covers. Talk about what type of business you are winning there? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So on the business aspect, this is you know \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a feature of always talking about year-over-year. To me this feels like really old news. It was a U.S broker-dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago, but obviously we are still on a year-over-year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues. It\u2019s about just over $20 million year on year revenues negative impact, but it's you know relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit that took place last year.  Lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on the revenues. And then we are seeing solid underlying growth, but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our asset from \u2013 you know our custody asset and as we are growing and winning new mandate, these are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mix. And so there is a bunch of factors going on.  What we are focused on is so both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well, and even with these revenue pressures we are focuses on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good ROE businesses, you know above mid-teens. I\u2019m sorry, can I just make one more comment? I didn\u2019t say this on the digital space, but you know I think it\u2019s important as we think going forward that you know as we think not just about our digital assets, the digital account openings and that is being a feature of how we are attracting new accounts 25% of checking production, 40% of savings production, now able to be open digitally. So increasingly digital will be a driver, but we will get back to you with that. Glenn Schorr : Marianne, just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in DC. Besides finding out Jamie's a capitalist, that\u2019s shocking news, one of the risks that I think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non-bank lending and I just wanted to get a little qualifier of that \u2013 I'm pretty sure you didn't mean the exposure JP Morgan has to those, it\u2019s just more risk being taken, but if you can just expand on that, that would be helpful. Marianne Lake : Yeah and for sure, the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risk to you know those sectors and our risks are all the things that we\u2019ve always told you about which are relatively modest, relatively senior, well secured, well diversified. We look at you know losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable. The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market, and while you know we wouldn't say necessarily that that's systemic, being not systemic and suggesting that there won't be problems are two different things. Not all non-banks are situated similarly, so there are some healthy fighting, well-capitalized, well and responsibly run companies, and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn. So the real question for all of this business that has migrated outside of banks, is you know how much of it will be unable to be rolled over, refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now? So it's not about us, but it's about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward. But for a variety of reasons whether it's structured, whether it's capital liquidity pricing, that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market. Jamie Dimon : Yeah, so can I just take the big numbers, put those rolling, so obviously regulators keep an eye on it, and we are not particularly worried about it, but just to give you some facts. The banks \u2013 there\u2019s a $2.3 trillion. The banks have generally the senior piece or the A piece of about $800 billion or $900 billion.  Then institutional investors, some of them are quite right. You know these are life insurance companies, funds, etcetera, owned BPs about $900 billion, and there's $500 billion what they call direct, and think of these as large funds. For the most part large funds, some are very capable, very bright, they have long-term capital.  In the institutional piece that I mentioned, a lot of them are CLOs. I know that people are worried about that, but if you actually look at the CLOs, there\u2019s more equity in those CLOs, they are more funded and both the direct piece and the CLO piece is more capital, permanent capital, so the system is okay. It's just getting bigger as more outside and regulated judgment. It should be something that should be watched, but it's not a systemic issue at this point. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I had a question for Jamie. Jamie, in the shareholder letter, you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages, and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward. Could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you're thinking about there? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. So if you look at the business, I mean it is just costly. You have 3,000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements; it is litigious. Just look at history, you can see that, and it's becoming a huge -- non-banks are becoming competitors, and they don't have the same regulations, the same requirements in the servicing or production. So you're having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset. So we just, we just want to \u2013 we know it\u2019s an important thing for a bank. We also want \u2013 and also we standardized capital since a lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital; it's just a capital pod. Far more than it should be, if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages.  So we just want to have our eyes open, look at that, go through every piece, and structure it in a way that we're very happy going forward. We don't mind the volatility; we don't mind staying in the business, but you got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, separate topic, but just a question I wanted to ask because I got a couple of questions on it yesterday. The whole group of CEOs was asked, who do you think could succeed you? Would a woman or would a person of color succeed you? And I don't think you raised your hand. I just wanted to understand why and just hear from you, you know why you answered the question that way? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. So what I should have said is that we don't comment on or speculation on succession plan. That's a Board level issue. It's not something you do in Congress, where you play your hand out in Congress. But also I was confused by the question likely without a timetable. So we have exceptional women, and my successor may very well be a woman or it may not and it really depends on the circumstance of time, and it might be different if it's one year from now versus five years from now, so that's all that was.  I think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that. So I mean still go and work in other several people on the operating committee who can succeed me. Betsy Graseck : Thanks, I appreciate that. That's the answer I expected you we're going to give, but wanted to hear it from you, so I appreciate that. Thanks. Jamie Dimon : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on the remarks on the mortgage business. We did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and Marianne, I know you spoke at Investor Day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans. I'm wondering, is that what's really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So mortgages in 2018-2019 are the epicenter of it, for mortgage. So the market itself is more year-on-year. It's about 15% smaller, because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates and still higher year-on-year than they were this time last year. So that obviously is having an impact and as we've been -- and we're down similarly.  So we've added about $6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolios. But against that, as you saw last year, we did a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet. We're trying to take loans off of our balance sheet, core loans of our balance sheet, and sell them if we can reinvest in agency MBS and non-resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics.  So it's going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend. You're going to need to look at things grow. So we are originating high quality loans. We are adding a number of loans to our portfolio; we're distributing based on better execution as that would go, but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet. Steven Chubak : Very helpful, and just a follow-up for me on CCAR. The Fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year, including some higher Card and Auto losses in the upcoming exam. I'm just wondering, how does that inform the way you're thinking about capital return capacity. And are you still confident in that sustainability of 75% to 100% net payout as well as the 11% to 12% CET1 target? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here is what I would say. Steven Chubak : The Card and Auto losses. Marianne Lake : Yeah. So I applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the Fed model losses for our portfolios. And we've been observing that over time. Necessarily, it's the case that the Federal Reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily, because they are industry wide.  Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first. So, we are growing our businesses responsibly. Every time we're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisors across our businesses. But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing changed. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. Good morning, Marianne. A quick question \u2013 I know you mentioned that the increase in NPLs within Wholesale was again idiosyncratic, but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter. Is there a way you can give more color as to the specific drivers in there? I know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you're off a low base. I got that, but I mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So, the color is there is really no color, which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil, gas, energy releases out, you would've seen you know quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are $100 million in between. So there's always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades.  The thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have, whether we're seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow, and whether we're seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we're banking and we're just not. So, it's not to say that we aren't playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle \u2013 it's not to say, we're playing close attention to retail, but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter. And even if you look quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter there's no trend to call out and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio. These are extremely modest in the context of that. And remember every quarter, like we talk about a few, because it's non-zero, but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter, and it's not just downgrades, it's upgrades, and they are approximately of equal measure. So we're looking very carefully at it. I think we understand why people are questioning, concerned, and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle will turn, but we're not seeing it yet. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a separate question in the mortgage banking; it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point as over the last five years this quarter. Was that something in the market? Something with the rates or was there a one-off impacting that number this quarter? Marianne Lake : So, you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and as geography. In the Home Lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we're match funded, net-net there's very little P&L. But last quarter, there was a loss in NIR and an offset in rate funding in NIR, this quarter there's a gain. So you've got a loss quarter, gain this quarter, both small, but nevertheless that's driving the majority of the production margin going up. But in addition, if you just strip all that noise out, which is not material, but nevertheless significant quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Marianne. Marianne Lake : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us -- obviously you've got your de novo branching strategy moving forward. And what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So we're really, really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the United States. But when you talk about branches, you are talking about investment for the long-term, and when I say long-term, multiple years, decades. So with respect to the new markets that we're entering, these are extremely nascent investments, the branches, in many cases we haven't even broken ground on.  However that said, early indications, very, very early indications are strongly positive. We're seeing a lot of excitement in the market. We're seeing new accounts in production, a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage. On the whole, you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, and then following up on some comments you made at Investor Day, and I believe touched on today about technology spending. If I recall correctly, next year technology spending should be self-funding and stabilized at just about where you are today. When you compare it to the past five years, what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology? Nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years? Marianne Lake : So, I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past, but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit.  With that said, we've been growing our technology spend, and in particular we've been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank. And that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital, R&D and the whole lot. It's a large number, and each year a lot of the dollars that we've been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them. So, this is not that we're going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very, very heavily in the agenda, and in particular in the technology agenda. It's just that each year [Audio Gap] and we'll continue to make the right decisions, and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Marianne Lake : And we're getting more efficient. So in the past the way the technology was delivered was very different, and the more that we're in, our modern virtualized cloud-ready way with new technology, each dollar of technology is more productive. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Alevizos Alevizakos : Hi. I've got a quick question and a follow-up basically. My question is on the Treasury Services, year-on-year the growth going from double-digit you just grow to 3% where apparently the volumes remained healthy, but the margins started to deteriorate. I wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019, especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic. Do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double-digit growth year-on-year for the remaining quarters?  And my follow-up question is, we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for IT budget. Can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you're spending on innovation? Thank you. Marianne Lake : Yes. Okay, so first point on Treasury Services last year revenue growth was in double digits. You're right, this quarter fixed on year-on-year. I mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that is just given where rates have moved maybe a headwind this year as the segment results are reported, but for the company it's obviously net zero. The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue. So you will see margins really compressed on that. It's not speaking to deposit flows, it's not speaking to volumes and it's not speaking to escalating payouts at this point. So we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business. With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank, and it's more 50-50 this year, so $11.5 billion of spend about half and half. Alevizos Alevizakos : Thank you very much. Marianne Lake : Remember, in the change of the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D, so it's the whole spectrum. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the net interest income, and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter. Is there anything that's lumpy or one-time that you'd flag? Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target of $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now. Marianne Lake : Okay, so we did slightly better in the first quarter, two things driving it. One is small but nevertheless is arguably non-recurring, which is we talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales, that net-net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in Treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it $50 million approximately. And then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that was high-yielding than IOER, that continued into the first quarter. So we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue, but we're not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through.  So I would say that day count was a drag. As you look forward with some opportunities, honestly obviously I do see that there is a risk associated with the flat yield curve, not big, but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure, its long end rates stay lower for longer.  As we don't have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the December rate hike, you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter, so there are risks and opportunities. We still think it's a decent outlook, but I don't think it's conservative. I think its -- $58 billion is straight down the middle at this point. The trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short-term and we shouldn't over-interpret or over chase it. At this point I think it's a decent estimate and we'll continue to update you. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities. Are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago? You clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook? Marianne Lake : Well, I mean we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago. So, the sort of overall answer is, no, not really. We expected at that point that we would have a patient fed. It turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which couldn't generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet. Obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration, but there's natural drift in our balance sheet there. So overall very little, we feel good about the credit. The curve is flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up, Marianne on the comments. In the backdrop for lower rates for longer, could you give us a sense on how you're thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale? In other words, I know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter, but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time? Marianne Lake : So, I'll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing and our consumer behavior than what we're seeing in deposit flows. And so that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening, and you know you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives, whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue; we'll continue to watch that.  It is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end, and it's the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda. So even if the curve is flatter, as long as it's because the front end is stable, I don't necessarily see deposit costs going down, but we're going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And my follow-up question is, we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non-accruals was idiosyncratic, and I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year? Marianne Lake : There are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of extremely low base and so from that any movement whether they are up or down, it's somewhat exaggerated. But we would continue to call the credit environment benign. Erika Najarian : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Marianne just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to \u2013 can you split that between just what you're seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of, the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year, some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown, you are just still saying quite good. And then there is this unevenness about just CapEx and spending and corporate side. So just could you just kind of walk us through just where you're seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement? Marianne Lake : Yeah, I mean I think that as it relates to U.S. and in particular looking at the U.S. consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, Auto, Housing, spend, all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it's double-digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see that - and can see the confidence by the way, which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters.  So for us, U.S. Consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we're not all-time high and confidence is still very high, and generally the beta is - and even some like housing and also that hasn't necessarily been super strong, is looking encouraging. And then on the global front, it is a little harder, but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit, and Europe would be a good example, we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in Brexit, and they seem to be fading a little, business confidence has recovered a little, businesses are still spending on labor, so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers.  And even there there's job growth, there's wage growth you know helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased. So, I think, generally we feel optimistic across the Consumer and the rest of the sector, albeit it's sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy. So, t's early, but it's what we were expecting to see and so it will continue. Ken Usdin : Yeah, and one follow-up just on Investment Banking business. You had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we've seen the reopening of the ECM market. Your general outlook just again on that global point about the, bit unevenness between US and global. Just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today? But had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter, but how is that side of the business you're feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective? Marianne Lake : Yeah. So, I would say that a couple of things. Obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that. But just as a general market matter, M&A is still attractive in a low growth environment, albeit a growth environment, investors are still constructive. North America, which is by far the biggest market for M&A is still healthy and so, Europe was a big driver last year and Europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue, although we have a pretty good position there. So I would say that the pipeline is down, but still M&A is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth. Ken Usdin : That makes sense. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the NII outlook. I mean I think we've talked about a flat curve. What kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating. It doesn't sound like you're in that camp, but if you were to get a rate cut, how do you manage that? How do you think the balance sheet reacts and NII reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months? Marianne Lake : Right. So the market which is usually more, you know I would say pessimistic, but more in that camp, they are still only expecting and ease at the end of the year, so we are not by the way as you point out. So, I think for 2019's NII outlook, it's not a clear and present danger and there will be a need.  Obviously we have on the way up on rates been over-indexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have any, it would have an impact on our NII. If we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in, then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet. But right now, the fed is on course. Right now that's constructive for corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit, and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet. Jim Mitchell : It's still you like you have room to, I guess, extend duration to kind of protect NII and NIM if that would happen? Marianne Lake : Yes, yes, we do. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Alright, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Matt's question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness. This is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint, earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus, especially in CCB, but there weren't a lot of obvious non-core items really called out. So Marianne, can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren't necessarily called out during the call. You mentioned corporate, cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there. So are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call in the question how sustainable the results are? Marianne Lake : So first of all just sort of big pic, first of all really high I think is a bit of an overstatement \u2013 higher I think is fair. No, not really if there were, you know we would have called them out. There are a few little things, so I'm just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned. We contributed $100 million to the foundation this quarter. Net-net legal was a very, very small, but nevertheless positive this quarter, so there's a few little bits and pieces like that.  But if you look at revenue performance, we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting. We did better in IBCs and we gained a lot of share; we did a little better in markets; we did a little better in NII, so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon.  Probably my best answer to you is, as happy as we are with the performance, and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses, we are not making material changes to our full year outlook. So we'll still see how markets performed for the year. We do still expect, as Dimon mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter. Coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5% and 10% year-on-year. So, we do expect to gain share to help offset that, but last year was a record.  So we haven't changed our full year guidance at all yet. We'll take this as a very good down payment to that. And if markets are constructive and wallet expands we\u2019ll benefit from that, but\u2026 Saul Martinez : Okay. No that's... Marianne Lake : We're not leading it across and changing everything. Saul Martinez : That's helpful. I'll change gears a little bit. Any update on distressed capital buffer, what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal? Marianne Lake : So the best I know, there is a chance, but not necessarily a probability that there could be an SCB proposal for 2020 CCAR. So there's a set of meetings or a meeting that\u2019s coming up sometime in the summer that I think might be an important moment. But we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point-in-time capital, but it's complicated.  You know as we said the most important thing is not to issue an SCB proposal, it doesn't deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively. So we're talking about GSIB, we're talking about minimums, we're talking about Basel, we're talking about SCB, it's complicated. I'd say there's a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 CCAR. Saul Martinez : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marianne Lake : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, good morning. First I want to ask as going to CCAR, now we're getting into that season again, one of the things that I think has an impact is that, what we had was a significant 30% plus growth in earnings last year. So if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward, and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant, doesn't that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year? Marianne Lake : I mean yes, yes. If you look at payout ratios, obviously it's sort of described as a percentage, then we said over the longer term, we'd expect to payout in a benign environment between 75% and 100%, and analysts have estimates of 90% plus. And obviously as earnings grow, that would be a bigger dollar number.  But again, we'll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise. So we'll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds. But you're right, as earnings continue to grow, a strong payout ratio, we're above the top end of our capital range. So we are starting at a robust level, would be a higher dollar number, yes. Marty Mosby : And then, Jamie, I was just curious. I think one of the issues facing the industry, and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time. And so if we look at it, I think there's things that you're seeing or Marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon. So just wanted to get your comment on that as well? That's my follow-up question. Thanks. Marianne Lake : Yeah Marty, go ahead Jamie. Jamie Dimon : Yes, some sort of number that's out that\u2019s there in Australia had growth for 28 years. And just so I'm saying in notional, but you have to have a recession. Now they've had a lot of back winds, there's growth in Asia and stuff like that. But if you look at the American economy, the consumer's in good shape, the balance sheet's in good shape, people are going back to the workforce. Companies have plenty of capital, and capital expenditure is still up year-over-year, little bit less this quarter than last quarter.  Our capital is being retained in the United States. Business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all-time peaks, rather high. So you can just easily, it can go on for years. There's no law that says it has to stop.  We do make a list, and look at all the other things, geopolitical issues, lower liquidity. So there may be a confluence of events that somehow caused the recession, but it may not be in 2019, 2020, 2021. Obviously at one point though there will probably be something, and yeah I think the bigger short-term risk would be something to go wrong in China, the trade issues in China. So, I just wouldn't account them to having to be a recession in the short run, couple of years. Marty Mosby : I agree, thanks. Operator : Question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Andrew Lim : Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on the end-of-period loans. So if we look across the board, it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter-to-quarter basis of about 3% of 4%. And I was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4Q '18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to company CEOs where you secrets reemerging again. Marianne Lake : Yes. So quarter-on-quarter \u2013 and I think I mentioned a couple of these things, but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis loans are down. So like stepping through them, the first one I would point out is mortgage, and we just talked about that I think earlier in the call, which is we continue to originate mortgage loans and continue to distribute them on portfolio. We did do a loan sale, which is part of the discussion that we've been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet. We did a sale at the end of the quarter, so that's impacting mortgage loans.  In the CIB and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex-CIB is because we don't consider CIB loans core, it\u2019s because they are just by their nature often times more episodic and lumpy, and so we did see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter. And then, in our other businesses in Asset & Wealth Management, a bit of seasonality, a few pay-downs in Card seasonality. So it's just sort of combination of factors, but I would say two drivers, CIB and Home Lending, CIB on sort of a large syndication, Home Lending on the loan sale. Going forward we'll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes. But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, you know I look at the middle-market space and say, we're still seeing solid demand. It is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we're still growing that portion of our loans in the mid-single digits year-on-year. Andrew Lim : Yes. Great, thanks. So my following question is on. Marianne Lake : Before you go into, there are going to be other areas where we just won't roll out. I mean in Commercial Real Estate, you see loan growth is much lower; it's very competitive; its prices have come down. We continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans, but we're not going to chase it down and similarly Auto. Andrew Lim : Sure. Okay, thanks. So my follow-on question is on CLOs. So as some Japanese institutions are big buyers of U.S. highly rated CLOs, but a few weeks ago the Japanese FSA introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5% risk retention by U.S. issuers in order for the Japanese institutions to buy them. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing yet any change in demand from Japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from U.S. CLO issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5% risk retention. Marianne Lake : It\u2019s a great question. The answer I'm going to give you is not that I'm aware of at this time, but I'll have to follow up with you. Jamie are you aware? No? Sorry Andrew, we'll come back to you. Not that I'm aware of, but it is a good, but nevertheless quite detailed question. Andrew Lim : Okay, thanks. Marianne Lake : Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Marianne Lake : Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Before I get started, I\u2019d like to thank Marianne for nearly seven years as CFO and for her support of me over many years, but particularly her support during my transition into this role, so a huge thanks to Marianne. Jamie Dimon : Yes, I just want to add my thanks too. I think Marianne, as we all know, did a great job - smart, honest, thoughtful, helped make the company a better company, so all our thanks goes to Marianne. We also all know that Jennifer is going to do a great job, too. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, Jamie. Okay, so now on to the presentation, which as always is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $29.6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Included in these results are tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits. Adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter. Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; number one in global IBCs year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets. Overall for the firm, total loan growth was 2% year-on-year but down 1% sequentially. It\u2019s important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm. Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage. Now on to Page 2 and some more detail about our second quarter results. Revenue of $29.6 billion was up $1.2 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was up approximately $900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix, as well as higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up approximately $300 million year-on-year, largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment we took in the prior year. Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, non-interest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production, and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IBCs as previously guided.  Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.1 billion down 5% year-on-year. In consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat as higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases. And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters. Once again, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale.  Now on to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with a CET-1 ratio of 12.2%, up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.5 billion of capital to shareholders, and as you know, the Fed did not object to our 2019 CCAR capital plan. We are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to $29.4 billion over the next four quarters, and the board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to $0.90 per share, effective in the third quarter. Now on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%. Loans were down slightly year-on-year driven by home lending down 7%, reflecting the loan sales I just mentioned; however, card loan growth was healthy, up 8%. Business banking loans were up 2%, and auto loans and leases were flat. We saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 16%, growing across both physical and digital channels. Card sales were up 11% as growth remained strong across key products. Across the franchise, active mobile users were up 12% year-on-year given continued engagement in our new features. For example, customers have opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally, activated over 60 million Chase offers, and our enrollment in credit journey now exceeds 18 million. Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 11%. This increase included two notable items that largely offset. First, the current quarter included a negative MSR adjustment in home lending driven by updates to our model inputs; and in the prior year, as I mentioned, we had a rewards liability adjustment in cards of approximately $330 million.  Consumer and business banking was up 11% on higher deposit NII, driven by margin expansion. Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances. In cards, merchant services and auto was up 18%. Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11% driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes.  Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4% driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. Of note, the overhead ratio was 52% and we delivered significant positive operating leverage.  On credit, this quarter included a reserve release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $400 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in cards of $200 million. This was primarily driven by growth, and to a lesser extent mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were up $212 million. Excluding the recovery on a loan sale and home lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up $80 million driven by card, as we continue to grow the portfolio.  Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 5, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.6 billion. As a reminder, our performance was particularly strong last year, which featured record or near-record revenues in overall IBCs and equity markets. With that in mind for the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year in a market that was also down. Advisory, debt underwriting, and equity underwriting fees were down 15%, 13% and 11% respectively, reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10-year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year. It\u2019s worth noting on a year-to-date basis, we continue to rank number one overall and have gained share across all products and regions, benefiting from our continued investment in bankers.  In advisory, we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank. In debt underwriting, we also rank number one, benefiting from our strong lead [indiscernible] position in leveraged finance, and in equity underwriting we have seen significant pick-up in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and healthcare, where there has been robust activity. Looking forward, the overall IB pipeline is healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and lease financing opportunities in debt underwriting. Dialog with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue.  Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.4 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the IPO of Tradewind. Excluding this gain, markets revenue would have been down 6% year-on-year against strong second quarter performance last year.  Fixed income markets were down 3% on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in EMEA partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading, due to the changing rate environment. Equity markets was down 12% against a record second quarter last year. [Indiscernible] client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year-on-year decline in equity derivatives; that said, cash in prime remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all-time high. Treasury services and security services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 4% and 5% year-on-year respectively, with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression. As a reminder, similar to last quarter, deposit margin was primarily impacted by funding basis compression rather than client betas, and at the firm-wide level there is an offset.  Sequentially, treasury services was flat and security services was up 3% on higher balances and fees. Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. The comps revenue ratio for the quarter was 28%. Now moving onto commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances. Also worth noting here, gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity, and we continue to progress solidly toward our long-term $3 billion target. Deposit balances were down 1% year-on-year and importantly up 1% sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total, although we continue to see migration to from non-interest to interest-bearing deposits. Expenses of $864 million were up 2% year-on-year driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology. Loans were at 1% with C&I loans being flat, or up 3% adjusted for the continued run-off in our tax-exempt portfolio. The story here remains unchanged - we saw solid growth in areas where we\u2019ve been investing, including expansion markets in specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activities. CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending, where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective, given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $29 million with a net charge-off rate of 3 basis points. Now onto asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $719 million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market leverage was offset by lower investment valuation gains. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees. For the quarter, we saw record net long-term inflows of $36 billion driven by fixed income, and we had net liquidity inflows of $4 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7% driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels globally. Deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 1% year-on-year, and similar to the commercial bank, balances in total have largely stabilized. Finally, we had record loan balances up 7%, with strength on both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now onto corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $828 million, including the vast majority of the tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year. Expenses of $232 million were down $47 million year-on-year. Finally turning to Page 9 and the outlook, on this page I\u2019ll just comment on NII, which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment. As you can see, we are updating our 2019 full-year NII outlook to about $57.5 billion. The reduction is based on multiple scenarios which assume, among other things, lower long end rates and up to three rate cuts this year, which is consistent with current market sentiment. As a reminder, this compares to a rate scenario that assumed zero cuts at the time of first quarter earnings.  To wrap up, the U.S. consumer remains healthy, overall credit is in great shape, and the earnings power of the company is evident. We delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment. Understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook, we still expect to grow the franchise and will continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology, bankers and beyond. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you feel is driving that uptick, and do you think how sustainable is it at sort of 8% year-over-year growth. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so on card loan growth, we feel very good about what we\u2019re seeing there. As we talked about at investor day, we have a real opportunity with our existing customers, and we talked about how our existing customers have about $250 billion of borrowing off us. About $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback, so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers, and for the first time, we\u2019re actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers, and so we\u2019re really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day. Jim Mitchell : Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment? Jennifer Piepszak : On the mortgage business, I would say it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent but I would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged. And so, we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about de-risking the portfolio from a servicing perspective, so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesn\u2019t change the overall structural challenges. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back to what you were saying earlier in that your guide--or your guide lower is including up to three rate cuts this year, which would suggest to me that your net interest income is quite defensive in the face of rate cuts. I guess my first question is, could you give us your primary assumption for that $500 million swing, particularly on deposit pricing? Jennifer Piepszak : Okay, sure. First of all, I\u2019ll take you back to the first quarter where our guidance was $58 billion-plus, and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point. That pressure has persisted and in fact increased, and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook, and then on the short end the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad, and so we thought about a range of outcomes of one to three rate cuts, and so you can think about -- if it\u2019s one cut, $57.5 billion-plus, and if it\u2019s more, $57.5 billion-minus. Then based on current advice, you can think about the third quarter as being $100 million to $150 million below the second quarter, and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point. Then in terms of betas, largely speaking you can think of betas as being symmetric, and so on the consumer side we saw little re-price on the way up, and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down. On the wholesale side, if you look at large institutional businesses like treasury services and security services, we are largely at full re-price there, so there should be opportunity there. Then in places like the commercial bank and asset and wealth management, we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed, but we have started to see re-price tick up there. But importantly, I would say we\u2019re not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we\u2019ll see how it goes. Jamie Dimon : And it\u2019s all embedded in your assumptions. Jennifer Piepszak : And it\u2019s all embedded in the [indiscernible]. Erika Najarian : Got it. Just going back to Jim\u2019s question, I noticed that investment securities balances continued to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%. Should we think about this as part of the overall, you were saying optimizing capital and liquidity and therefore as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some relief in RWA growth and some relief in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so on the RWA side, yes, that is precisely why we\u2019re doing it, and so when you see the loan sales in home lending, yes, they are offset in securities purchases which are more efficient from a capital perspective, as well as a liquidity perspective, so yes. Having said that, on reserves - I mean, reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that, because of course that will depend upon the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains. Jamie Dimon : I would just add, our standardized capital ratio is 12.2, advance is 13. Advance is obviously a far more important relevant economic number. It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and you can\u2019t securitize. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. The efficiency ratio went from 56% to 55% year-over-year, and I guess that\u2019s with some accelerated tech spending, so do you plan to keep this pace of tech spending going, and what\u2019s the current update on that tech spending? Where is it connecting, where is it not connecting, because I think you said you\u2019d accelerate it for a couple years and then maybe we\u2019d see more of the results in 2020, 2021. Jamie Dimon : Could I just take that one? It\u2019s about $11.5 billion today, I think it was a little bit lower last year. If we had to say what it is today for next year, it\u2019d be something like $11.5 billion, and I think it\u2019s always becoming more efficient, but what you really have in tech is some things are becoming cheaper all the time and then you\u2019re also investing money all the time, which we\u2019re going to do regardless of the environment, so we\u2019re not going to cut things we\u2019re trying to build, like My Rewards programs and Chase My Loan and the credit journey because there\u2019s a recession or something like that. Daniel Gordon will tell you right now that they think they get more efficient spend, and we shouldn\u2019t [indiscernible] whatever you want, but we will be happy to spend to win in this business, and we\u2019re very efficient, [indiscernible] how we spend in technology. We\u2019re going to do it regardless of the environment, and we\u2019ll probably get more efficient in tech spend too. Jennifer Piepszak : That\u2019s right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest, and we talked a lot about AI and machine learning - it\u2019s early innings there and there\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re going to be able to do to invest there and become more productive, and then cloud, developers can become more productive using the cloud. Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s amazing - our [indiscernible] costs with all the things going on in the world today are down because effectively of AI and [indiscernible] and stuff like that, and so it\u2019s hard to [indiscernible]. You mentioned You Invest, you look at our client investment assets grew 16%, a portion of that was You Invest, and obviously You Invest cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, so you\u2019ve got to put all those things in perspective about how you start making decisions going forward. Mike Mayo : Then a follow-up, Jamie, you mentioned the environment, all the things taking place in the world. How is the environment now? I mean, on the one hand you have a trade war, you have lower interest rates, you have capital markets which are down to the big banks, you have a lot of pessimism; on the other hand, you highlighted your results. When you take the temperature of the environment, what\u2019s the temperature? Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s not that bad. You know, uncertainty is a constant. The one thing in life is you know it\u2019s going to be uncertain going forward, and geopolitical tension is kind of a constant. Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal, but what I think we see is global growth is north of 3%, you kind of expect the United States to be 2.5% this year. The consumer in the United States is doing fine, business sentiment is a little bit worse mostly probably driven by the trade war. You travel around the world, you know, Japan is growing and Europe is growing a little bit, and Brazil has gone from negative-4 to zero. A lot of countries have opportunity to expand. They don\u2019t have to be great but they should be doing better [indiscernible], so I wouldn\u2019t get too pessimistic yet.  Obviously the Fed will react to the data they see, and I would say it\u2019s more important what\u2019s going on that just what the Fed does. If the Fed\u2019s cutting rates and we\u2019re going to recession, that\u2019s not a good rate cut. IF the Fed actually raises rates one day and we\u2019re booming, that\u2019s not so bad. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it, but I think total average loans were up 2% year-on-year, but that was impacted by the loan sales. Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year-on-year without that? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, there\u2019s a few things going on in loan growth, as you say, Glenn. We have the loan sales, we also have the run-off of the tax exempt portfolio, so you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4% if you adjust for those items. Importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that we\u2019re seeing in terms of the areas where we\u2019re investing, and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex-CIB of 2% to 3% full year. Glenn Schorr : Okay, appreciate that. Just curious - on the non-interest bearing deposits only being down 2% year-on-year, we\u2019ve seen a lot bigger numbers at some peers. Is that just strength of JPMorgan\u2019s franchise or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift? Jennifer Piepszak : As I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AUM. We are still seeing some migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but largely we\u2019re seeing those balances stabilize, and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank. The second quarter is typically seasonally high in the consumer bank, so we have some growth in non-interest bearing there, and even in the consumer bank where we\u2019ve seen growth decelerate, that\u2019s largely as a result of consumer spending, so that feels healthy as well. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Maybe last one. Appreciate the guide on 2019. Because it\u2019s a half, if you looked forward into 2020 with no incremental rate cuts, is it remotely linear? In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate and curve environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to over-simplify like that? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, it\u2019s probably more complicated, Glenn. Just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are, and importantly if we\u2019re looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about, so we\u2019re not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thank you, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning. When you take a look at your merchant services business, you had some really strong growth year-over-year - I think it was up 12%, and then your card volumes excluding the commercial card were also up very strong. Can you share with us what\u2019s driving that strong growth, that double digit rate of growth? Jamie Dimon : Thanks for noticing. Jennifer Piepszak : I would say that is firing on all cylinders, so it\u2019s brand, it\u2019s people, it\u2019s product. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy U.S. consumer as well, and in fact retail sales this morning look strong, so we can expect that to continue. Gerard Cassidy : Is it more the market as you just referenced - the retail sales, they were strong - is it more that, or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, we have taken share, a little bit of share in card. As you know, we\u2019re number one in sales there. I think importantly, what\u2019s helpful in card is that we don\u2019t even need to take share to grow, just given the secular tailwind that we have in the card business on the electronification of cash, and we\u2019re taking share in merchant acquiring. Jamie Dimon : And we expect to take more share in the future. Gerard Cassidy : Speaking of the future, can you guys give us some color on what your first read of Libra is, the Facebook announcement about the payments system that they\u2019re going to initiate? Jamie Dimon : Yes, so to put it in perspective, Gerry, we\u2019ve been talking about Blockchain for seven years and very little has happened, and you\u2019re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on it. We don\u2019t mind competition and the request is always going to be the same - the governments are going--you need one level playing field, and governments are going to insist that people who hold money or move money all live according to rules where they have the right controls in place. No one wants to, a, [indiscernible] terrorism or criminal activities, and that\u2019s going to be true for everybody involved in this, and that\u2019d be banks even doing [indiscernible] for a long period of time, and those [indiscernible] I think will just become for everybody at one point, and they should. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous. John McDonald : Hi. I wanted to ask about the CCAR, and you got a big authorization this year. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET-1 target, the 11 and 12 that you\u2019ve talked about? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. As we think about capital distribution, first we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses, and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend, and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders. We are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that $29.4 billion to shareholders; having said that, we are still targeting the upper end of the 11 to 12% range. We\u2019re always going to want to have a management buffer, because as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses, and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework.  Then importantly, we wouldn\u2019t actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters, given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over four quarters, but as of now we are still targeting the upper end of 11 to 12%. John McDonald : Okay, thanks Jen. Any updated thoughts on FISO, or could you remind us what your thoughts on initial impact there? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so haven\u2019t changed from investor day. Our range continues to be $4 billion to $6 billion, and we\u2019re prepared for the January 1 implementation. Jamie Dimon : Just to [indiscernible], so CCAR is one test a year on stress. We do 120 a week, so we are always prepared for stress. CCAR has us losing $20 million or $30 million over nine consecutive quarters. I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made $20 million to $30 million, and CCAR assumes you\u2019re going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes you\u2019re going to continue your dividend and stuff like that. We have plenty of capital - I mean, our capital cup runneth over and we\u2019d [indiscernible] that capital. Remember, things like opening branches, for every branch we\u2019ll eventually use $10 million of capital, so four new branches will eventually be $4 million of capital, so restraints on growth also restrains on capital usage and the ability to finance the U.S. economy, so we\u2019re really optimistic about our ability to somehow use our capital, including like the InstaMed acquisition we just did, which I think closes sometime soon, so. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Jamie, you mentioned about Blockchain, we\u2019ve been hearing about it for seven years and not much has happened, but I think you at JPM have built a Blockchain solution for at least your correspondent banks. I guess I wanted to understand where you think you\u2019re planning on taking that. Right now, it\u2019s just an AML KYC use case, but is that something that you think you could deliver more functionality over, over time? Jamie Dimon : We think the Blockchain is real, and the reason it takes so long is people have to agree to the protocols, you have to write a lot of code to get into it. The one you\u2019re referring to, IAN, is think of an information network for banks, so right now banks transfer live information among each other - think of trade finance and correspondent banking and stuff like that, so I think we have 120 banks signed up, we\u2019re going to have 400. So right now, it\u2019s for bank wholesale use to have immediate information, we all have the same information, you can move things; but eventually, you\u2019ll be able to move money quicker with data, so yes, we\u2019re optimistic about that and we\u2019re going to roll that out as soon as we can and constantly test it and make sure it\u2019s secure and all that.  I remind people when it comes to moving money, JPMorgan Chase moves $6 trillion a day quite securely and quite cheaply. You\u2019ve got to look at the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, but people legitimately said, well, you didn\u2019t have real time payments - that was true, and now we do effectively sell from P to P, and we do effectively [indiscernible] real-time payments in TCH, so we are building the things that the future is going to want - APIs, Blockchain ledgers that have much more data, real-time moving of money that also goes through floor checks, etc. We\u2019re quite optimistic about it. It\u2019s going to take a while to get everyone using it. One day it\u2019ll have to be opened up to a broader customer set, possibly. Betsy Graseck : One of the things that\u2019s coming out in these senate and house financial services banking committee meetings is this desire for real-time payments, a desire for a cheaper solution for payments, and that\u2019s supposedly what Libra is going to offer; but to your point, it seems like you\u2019re already doing that. The question is, how do we think about the outlook for interchange, and is there--you know, what\u2019s your strategy towards interchange pricing here as we go over this, through this period? Jamie Dimon : [Indiscernible] there is real-time P2P free save and secure [indiscernible], so when people say do it, that\u2019s already done. That\u2019s not cross-border, so there are people who might want to do that cross-border, and cross border remittances are much, much smaller than actual use of debit card, credit card payment systems here, [indiscernible] built in real-time payments is actually already in use. To me, the issue there is going to be fraud - you know, to make sure with these real-time payments, you also put it through effectively real-time floor checks and stuff like that.  You know, in the United States, credit cards, debit cards, people love these cards. The beneficiary is the consumer. Always remember, that\u2019s who we\u2019re here to serve, and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards. They use their credit cards far more than they use their debit cards. I don\u2019t remember the last I used my debit card. Betsy Graseck : Yes, when you get rewards, it\u2019s great. Okay, thanks. Jamie Dimon : And at JPMorgan, they\u2019ll be getting more free stuff. You get free--you can buy and sell stock for free. We just gave you a very good--it just got rolled out, we only have a few accounts, but local investing, very cheap, very clear. So we\u2019re going to take and give our clients more and better and faster and cheaper all the time, and now we package that with [indiscernible] banking and [indiscernible] card, or discounts on mortgages. That all remains to be seen, but the future is very bright. If we can do more for our customers, that\u2019s a very good thing. Jennifer Piepszak : And don\u2019t forget on credit cards, you get chargeback rights and you get the flows. Jamie Dimon : Right, and you get--you go online, you\u2019re a Chase customer, you get your FICO score for free, you\u2019re going to be able to--we\u2019re going to tell customers [indiscernible] how they can improve their FICO score. You get offers like this Chase [indiscernible] - I mean, we don\u2019t really market it, but it\u2019s really taken off. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so the Chase [indiscernible], we talked about that at investor day. It\u2019s like a really powerful flywheel where we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them, and then we can deliver that value to our customers at zero cost to us. So as I said in the presentation, we\u2019ve had over 60 million Chase offers activated, so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers but our large merchant clients, and at zero cost to us. Betsy Graseck : So that message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the Hill as well. Jamie Dimon : Yes, and we talk to the Hill all the time and a lot of people understand that. Of course, they always want you to do a better job for consumers, which we have been. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I guess the final question here is just on the under-banked. Is there something, or is than an offer than you have for them? Are you considering that, because I\u2019m just thinking about where fintech\u2019s is trying to exploit you, and I know it\u2019s a catchphrase - under-banked, that is being used by [indiscernible], doesn\u2019t necessarily seem like it\u2019s solving anything for them, but maybe you\u2019ve got a better solution that we just don\u2019t focus on. Jamie Dimon : We have [indiscernible]. I think 25% of our branches are [indiscernible] neighbourhoods. We go to those neighborhoods, we do some philanthropy, we\u2019re doing more and more financial education, which I think is really important. I just mentioned the FICO score, but thing is there might be other things we can do. We do Chase Chat, so it\u2019s get people into the branch to educate them about saving, FICO scores, what you can do to get a mortgage to buy a house and stuff like that. Then we have a product, which really is great, called Secure Banking, and think of it as a card but it\u2019s the full thing. You can overdraft, I think it\u2019s $4.95 a month, but you can use ATMs, you can have direct deposit, you can do online mobile payments and stuff like that, so we think that\u2019s a great product for the under-banked. I think that\u2019s going now 25% or--and we\u2019ve kind of pushed that a little bit more, so we\u2019re always trying [indiscernible].  Then we also have special, I call it venture banking, [indiscernible] fund. We\u2019re making loans [indiscernible] non-traditional bank loans that help grow your businesses, so we\u2019re finding a lot of ways to do it and [indiscernible] understand it. I would say we\u2019re at the forefront of that. Fintech, of course is always going to try to eat your lunch, and I think that\u2019s good, that\u2019s called American capitalism, and we have to stay on our toes to compete. But we are. When Jen was at cards, she rolled out last year [indiscernible] Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan, so that people can use their credit balances immediately to do what they want to do and do it well. We rolled out Zelle P2P, that\u2019s good for everybody, so if you have a bank account, you can move money to your friends and relatives without even paying the $10 money changer fees and stuff like that. We\u2019re all-in trying to do a better job for the American consumer, and we think we do a great job for them, and if there are legitimate complaints, we\u2019ll fix it. Jennifer Piepszak : That\u2019s right, and you mentioned the 25% in LMI [indiscernible] in our expansion markets, that\u2019s 30%. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the balance sheet last year, so you\u2019ve seen a huge jump in the trading related assets, and I know you had the accounting change that you mentioned in the supplement. But could you talk about, is that related to market share gains, is it related to just specific strategies with regard to managing liquidity, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be equally growing on the asset side in the trading liability, so just can you explain the dynamics behind that now that adds to the net interest income story? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter over quarter, that was primarily related to our balance sheet intensive businesses in the markets businesses, and then we were down on a spot basis quarter over quarter. But you know, we start with deposit growth and so we have had strong deposit growth, so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well, and you would have seen securities balances up as well, and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short duration securities that are higher yielding than IOER, and--yes. Ken Usdin : Okay, so it is part of the liquidity management strategy? Okay. Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter? Jamie Dimon : [Indiscernible] if you get a higher return in repo than you get in IOER, you\u2019re going to do that. If you get a higher return in standardized--using standardized capital on securities than you are on wholly owned loans, you\u2019re going to do that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in some of these things. Jennifer Piepszak : That\u2019s right, the securities growth, I should have mentioned was [indiscernible] due to the home sales and home lending. Ken Usdin : Right, okay, got it. That makes sense. Did you say what the--can you tell us what the amount of the gains on the loan sales this quarter were, if they were above trend? Jennifer Piepszak : We haven\u2019t disclosed the amounts of the gains, and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter, the first quarter and in the second quarter. The first and second quarter in terms of the notional amount, the first quarter was about $7 billion and the second quarter was about $9 billion, so just a little bit more. Jamie Dimon : The gains in the second quarter net-net were--they show up in different places, but not much, not material. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Ken Usdin : Got it. Lastly, just any thoughts on the investment banking pipeline and the continuation of the outlook across the buckets there? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. In terms of the investment banking pipeline, I\u2019ll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter, and so sequentially you should think about IBCs being down a bit. That said, the pipeline is healthy, although off a record performance last year which is assumption of a reversion to more normal level activity, as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty. In M&A, still feels very healthy and is still a space where companies are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth, especially in North America, perhaps Europe a bit more muted. ECM, we had a very strong second quarter, so that will taper off in the second half a bit, but I would say deals are getting done well in the current environment. Then DCM, DCM will be more subdued, reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities, but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I realize rate expectations can change quickly, but how do you think about managing the company in a rate environment that follows the curve that\u2019s out there for three to four cuts? You said earlier you wouldn\u2019t cut back on technology, but are there other areas in expenses? Do you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet in both directions. It\u2019s a negatively convex balance sheet, and so all else being equal, as rates are declining we would naturally just drift shorter, driven both by assets and by liabilities, so you would expect us to add duration, which we did this quarter. But we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment, we\u2019re going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline, and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration. Then in terms of expenses, again we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment, and I\u2019ll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts, it\u2019s a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about. But as Jamie always says, we\u2019re not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment. That said, in a broader slowdown obviously there are natural levers on volume-related expenses, and we re-decision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis. We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity, depending upon the opportunity, to take a look at that. Jamie Dimon : Remember in a real recession, there are always opportunities for [indiscernible] and vendors fall all over themselves to give you better deals and stuff like that. There are also huge opportunities to spend your money wisely, so the Sapphire card was birthed in \u201909 and you could imagine that--you say okay, we have this great opportunity but we\u2019re not going to take it, and so I think you\u2019ve got to be very careful. The other thing is, marketing money is usually better spent in a downturn, the returns on it usually double. Matt O\u2019Connor: And you talked about the capital and your thought process there. Obviously the authorization of the buyback is a very big number. Is it your expectation that you\u2019ll use it all, or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price, and the environment? Jennifer Piepszak : I would say still to be determined. Our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business, so still to be determined. As you know, it\u2019s over four quarters and so we have time to think about it, but obviously pleased to have the flexibility. Matt O\u2019Connor: Is the timing of that even, or is there flexibility there too? Jamie Dimon : It has been in the past, but we can change that every day. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. A couple of questions. First on the NII outlook beyond this year, I fully appreciate you\u2019re not giving guidance beyond this year, but you do have the guidance from investor day out there of a sustainable NII of $58 billion to $60 billion, that was set in a very, very different rate environment. If we were to see multiple rate cuts, how do we think about that guidance, and what are some of the moving parts that might get you perhaps to the lower end of that $58 billion to $60 billion? Is it simply dependent upon how the economy responds, deposit pricing? If you can just kind of outline what you think some of those moving parts are. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, so the guidance we gave at investor day, steady state 58 to 60, I would say largely still stands, importantly because when we talked about that at investor day, we weren\u2019t assuming any further benefit from rates, so we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset in re-price, and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix. If you remember the slide, there were a number of arrows on the slide even at that time, which was obviously a different rate environment. We were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there, so that obviously continues to be true, so there may be a different path to get there. It may take a little bit longer, but we still believe in that steady state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise. Saul Martinez : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I could change gears a little bit, you recently announced that you\u2019re closing Finn, or you closed Finn, and I think the stated logic is you learned that millennials don\u2019t need a separate brand or experience. But can you just elaborate on the logic there and what you learned from that experience, because it does seem to maybe fly in the face of what some other entities or financial institutions are doing with their digital banking strategy. Jennifer Piepszak : We learned a lot in Finn. You said it, that we learned that importance of the power of the Chase brand certainly means that we don\u2019t need a separate brand. We also learned about a number of features that our customers love, and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the Chase mobile app. I think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this, and not afraid to shut them down when we\u2019ve learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary Chase mobile app. Jamie Dimon : We learned a lot, like how to do digital account openings only digital. When you do it out of a retail bank, you tend to rely on what you already have, so there were a lot of lessons there. We\u2019re always going to be learning from kind of skunkworks and learning from things like that, so we don\u2019t look at those kind of things like failures at all. That is how you learn, and Jeff Bezos will tell you mistakes are good, mistakes are what make you smarter and better, and so I hope we made some really good mistakes that can teach us at all of our businesses at one point. The people doing Finn did a great job, they\u2019re embedded, and by the way, you can open a Chase account now and never go into a branch. You can open an account [indiscernible] it takes minutes to open an account, so we got much better at digital only [indiscernible] separated from the physical branch system. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, and the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity. Jamie Dimon : And we\u2019ll be doing it in small business and merchant processing and all these various things. Saul Martinez : Got it, okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Eric Compton : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. This question kind of ties into some of the items already mentioned - longer term tech focus, and also related to Finn. There has been some press recently about reasons for closing down the Finn app, and one of the items that was mentioned was some of the difficulties banks can potentially run into with their legacy platforms, which for the most part are built on COBOL, which has been around since the sixties and depending on who you talk to, these legacy platforms can either be huge problems for banks or not really a big deal. I guess from the outside, at least for me, it can be kind of hard to tell what really is going on there, so my question is as you compete with fintech firms who are building new platforms from scratch, how do you strategically view dealing with your own legacy platforms? Is there a need to kind of re-do these things eventually in order to actually compete with newer tech over time? Do these legacy platforms really hamstring you in any way, or is the hype around those issues really overdone, and if so, why? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : The hype has been around now for the better part of a decade, right, and we seem to be doing fine. But there is truth--and some of these legacy platforms are also the reason why you have 50 million customers, but it is true that over time, these platforms need to be reformulated and re-factored to be cloud eligible and things like that, and those things are more efficient so your costs will go down, your error rates will go down. The way I\u2019d look at it a little bit is we run 6,000 or 7,000 applications. Over time, those will be marginalized and being re-factored to be cloud eligible [indiscernible] the cloud, very public cloud, and yes, they will be more efficient. But we\u2019ve also had tons of new digital platforms, AIs that are built around these things that do the customer service side [indiscernible] to open accounts in minutes, to get your free credit journey, that we can modify so many things in days and weeks as opposed to years because you\u2019re not monkeying with the whole legacy system, so it\u2019s a little bit of both. But those numbers are embedded in our tech spend - the re-factoring, building data centers, getting better [indiscernible] AI, they\u2019re all in those numbers. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Jamie Dimon : Well, thank you very much. Jen, you did a great job. We\u2019ll talk to you all in a quarter. Jennifer Piepszak : Thanks everyone. Thanks Jamie. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%. Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in Home Lending and Auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Card; number one in global IB fees year-to-date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets. Overall, for the firm, total loans were flat year-on-year, which includes continued mortgage loan sales. SC sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in Card and AUM. Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail. And credit performance remained strong across business. On to Page 2 and some more detail about our third quarter results. Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million. Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.5 billion, reflecting modest net reserve build and charge-offs in line with expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. Now on the balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, up about 10 basis points versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.6 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. Now on to Page 4 for a look at our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking. CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year. Revenue of $14.3 billion was up 7% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels.  Revenue was up 5%, driven by higher NII on deposit growth and margin expansion as well higher noninterest revenue on higher transaction volumes. And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment.  Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales. With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate. And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 10%, and merchant processing volume was up 11%. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. On credit, starting with reserves. This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking. The build in Cards is primarily driven by mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $2.8 billion and an ROE of 13% on revenue of $9.3 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down. It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory. Year-to-date, we continue to rank number one in overall IB wallet and gain share across products and regions, benefiting from our leadership position in technology and health care sectors. In advisory, we were down 13% year-on-year, reflecting lower deal activity compared to a strong prior year. However, we continue to gain wallet share, driven by our strategic investments. In debt underwriting, we were up 17% year-on-year in a market that was down. Here, we benefited from our participation in some large transactions and increased activity in investment-grade bonds.  In equity underwriting, we were up 22% year-on-year, significantly outperforming the market, driven by our strong performance in IPOs and convertibles. And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked number one in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year-on-year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year. However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year. This quarter was characterized by strong client activities across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities. Equity Markets was down 5% against a very strong third quarter last year. Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year. Treasury Services and Securities Services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 7% and 2% year-on-year, respectively. The rate environment remains a relative headwind, primarily from the funding basis compression we've been talking about, which is largely firm-wide neutral, and to a lesser extent, client-specific repricing in Treasury Services. But importantly, the organic growth in fees and balances continues to be strong. Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges. And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $937 million and an ROE of 16%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong investment banking performance. Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market. Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges. Deposit balances were up 3% year-on-year on strong client flows. Loan balances were flat year-on-year across both C&I and CRE.  In C&I, while we are seeing pockets of growth in select industries, like financial institutions, technology and energy, there does continue to be significant runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $668 million with pretax margin of 25% and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisers, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees. Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs as well as reserve builds on loan growth. For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $40 billion, driven by fixed income, and net liquidity inflows of $24 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels. Deposits were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in interest-bearing products. Finally, we had record loan balances, up 7% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $393 million. Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates. This quarter also included small net gains in certain legacy private equity investments compared to approximately $200 million of net losses in the prior year. And expenses of $281 million were up $253 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher investments in technology and a prior year net legal benefit. Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook. Our full year outlook remains in line with previous guidance. We expect net interest income to come in slightly below $57.5 billion, based on the latest implieds; and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65.5 billion. So to wrap up, the U.S. economy is on solid footing. And while global growth is slowing, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Despite continued macro uncertainty and headwinds from the rate environment, this quarter showcases the diversification and scale of our business model. We remain well positioned to outperform in any environment, and we'll continue to strategically invest in our businesses.  And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Curious your take on everything that went on in the repo markets during the quarter, and I would love it if you could put it in the context of maybe the fourth quarter of last year. If I remember correctly, you stepped in, in the fourth quarter. So higher rates, threw money at it, made some more money, and it calmed the markets down. I'm curious what's different this quarter that, that did not happen. And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the market to function better on a go-forward basis. James Dimon : So if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of -- we have a checking account at the Fed with a certain amount of cash in it. Last year, we had more cash than we needed for regulatory requirements. So repo rates went up, we went with the checking account which paid IOER into repo. Obviously makes sense, you make more money. But now the cash in the account, which is still huge. It's $120 billion in the morning, and it goes down to $60 billion during the course of the day and back to $120 billion at the end of the day. That cash, we believe, is required under resolution and recovery and liquidity stress testing. And therefore, we could not redeploy it into repo market, which we would've been happy to do. And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account.  And again, I look at this as technical. A lot of reasons why those balances dropped to where they were. I think a lot of banks are in the same position, by the way. But I think the real issue when you think about it, is does that mean that we have bad markets because that's kind of hitting a red line in that checking account. You're also going to hit a red line in LCR, like HQLA, which cannot be redeployed either. So to me, that will be the issue when the time comes. And it's not about JPMorgan. JPMorgan declined -- in any event, it's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes. Jennifer Piepszak : And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third quarter results. Glenn Schorr : Yes. I feel bad for whoever borrowed at 10%. Okay. Just a quickie on NII. I heard you on the full year '19 commentary -- and I don't think that's surprising, maybe a little bit better. Have you done much repositioning on the balance sheet as we look forward in 2020, which is looking like an obviously lower rate backdrop? I want to ask you what your thoughts around 2020 NII, but I'd rather hear the soft call because I know you're not going to give it to us. Jennifer Piepszak : Well, I'll try. So in terms of balance sheet positioning, as you know, we have a negatively convexed balance sheet. We manage it in both directions. Some moves in interest rates are hedge-able and some are not. In a quarter like we just had, with the rally that we had, you would expect us to buy duration and we did. But in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion. Frankly, that's not a bad place to start. There will be some puts and takes. Obviously, you would have to get the full run rate of the October cut because, of course, they're developing from the implieds, and then there's one more cut next year. But an offset to that, at least a partial offset to that, would be balance sheet growth and mix. So we'll give you more color on Investor Day, as we always do, and we'll be in a better position then. But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, one on your GSIB bucket. I know, as of the end of June, it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year-end. And is there a plan to get back down? And how would you effect that? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So as it relates to GSIB, we fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. As you know, most aspects of GSIB are on a spot basis, so we will manage it like we do any scarce resource and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket for year-end. Betsy Graseck : But is there -- does that impact just your market position in general? Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, et cetera? Or is it really not? Is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you? James Dimon : I couldn't say. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. What we need to do across the various GSIB buckets will not be obvious in our fourth quarter results. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket. It's more than just leverage. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : My first question is a follow-up to Glenn's question. As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan? James Dimon : I said we have $120 billion in our checking accounts with the Fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 during the average day. But we believe the requirement under CLAR and resolution recovery is that when we'd opened that account such that if there's extreme stress, during the course of day, it doesn't go below 0. You go back to before the crisis you go below 0 all the time during the day. So the question is, how far is that as a red line was the intent to regulate to a CLAR resolution to lock up that much of reserves in account of Fed. And that will be up for regulators to decide. But right now, we have to meet those rules. And we don't want to violate anything we told them we're going to do. Erika Najarian : Got it. And as my follow-up, Jen, if -- you said something about the offset to the 2 Fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix. Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and 22% increase in investment securities balances? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. Well, I'll come back to investment securities balances. But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think about largely in deposits. And just as one example, obviously, the rate environment and the economy will matter a whole lot. But just in a declining rate environment, the higher-yielding alternatives for consumers are less attractive. And so we do expect to continue to grow the franchise. And we could see healthy growth in the deposit base. So that's what I was referring to.  In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on. As I said earlier, we did buy duration. But importantly, what you see in investment securities are also cash deployment strategies as well as actions we took on the back of the mortgage loan sales. So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter. James Dimon : In some cases, securities at a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : So you, I guess, lowered your guidance for NII, but also lowered your guidance for expenses. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology? Or just more generally, at every Investor Day, you tell us you're going to spend, what, $12 billion on technology. And we don't really have a lot of insight into the traction that those technology investments are getting. So what's working technology-wise? What's not working? And how much of that can contribute to your improved expense guidance? Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Sure. So I'll start, and if you want to add. So I would say, Mike, the NII guidance is not lower. At the second quarter, we said $57.5 billion, plus or minus. At the time, the implieds said 3 rate cuts : July, September and December. And we said if there were 2 or more, that would be $57.5 billion minus; and if less than that, perhaps $57.5 billion plus. And so we are kind of right where we said we would be. And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balanced growth and 1 less cut in December. So I would say NII guidance broadly in line. On expenses in technology, there's a few things you can think about. First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here. But importantly, you have to look at the underlying story, which I know is what you're getting at, which is there are volume or revenue-related expenses. And we're always looking for productivity there, and -- but they will be what they will be. They will come with top line growth. In terms of investments, we will continue with the discipline we always have around business cases and net present value and payback periods. But we will also always invest in the things we think we need to need to, even if they're a table fix.  And then there's productivity, which is your point. And so we continue to realized productivity in our investments, and we continue to think we have opportunity ahead. We haven't laid that out in terms of quantifying it, but some of the things you can think about are robotics replacing repetitive processes. You can think about machine learning or AI in fraud. So machine learning assisting us in decision-making processes. Our call centers are always getting more productive. As Gordon said at Investor Day, our cost to serve in the consumer businesses are down 15%. And then digital capabilities that we're rolling out to our customers in terms of self-service is not only better for them, but more efficient for us. And so we have realized significant productivity to date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments, and think still have room to run. James Dimon : As you said, in our merchant processing systems, and API store for the CIB. The stuff we built to hooking all that into our custody business. So you can go business-by-business and see the extensive amount of stuff we're rolling out. And it's pretty good. Michael Mayo : All right. Let me have one follow-up then. So I mean how many call center personnel do you have? Or how many data centers do you have? And how does that compare to the peak? James Dimon : We're building many data centers as we speak. I forgot the total number, but it's quite a few. The new ones will be better, more efficient and more expandable and safe and more secure, all that kind of stuff. And we have to build that infrastructure. We have the best in the world. So we're not going to ever scrimp on something like that. And maybe at Investor Day, we can go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people. We think about the productivity of the people. So the number of calls that they are able to take because you may have more people because of more volume, but that's good, healthy volume with top line growth. But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing. James Dimon : Yes. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in cards and consumers come down, not gone up because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers. I would take you through all of them, but then we're telling them bad guys our secrets. But there are a lot of ways to stop some of the bad guys now. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : I'll start off with sort of a broader question on just the macro outlook. I think, Jen, you mentioned you feel the economy -- the U.S. economy is on sound footing, the consumer is obviously strong, but we are seeing some softening in the economic data. What are you hearing from clients? What are they telling you about whether they're concerned or whether there's increasing concern on policy, macro uncertainties? And how you're thinking about that going forward? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty. But broadly speaking, while it's slower growth, it's still growth. As I said, the U.S. consumer is incredibly strong. Consumer spending is strong. Sentiment is strong, so the consumer credit is good. And it is true that if you look at the ISM surveys, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, they were recently disappointing. So I would say, no doubt, cautionary signs, but credit remains very good, and there's still very healthy business activity. Saul Martinez : Okay. Great. That's helpful. On NII, just going back to NII, specifically in the CCB, if you adjust for the $350 million, actually, grew sequentially, which was a pretty strong result. And I know guidance is at the consolidated level. But how do we think about the glide path in that business going forward and some of the puts and takes? Deposit pricing came in a little bit at the consolidated level. I suspect some of that is commercial. But how do we think about that business and the NII trajectory? And is it possible that you can continue to grow that? Jennifer Piepszak : So I mean there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out. We're not immune to that. But as I said earlier, there is at least a partial offset to that in growth. And so we still feel very good about the underlying growth that we're seeing there. And then just in terms of reprice, obviously, there's very little movement on the back of the SEBIs, given there's very little movement on the way up. And in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing. But we love the platform. The branch expansion is going very, very well. And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us some additional color on the Investment Banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter? And then second, if you take a look at the success that you had Investment Banking grabbing more wallet share, is it coming here in North America or in Asia? Can you give us some color there as well? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So on the IB pipeline, I would say it's healthy, although we do expect to be down in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year, on very strong performances in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter of last year. But overall, it feels healthy. And I would say, geographically, largely some strength in the U.S. Gerard Cassidy : And then following up in the Markets business, again, you had good numbers. How important is the technology spending that you've been doing in Markets leading to grabbing more wallet share in both equity and FICC? James Dimon : I think it's critical. If you walk on the trading floor today, the deployment of technology in automated trading algorithms in swaps and FX and equities, it's making its way into corporate buying. But I think it's critical you keep up with the technology in a very competitive business where market share matters. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Compton of MorningStar. Eric Compton : So I just want to step back and real big picture here. I mean net interest income, you're already starting to see some pressure there. Just I think the general commentary in the industry is the banks are just under pressure seemingly almost everywhere. You got to focus on expenses. And yet, you guys are still hitting returns on tangible at 18%.  So just stepping back, I mean, you still have a couple of billion to play with before you even start getting to that 17% long-term goal level. Like what worries you about potentially pushing you under that 17% level? It just seems like even with all the pressures in the industry, you're still even exceeding it. Other than onetime credit events really -- I guess stepping back, what worries you about pushing the bank to that or even below that from your perspective? James Dimon : And again, I think that you're overdoing the pressures on the banking industry. Okay. Because we've had growth in the United States for the better part of 10 years. And I'd say that the credit is extraordinarily good. So if you look at consumer credit, commercial credit, wholesale, it's extraordinarily good. It can only get worse if you have a cycle. So our 17% is -- we always sort of play just through the cycle. We are at the over-earning part of the cycle in credit today. At one point, we'll be at the under-earning part on credit. And of course, if you have a recession, it affects volumes and all these sort of things. So that's right -- that 17% is through the cycle and, frankly, not that bad. Operator : Our next question is from Marlin Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marlin Mosby : I wanted to ask you two kind of different venues of questions. First, is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter. Just wondered how much you had in premium amortization that was embedded in that. And then as you look at the interest-bearing deposit cost, we didn't get much traction on the first cut. But did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the -- going into the fourth quarter? Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Sure. So first, on securities yield. So that did play a role, Marty. But more importantly, the impact on securities yields came from mix and just lower rates overall. So predominantly, mix and lower rates, and then to a lesser extent, your point on prepaid as well as a little bit of day counts. And then on betas, broadly speaking, we'd say betas are symmetric. And so if you look at the retail side, as I said before, very little movement on SEBI. And we did see rates paid even tick up a little bit there quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, there's obviously more opportunity to reprice, but we do that client by client. And we're not going to lose valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And so what we saw there, as you might expect, in CIB, rates paid down quarter-over-quarter. And then we also saw rates pay down in both AWM and the Commercial Bank, but a little bit less so. Marlin Mosby : And then would you see retail improving next quarter? And then Jamie, I wanted to talk to you about liquidity. Two things. One, we saw the repo market. And as you looked at Volcker and the liquidity coverage ratios, you've kind of taken the big banks out of participating and being able to solve for some of those liquidity issues. So the Fed has kind of put a ring-fence around this, putting that all on their shoulders versus letting JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs or Bank of America jump in and help in those processes. And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans, and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that? James Dimon : So the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk -- I mean the advance is far more important, and we should probably report more than that because that's 13%. But when we're constrained by standardized, there are points in time when putting mortgage on your balance sheet just gives you a very low return. And of course, you have a portfolio decision. You can sell it or put it in your balance sheet. If you sell it, you're going to probably reinvest in securities. So it's a pure economic calculation of what gives you a better return. And that's why, I think we need some fixes in the mortgage market about securitizations. Because I think we've pointed out, if you had built the securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market, you keep some on them on your balance sheet. You sell some of the risk. And you wouldn't have to sell these mortgages per se.  And I do think -- and the liquidity, we've focused on liquidity at the Fed account. We have 400 -- probably total $450 billion of cash, T-bills, repo, deposit at the Fed, and there's all -- a bunch of certain constraints. And you want to base a proper liquidity. But then I should also point out that those things go into getting multiple GSIB calculations, multiple other calculations. So you kind of calibrate, of course, all those things and optimize across all those things. But I do think you're correct. The banks are deploying now but they will not be able to redeploy a big chunk of that $500 billion that we have in all the markets when the time comes. It's not Volcker per se. Volcker is a slightly different thing. Jennifer Piepszak : And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter. We do think we'll continue to see deposit margin compression there on the retail side. We have come off the peaks in terms of CD pricing, but you still have slight migration there into interest-bearing products. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Jen, you had mentioned earlier just the point about that next year's earning asset growth will be led largely through deposits. But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the Wealth Management complex? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. Look, I think it's difficult to know. I think, in a declining rate environment, as I said, I think the higher-yielding alternatives are obviously less attractive for consumers. We do still see good organic growth in wholesale as well in both Treasury Services and Securities Services. So I think it's difficult to know. The macro environment will be a big determinant. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Understood. And the second question, the card revenue margin you mentioned, it's kind of flattened out. And I'm just wondering, can you first walk us through the NII versus fee components there? Any -- is it partially because of that obvious NII challenge? Is there also any changes with regards to just the underlying card fee activity? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. There is really just timing. There's just seasonality there. So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11 50%, plus or minus. But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11 50%, plus or minus, for the full year guidance, so just seasonality. James Dimon : And the thing I'd add here, it doesn't have the same compression that it does in deposits. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Very different dynamic there. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Just I just want to follow up on -- you talked about the fourth quarter net interest come just under $14 billion, and that's not a bad place to start for next year. You highlighted balance sheet growth and mix and had some puts and takes. But it's probably not as bad as I think some would have thought. Think about that $14 billion-ish as potential run rate plus or minus. I'm just to trying to better understand like what's the rate assumption that you have. And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that? Jennifer Piepszak : So I mean we're doing that based on the latest implieds. And it's obviously early days. We're working through our budget process as we speak. So it's based on the latest implieds, which have a cut in October and a cut in April. And 10-year, call it, 1.70% plus or minus. So relative to where we might have been just a couple of months ago, or even weeks ago, it might have been a different outlook. So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know. James Dimon : And it's assuming some balance sheet growth, as opposed to all things being equal. That would be worse. Jennifer Piepszak : That's right. It would be worse. The balance sheet growth, that will partial offset to larger impacts from just rates. Matthew O'Connor: And what is the rate sensitivity at this point? And how is that split between the short and long end? Jennifer Piepszak : There, I would just say you can look at the earnings at risk that we'll have in the Q. I mean that's probably the best way to think about it. Because that is not an NII sensitivity, but is an interest rate sensitivity. And so that will be out in a few weeks. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : But Jamie, this is the first earnings call we\u2019ve had since the Business Roundtable came up with a new statement that it's not about shareholder-driven capitalism, it's about stakeholder-driven capitalism. And I was hanging out at the New Yorker Festival over the weekend and your name came up, and at least one author said he spoke to you. And the real question, what is the political and regulatory risk to JPMorgan to earnings as we look out over a year? You're having the presidential debates. Over the weekend, people talked about -- and the politicians talked about the wealth tax, the transaction tax, the change in corporate tax, personal tax, basically flattening the pyramid. And it seems like a lot of people point their fingers at the banks, including JPMorgan. So my question to you is what are you doing... James Dimon : They're pointing their fingers as base on what? Point their fingers as a base for what? Michael Mayo : I think part of the cause, part of the cause of inequality in America. Banks should be doing more to help out the situation. And again, it's a whole -- this is just one example, Mike. The way I saw this at the New Yorker Festival, this was kind of intellectual underpinnings of a lot of the policies that are being introduced today. And so you're seeing that in the politicians' statements about wealth tax, changes to the bank business model, too much deregulation. And it's just an environment -- I mean here we are 10 years after the financial crisis, where I would summarize it as very anti-bank. And I know JPMorgan had proposals to help move the company and the country ahead. But how do you, as head of the Business Roundtable, help the industry and corporate America manage these concerns about income inequalities and these other topics that come up in the presidential debates. I know it's a big question. But hey, you're in that role as -- with the Business Roundtable. James Dimon : Okay. So the Business Roundtable, checking -- get rid of shareholder value, basically said shareholder value and customers and employees and communities, which essentially has been how many of these banks been running for years. I think part of the statement was a lot of the world looked at shareholder value and it -- that you have rapacious profit seeking. Whereas most CEOs are thinking pretty long term, building people, taking care of their employees, their customers. And we can highlight all the great things we do for employees : huge training, health, wellness, retirement, sharing the wealth inside the company. And we do, do all that. And most of these companies do that. A lot of these larger companies, they're great community citizens when it comes to trying to participate and help and stuff like that. So I do think -- and so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is.  That environment changes. Politically, it changes. Economically it changes, geopolitically. But we're just going to navigate to do the best we can, serving our clients the best we can. And I do think that we try -- and I'm speaking for a lot of -- to try to do a tremendous amount to help the communities because there have been people left behind. The inner city schools are not failing because of banks, okay? And infrastructure is not failing because of banks. So I think we can help build infrastructure, help train people, get more skills, get involved with education systems and like all the kind of stuff that a lot of us all do in Detroit, we could lift up society. And I think it's good for us to lift up society. And when society does better, everyone does better.  If you don't believe me, look at Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, North Korea, et cetera, that doing well is a good thing for society, and we can share the wealth a little bit. So I'm not going to respond to specific political statements out there, but we'll do our part to be a great community citizen and serve our shareholders at the same time. Michael Mayo : So can I put words in your mouth? I mean doing well for communities and employees and all the other stakeholders is good for the shareholders long term. Is that... James Dimon : Yes. And Mike, I actually gave examples in the crisis about the amount of people that we financed at markets way -- prices way below the market. We're doing that to make rapacious profit seeking? No. And that included states, cities, hospitals, businesses, consumers et cetera. And so you won't be \u2013 but our attitude was not going to help our clients get through this tough time. It wasn't about our profitability. Our profitability dropped dramatically, and we were fine. And I think that was a long-term thinking, but you can never get sued over that. So -- and same time we do with employees. We're constantly investing in employees and branches, in jobs and training. That stuff will benefit 3 years out, 5 years out, 10 years out, 20 years out. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Quick question on equity trading. I know you gave an update on where you thought the revenues would come in, in mid-September. Looks like it came in worse than what you were looking for. Is there a way to kind of break out what was the impact of the potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. In equity derivatives, it was a combination of weaker client activity and some losses on inventory, but it wasn't meaningful. Those losses were certainly not meaningful in the grand scheme of things, but they were part of the equity derivatives story. Brian Kleinhanzl : But there wasn't any other additional investments in there that had marks on them impacting the numbers? Jennifer Piepszak : No. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then separately on CECL. I know you've been doing parallel runs, as all banks have been. Are you at the point now where you can kind of give what the pro forma provision will be for CECL? Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date? Jennifer Piepszak : Well, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion. We've done a ton of work, as you say, and a lot of modeling. The range is still between $4 billion and $6 billion. And we'll be able to be more precise, obviously, as we prepare for the January 1 implementation. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : One follow-up on the equity. I mean I know DB books were in the market, and I believe that you were a winner of some of that. Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q? James Dimon : There was some fine balance I think you're referring to. I don't know the answer to that. Jennifer Piepszak : It was not meaningful whatever it is. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. And then separately, there's been some news obviously on discount brokers cutting commissions to 0. I know you have You Invest and that that's a recent launch. But how do you think about how that impacts your business model? Is that just something that you would consider is specific to You Invest? Or do you think that that's something that would have a bigger impact and potentially more optionality for your clients across your wealth spectrum? Jennifer Piepszak : So majority of our customers in You Invest already trade for free, and so we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. As we think about You Invest, it is one component of our broader investment strategy. And as I said, we're really proud of this quarter's results with client investment assets being up 13%. It was an important product launch for us in terms of meeting an unmet need with our existing customers, but we're pleased to see the market moving toward us. James Dimon : Yes. And there's strength in You Invest. We still are improving the products over time. We haven't done a tremendous amount of marketing. Kind of want to get it all right both You Invest and You Invest Portfolios, and then we'll figure out all the exact specific pricing around it. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you. James Dimon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which, as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.5 billion; EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $29.2 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Underlying performance continues to be strong. Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale with average balance up 7% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the company were at 3% year-on-year excluding the impact of home lending loan sales in prior quarters. Client investment assets and consumer business banking were up 27% and asset and wealth management AUM was up 19% reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year, as well as organic growth. We've ranked number one for the full year in Global IB fees with 9% wallet share. And growth IB revenue in the commercial bank was a record $2.7 billion. In CIB Market, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year, however, it's important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms. In fact, a record fourth quarter. And credit performance continues to be strong across the company. On to Page 2 and some more detail about our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. Noninterest revenue was up $2.6 billion or 21% on higher revenue in CIB markets and AWM and continued strong performance in home lending and auto. Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 4% on volume and revenue related costs. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million, or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations. Turning to the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $36.4 billion; EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion all records. And delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Revenue was up $7.2 billion, or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.  Noninterest revenue was at $5.1 billion, or 9% driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB markets revenues. And expenses of $55.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year. And on credit, performance remains strong throughout 2019. Credit costs were $5.6 billion. In consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increasing card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit cost and home lending. And in wholesale, we were at $504 million largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018.  Moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter. The firm distributed $9.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter including $6.7 billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of $0.90 per share. And while on the topic of capital, it's worth noting given the actions we have taken; we fully expect it will remain in a 3.5% G-SIB buckets. Before we move into the business results, I'll spend a moment talking about CECL on Page 5. As you know, the transition to CECL was effective on January 1st and therefore there's no impact to our 2019 financials. On the page is the CECL adoption impact, an overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion which is at the lower end of the range we've provided. This was driven by an increase in consumer of $5.7 billion mostly coming from card, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale of $1.4 billion. In Card, the increase is a result of moving to less time lost coverage versus a shorter lost emergence period under the incurred model whereas in wholesale modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecast versus through the cycle loss rates under incurred result in a decrease especially given the forecast to credit environments. Recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a $2.7 billion after-tax decrease retained earnings as you can see on the page. Also important to note, we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital. And now turning to businesses, we'll start with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%. Client investment assets at 27% and total loans down 6%. For the full year, results in CCB were strong was $16.6 billion of net income, up 12% and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $65.9 billion, up 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year. In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was down 2% driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as accountant and transaction growth. Home Lending revenue was down 5% driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue reflecting a 94% increase in origination.  And in Card, Merchant Services and Auto, revenue was up 9% driven by higher card NII on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes. Card loan growth was 8% and sales up 10% reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season.  Expenses of $7.2 billion or up went by 2% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business including market expansion largely offset by expense efficiencies. On credit, this quarter CCB had a net reserve release of $150 million. This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million reflecting improvements in delinquency and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by Card and consistent with expectations. Now turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on Page 7. For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net incomes of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year. For the full year, CIB delivered record revenue of $38 million and an ROI of 14%. In Investment Banking, IB fees reached an all-time record for the full year. It maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was up 6% year-on-year outperforming the market which was flat. Advisory fees were down 3% following a record performance last year. On a sequential quarter basis, fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions and for the year we ranked number two in gain share. Debt underwriting fees were up 11% year-on-year due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerated their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets. And for the year, we maintained our number one rank overall and we were number one for reinvest positions in both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans. Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year reflecting strong performance in the US and Latin America. The new issuance market continued to be active and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $5 billion, up 66% year-on-year driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both fixed income and equity markets. Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.  Equity markets were up 16% driven by strength across cash and primes. Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth. While security services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 3%. Expenses at $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investments. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROI of 16% for the fourth quarter. And for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investment. Gross investment banking revenues was $634 million, up 5% year-over-year driven by increased large deal activity. Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking. Expenses of $882 million were up 4% year-on-year driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology. Deposit balances were up 8% year-on-year as we continue to see strong client growth. Loan balances were up 1% year-on-year. C&I loans were up 2% driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets, partially offset by the runoff in our tax exempt portfolio. The CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher origination in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters. Underlying credit performance continues to be strong. Now on Asset and Wealth Management on page 9. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $785 million with pretax margin of 28% and ROE of 29% for the fourth quarter. And for the year AWM generated net income of $2.8 billion with both pretax margin and ROE of 26%. Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuation and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses was $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year and for the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $14 billion driven by fixed income and multi assets and we had net liquidity inflows of $37billion. AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products. Deposits were up 8% year-on-year driven by growth and interest bearing products. And finally, we had record loan balances of 8% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $361 million. Revenue was the loss of $228 million for the current quarter driven by approximately $190 million of net markdown on certain legacy private equity investments. Sequentially revenues down $920 million due to lower rates. The benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales as well as the PE losses I just mentioned. Year-on-year revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates. Expenses of $343 million were down $165 million year-over-year due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year. And turning to Page 11 for the outlook. At Investor Day, as always we will give you more information on the full-year outlook. However for now, I'll provide some color and reminders about the first quarter. We expect NII to be approximately $14 billion market dependent; adjusted expenses to be about $17 billion and as a reminder the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments and as a result is currently estimated to be approximately 17% just to manage tax rate about 500 to 700 basis points higher. So to wrap up, 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenues, net income and EPS. Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive underpinned by the strength of the US consumer and despite expected slower global growth in the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well-positioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business models. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from is Kenn Usdin of Jefferies. KennethUsdin: Thanks, good morning. Hi, Jen, how are you? Jen, I was wondering on terms of the NII outlook you talked about the $14 billion level. Obviously getting to a point of stability. Can you help us outside of day count, can you help us understand just where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet? What happens if rates generally stay flat from here just in terms of the rate side of the equation if we hold volume aside? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. As we look at rates paid on the retail side, we didn't obviously have reprice on the way up. And so there's little to do on the way down. In fact, there from a rate paid perspective we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates pay pick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect and we could see betas accelerate after the second cut. So there we saw more of a decline in CIB than we did in CB or AWM as you might expect. Importantly though as we only spend on the wholesale side, we price the client by client and so we're not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta. And then I would just say in terms of the outlook with the Fed on hold, the implies do still have one cut later in 2020 and based on the latest implies we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020 flat to slightly down as a headwind from rates will be offset with balance growth. KennethUsdin: Yes, got it. And just on --one question on just the volume side of things. Ex the mortgage loans sales last year you're still on that like 3% core growth. And obviously talked a lot about thus the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level. Just what's the status of just corporate and commercial customers now that we're closer to phase one getting finalized. UMSCA's on the table, just-- what's the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So the fourth quarter definitely I would say stabilized things, trade certainly stabilized things broadly speaking, stopped getting worse. And so we saw sentiment improved a bit which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter and then certainly there are some puts and takes. I mean that US consumer remains in a very strong shape both from a credit perspective sentiment spending. Obviously, labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was six months ago. So we have a broadly speaking constructed out located in as we're heading into 2020 year. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. SaulMartinez: Hi, good morning. I have a question on credit and CECL. And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome or economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and but CECL does materially change the way in which time -- changed the timing in which earnings accrete to book value in capital obviously with a higher upfront hit. But you guys have also been shifting your loan book pretty materially towards cards with which has much higher loss content than your total book. So I guess twofold question. One is how do we think about provisioning in this context? Should we think provisioning is going to be well above charge-offs as your reserve ratio moves up, because I would think your ALLL ratio post CECL adoption which is I think is about 1.8%, 1.9%. It should move up as card which has a much higher loss content than that continue to grow in the mix. So just how we think about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and CECL's adoption. And then I guess, secondly, if there is a change in the macro environment and in the credit environment does get worse and CECL that inflection goes through your reserves and your provisioning. Is there a point where CECL actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So I'll start with the provisioning. So, look, I think it's fair to say under CECL you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macro economic forecasts. But there that would depend of course on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extent of those downturns. In cards specifically as you say, in any one period of growth or downturns you could see an increase in reserve and expense that we're taking, life of loan first is the next 9 or 12 months. So that's true and then on the wholesale side you could see some differences of course because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through the cycle. Having said that, we continue to believe that incremental volatility would be material for us and of course net charge-offs is not changing. And then from a price perspective, we don't foresee in the near term any pricing changes. The cash flows with the customer have not changed. And so we don't see any but it is true as you rightly point out that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that we're taking reserves up front versus through time. So over time you could see that but we're not expecting it in the near term. SaulMartinez: Got it. I guess on the provisioning side my question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more towards higher loss content lending which obviously have higher margins and higher profitability through the course --over the course of the loan in theory but like in that context I would --is it fair to say you're provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up is that mix changes on your balance sheet. JenniferPiepszak: It could be, it could be. So that's just timing particularly on the card side. It's just timing but it's difficult to know again because it relies on our ability that has perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. ErikaNajarian: Hi, good morning. So I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results. Understand that obviously the fourth quarter 2018 comp was light but $3.4 billion is so you know a pretty heavy number for a fourth quarter for JPMorgan. So and any color you could provide would be very helpful, Jennifer. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So you are talking about market, Erika? Yes, okay, sure. So they're --at Goldman in early December, I did say we expected to be up meaningfully. I'm saying the performance was broad-based in rates we call out securitized products. I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products and rate which were bright spots but broadly speaking obviously equities got a very strong quarter as well. So it's really across the franchise and we saw very strong client flow and we had success monetizing those flows. So just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance. ErikaNajarian: Got it. My follow-up question is that a quarter ago and two quarters ago the revenue backdrop for banks in general when the outlook was starting to deteriorate. And I think management had gave us in color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment. But you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing. That being said, your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside. So if you think about 2020 is the best way to think about expenses just at 55% overhead ratio. JenniferPiepszak: So, look, on the efficiency ratio, yes, I would say that like we've run the company with great discipline whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle but because the efficiency ratio is an outcome not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year. We think about operating leverage over time and we always say we're not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds. And expenses, I would just say that at Investor Day last year Marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post 2019 in 2019 adjusted expenses were up 3%, 2020, we expect them to be up less than that. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. MichaelMayo: Hi. Is Jamie on the call? I'm sorry. JenniferPiepszak: Yes. He is. MichaelMayo: Okay. So just a question for Jamie because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity. And I know this is a very simple question, but can you talk about the connection between easing trade issues and better trading. And you said that was better toward the end of the year. Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter? JamesDimon: That's a really hard question to answer, Mike. But obviously trade born a lot of consternation that has eased off a little bit. I don't think it's going to completely go away. You still have actual ongoing trade issues of China and Europe and stuff like that. I think because that sentiment got better trading got better so they're going- how long that continues we don't know. MichaelMayo: And then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3% it should be less than that this year. You guys had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off. So as those levels off maybe you see paybacks from prior investment. Any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior year and how you think about that? And I know we'll get more at Investor Day. JenniferPiepszak: Sure, of course. So I think you can think about tech spending on a fully-loaded basis being in line with what I described for the company. And we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech but as you well know it's we continuously invest in tech and so there's a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off. And we're investing in new technology and innovation. So you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how I describe the company in terms of trends. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: Hi, good morning. Two questions, one on asset growth in the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the G-SIB target. And then in addition this year I think you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors or at least the investors are taking the risk of it. And then you're requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while you're keeping the customer relationship. When I see these things I'm wondering how you're thinking about how much room you have for asset growth as we go into 2020 and is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage loan trade to free up space for growth. Maybe could speak to that? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So I mean we're bound by standardized capital and so of course that is a consideration for us. And one of the reasons that we're looking to structured loan sales as you describe in the mortgage business. So we think that there's more we can do there. And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the Fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult. So both are at the margins constraints for us but broadly speaking I wouldn't say that that we are constrained given where we are on our capital ratios. BetsyGraseck: And as I think about CECL, appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call. I'm just wondering a couple of things. One why do you think you ended up towards the low end of your $4 billion to $6 billion increase in reserves that you outlined earlier? And what kind of estimates you have for the economic outlook? You've got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period et cetera and so I'm just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model so that I understand what's embedded in your scenario and in your ALLR ratio. JamesDimon: Sure. So we, I think we ended up at the low end as we through the year continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like. And so I think that's really what's driving it obviously portfolio mix as well continue to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio. And then on the estimates for the economic outlook, as you rightly say there is the reasonable and supportable period which for us is two years and so we do use multiple weighted scenarios there. So we weight multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight and that's where you end up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range. JamesDimon: Jen, are we going to disclose some of those variables over time? JenniferPiepszak: That's a great point, Jamie. I should say that, yes. We, I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q. JamesDimon: Which means all the banks are bestowing these ridiculous forecasts and going forward and differences? We'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business, but we will disclose we need to know to make it clear what we're doing and why we're doing it. JenniferPiepszak: That's right. So you'll see more in the Q's. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. MatthewO'Connor: Good morning. Two quick follow-ups to some things that have been talked about. I guess first on expenses, full-year outlook was pretty clear less than 3% growth, but the first quarter seems a little bit higher than the maybe I would have thought up 4% year-over-year. And I don't know if that's just rounding and I'm getting too obsessed over $100 million here there or if you're up funding some investment spend, and if so, what that's for? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So the first quarter tends to be a bit higher for us if you look through history. And so but there you can think about it comparing it year-over-year. We have volume and revenue related expenses increasing a bit of an increase on investments, but both are being partially offset by expense efficiency. MatthewO'Connor: Okay. And the other follow up question is just on capital allocation, obviously, it's a good problem to have but the ratios keep going up, the capital generation keeps going up; the stock keeps going up. You're obviously buying back a lot of stock. The goal is to get the dividend, I think, higher over time but let me just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels. If there's other call it creative uses of capital like I always think about all the money you spend with technology. And does it make sense to buy technology versus do it organic? So just maybe address some of those things. Thank you. JenniferPiepszak: Sure, so on the ratio, I'll just remind you that of course we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year. And so since our last CCAR filing, we have realized some RWA efficiency and we've out earns relative to the assumptions in the CCAR filing. And so that's part of the reason why we've seen the ratios float up there. On stock buybacks, as you rightly point out our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth. And so we are always looking to do that first and foremost and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to distribute excess capital to shareholders through buyback. And we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above 2x tangible book which is about where we are now. We will obviously --when distributing excess capital always be looking at the alternatives but at 17% ROTCE and 2% or 3% dividend payout ratio there's a high bar for the alternatives. JamesDimon: You are absolutely right about acquisitions. We did do InstaMed this year which hooks up is electronic, system that hooks up providers and consumers of healthcare. Well, I think the numbers are 80% and 90% is still done by check. So there are opportunities like that we absolutely would be on the hunt for them. JenniferPiepszak: That's right. We did last year, yes. JamesDimon: And we did a year before. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. GerardCassidy: Hi, Jennifer. Question on credit. You obviously put up some real good numbers once again on credit quality. And I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us any color on what brought that down and could you tie in also any concerns that you may have about the energy portfolio? I know it's not material but there are some concerns out there about energy credits. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So on wholesale non-performing loans in the CIB that was some name specific upgrades that we had in the CIB. And then in the commercial bank that was related to charge-offs taken in the quarter. And then on energy, really nothing there thematically I would say like any sector. We have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception. But I wouldn't say anything thematically in our portfolio that we're concerned about. GerardCassidy: Very good. And then I don't know if I heard you correctly in the last answer to the stock repurchase program. I understand of course it's driven by your CCAR results, but if the price of the stock and it's a good problem to have gets to a level that you consider to be too high. I think you may have said 2x tangible book value. What then happens if the price of it gets to a point where you guys think it's just too high to buy it back? What do you do with the excess capital at that point. Have you --given that much and again it's a good problem to have I understand that but if you give it any thought to that. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. We give a lot of thought to it and I agree it is a high-class problem. And so we said that at or above 2x tangible book make sense. If it continues to go up we're going to continue to look at alternatives. Most importantly within the company in terms of how we should really think about the return on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth. Jamie, I don't know, if there's anything you want to add? Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. StevenChubak: Hi, good morning. So, Jennifer, I wanted to start with a question on capital. Quarles indicated in a recent interview that he plans to implement the bulk of the SCB in 2020 CCAR. Also alluded to the possibility of deploying a counter-cyclical buffer as part of that. I'm just wondering if the countercyclical buffer is actually deployed or incorporated within the test. Is that something that's underwritten as part of your 12% CT1 target and are you anticipating changes to the G-SIB coefficient calculations that you allude to earlier in the call as part of the coming cycle as well? JenniferPiepszak: Thanks Steven. So I mean you touched on a number of things that are all important. And I think what's most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them. The comments from the Vice Chair has been constructive in the sense that he always reiterates that he thinks that level of capital in the system is about right. And so we'll have a firmer view when we see a final rule. As you say, we do expect to see something in 2020 based upon the comments that we have heard just like you have. And we expect that our 12% target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the Vice Chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right. And then but we can't have a firm view until we see the final rule. And then on G-SIB, we remain hopeful that we're going to see the refinement that the Fed has been talking about perhaps not full recalibration until Basel IV which is what the Vice Chair recently said, but certainly there are a number of refinements that we've been talking about and the Fed has been talking about for years and that we remain hopeful that we'll see them very soon. StevenChubak: Thanks for that color, Jennifer. And just one final one for me. We saw really strong FIC results as well as really strong institutional deposit growth. And I was hoping you could speak to what impact the Fed balance sheet growth is actually having on all of your different businesses or how that's manifesting? Because it seems to be providing a pretty nice tailwind, whether it's some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that you're seeing across the overall franchise, but institutional in particular. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So you are absolutely right. On the wholesale side, the Fed balance sheet extension was a for sure a tailwind for us. Although, I would say the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth and client acquisition. [Tech Difficulty] pension was the tailwind and elsewhere I would say obviously it was the right thing to do. And provided stability in the repo markets throughout the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. BrianKleinhanzl: Good morning. A quick question on the deposit cost. Could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers were, that saw -- you saw have the big reduction in deposit costs, linked quarter. Was that in security services or was a wealth management? JenniferPiepszak: Sure, Brian. So on that -- I'll start with retail where we saw raise pay pick up a bit and that's on migration from savings to CDs. We have seen CD pricing come off its peak, but continued migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, you see bigger declines in rates paid in treasury services for sure. And then a little bit less so in the commercial bank and AWM. And again as we always say these are named specific client by client decisions. And while we feel good about where we are, these are decisions we make client by client and we're certainly careful and have a lot of discipline not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta. BrianKleinhanzl: And then a separate question. In the commercial bank, I mean you seen loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year. I mean what's the sentiment now in the middle market and the corporate client? Is it a sentiment issue? Is it just timing issue? Therefore seeing better loan growth. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through but broadly speaking I would say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand and in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused and specialized industries and market expansion, but of course that offsets partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off and then in CRE good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there given the rate environment. And then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined given where we are in the cycle. JamesDimon: I would just add as capital expenditures come down all things being equal which they're not, but all things being equal you see a reduction in some lending. These companies need less money to pay off receivables and inventory and planting equipment. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. GlennSchorr: Hello there. Hi. A quick question on open APIs and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of the banking industry, meaning there's this concerns over data security and things like that but JPMorgan has some plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers. I'm just curious to get your big-picture thoughts on what level concerns we had? What are the good and the bad? JenniferPiepszak: Yes. I mean there I would say, Glenn, our customer's data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. And we think over time the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have third-party apps only access data through our APIs. And so we are working name by name to get those agreements in place. And we hope through time that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customer's data. We think that's the most secure way to do it. JamesDimon: But very importantly is that that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them, does not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off, as opposed to today if you gave your bank pass code to someone they're taking the data every day maybe even every minute. And you don't even know that if you forgot. JamesDimon: Great point and we're going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that. GlennSchorr: So you will -- you will give them the tools to control that. JenniferPiepszak: Yes. You can imagine the dashboard where they will have -- JamesDimon: That is the full sense. JenniferPiepszak: Yes. GlennSchorr: And then just curious if you've seen any follow-on impacts that you've seen some repricing on parts of the illiquid markets, and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies. And is that just the repricing and everybody that owns them will take some hits a little bit slower progress on banking front and that's it, or is there anything bigger there to worry about with what's going on in the illiquid side? JamesDimon: Each of the target companies? GlennSchorr: Yes. I am sorry. JamesDimon: Yes. Look, there are lot of private companies they -- a lot of do well, some don't, some of fail, some have access to capital now, they won't have access to capital in a downturn, but it's not a systemic issue. It's just the other capital market there are a lot of private companies. And so I don't think it's that big a deal, you just have an adjustment and access to capital that will happen periodically. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. MarlinMosby: Thank you. Jennifer you were kind of foreshadowing lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter and then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected. Is there anything that's permanent here? Are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these two quarters? JenniferPiepszak: Yes. They're -- I wouldn't say there's anything permanent there. The first quarter is typically lower for us, Marty. You can think about full year 2020 as being 20% plus or minus and of course that would depend on any non-recurring items we might have or any change in regulation but about 20% plus or minus and then of course the managed tax rate is typically 500 to 700 basis points higher than that. MarlinMosby: And then a bigger question when we came into 2018 the net interest margin was around 2.5% and then now as we're coming out of 2019, the net interest margin has fallen below 2.4%. So interest rates went up 100 basis points and then down 75 and we've netted down in negative 10 basis points. So I was just curious in that path it's either the way the Fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure in the net between deposit pricing and loan pricing. Or do we think that this is probably just some of the competition that came in after the tax reform and maybe this is just the evidence of some of that competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes? JenniferPiepszak: Yes. So there I would say, Marty, on that sort of the last several hikes there was some catch up there because we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment. So if you just looking at the last few hikes the betas would certainly be higher than what we're seeing in terms of the first 3 eases here, but broadly speaking on NIM, I mean we don't -- NIM is an outcome for us not an input and as we think about looking forward certainly the environment is very competitive, it always has been and NII the outlook for 2020 is at this point based upon the implies flat to slightly down. And we do expect balance sheet growth. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale. AndrewLim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could give a bit more color on your market's performance there? Obviously it's done very well geographically is there much more weighting there on the US versus Europe and APAC? JenniferPiepszak: I would say, Andrew that it was broad based. We can have Jason and team follow up specifically on a geographic breakdown, but it was largely broad-based. AndrewLim: Right and would you say with confidence that you're gaining market share in both territories there? JenniferPiepszak: Again, I don't have the split on market share by region but Jason and team can certainly follow up on that. JamesDimon: Yes. I'm not sure, we want to start disclosing that regularly. I do believe that market share went up in pretty much in most markets, but you can't say most markets and all products. Operator : And our next question is from Alison Williams of Bloomberg Intelligence. AlisonWilliams: Good morning. So I had a similar question just circling back to trading and the CIB more broadly. So obviously the bank has gained share but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general. You're a leader in the US anecdotally. We hear US banks have been making gains in Europe. Can you speak at all to that opportunity? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So as you said we'll give you more color at Investor Day for the Treasury services business, we feel really good about where we're positions. I think going forward they'll obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth, but given the investments that we have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier. We feel really good about the capabilities that we're adding and what we're seeing in terms of organic growth there. But we can talk to you more about that at Investor Day. End of Q& A Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Thanks everyone. James Dimon : Thank you. Hope to see you guys tomorrow. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call. And I know I speak for the entire Company when I say, we\u2019re just thrilled that he is back. Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front lines of this crisis. The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment. And as always, it\u2019s available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on page 1, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the ways we\u2019re responding to COVID-19. As a firm, we are focused on being there for our employees, customers, clients, and communities in what is an unprecedented and uncertain environment. And while we don\u2019t know how this will play out, we will be transparent here about our assumptions and what we know today. Our number one priority is to continue to provide our services in an uninterrupted way, while also providing a safe work environment for our employees. We\u2019re incredibly proud of all that our firm has been able to do over the past few weeks. So, I\u2019ll just hit on a few examples here. We\u2019ve mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively. Currently, we have about 70% working from home across the Company and for many groups that number is well north of 90%. And for those who still need to go into the office or into a branch, we are taking extra precautions and being extremely mindful of their safety. And we\u2019re providing assistance in other ways too. For instance, we\u2019re offering free COVID-related medical treatment to U.S. employees and their dependents. On the consumer side, approximately three quarters of our 5,000 branches have been open all with heightened safety procedures and many with drive-thru options. And the vast majority of our over 16,000 ATMs remain accessible. And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance, and we\u2019ve put in place new digital and self service solutions in record time. And while wait times have been extended, we\u2019re making good progress reducing them. For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, we\u2019re providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees. We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment. And in the month of March, we extended more than $100 billion of new credit. In wholesale, clients drew more than $50 billion on their revolvers with us. And we approved over $25 billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted. And for our small business clients, we\u2019re actively supporting the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. The numbers you see on the slide are as of April 12th; and as of this morning, we have more than 300,000 in some stage of the application process, representing $37 billion in loans. And we funded $9.3 billion to businesses with over 700,000 employees. And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step, we\u2019ve announced $150 million loan program to give capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment. Now, turning to page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance. For the quarter, the firm reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $0.78 and revenue of $29.1 billion with the return on tangible common equity of 5%. While the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later. But at a high level, these items are, a credit reserve build $6.8 billion; approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives; and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book. It might be an obvious point, but the quarter was really a tale of two cities, January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold. And with that, I thought it would be helpful to talk through some key metrics that highlight this dynamic across our businesses. So, let\u2019s go to page 3. Starting with card sales volume on the top left. In March, we saw a rapid decline in spend initially in travel and entertainment, which then spread to restaurants and retail as social distancing protocols were implemented more broadly. While most spend categories were ultimately impacted, we did see an initial boost to supermarkets, wholesale clubs, and discount stores as people stocked up on provisions. But even that is now starting to normalize. And we saw similar trends in merchant services as highlighted in a significant decline in brick & mortar spend, excluding supermarkets, whereas e-commerce spend has held up well by comparison. In investment banking, in the middle of the page, there was a surge in debt issuance by investment grade clients as the market remained open, and clients\u2019 desire to shore up liquidity was top of mind. It was the largest quarter ever in terms of investment grade debt issuance, led by JPMorgan. And in markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes. And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us. At the same time, we saw accelerating loan growth, primarily driven by revolver draws. And finally, flows in AWM were meaningfully different in March compared to January and February. Long-term flows through February were strong, positive across all asset classes, but this was more than offset by outflows in March. On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows. Onto page four and some more detail about our first quarter results. Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year-on-year, as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII. And noninterest revenue was down 5% driven by the significant items I already mentioned, which were largely offset by higher CIB markets revenue. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up 3%, driven by higher volume and revenue related expenses, continued investments and higher legal expense, all of which were largely offset by structural expense efficiencies. This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion, in line with prior expectations. Now, turning to page 5, we\u2019ll have some more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in card, and $2.4 billion and wholesale with builds primarily due to impact of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices. This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year. In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing for our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs. And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail, and also in oil and gas. We expect other sectors to be impacted to a lesser extent if we avoid a prolonged downturn. We have also assumed that the stress in oil and gas continues with WTI remaining below $40 through the end of 2021. After we closed the books for the quarter, our economists updated their outlook, which now reflect a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP and unemployment. If that scenario were to hold, we would be building in the second quarter and builds could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter. A primary unknown is the duration of the crisis, which will directly impact losses across our portfolio. But that being said, our consumer portfolio skews more prime than the industry average and the effectiveness of government support, customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits while uncertain, undoubtedly will act as mitigants to the losses. And even though our losses will be material, we will be doing what we can to help our customers recover from this crisis, and help our clients stay in business. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page six. Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong, and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress. And that combined with our earnings power is an extraordinary base to absorb the inevitable losses to come. For the quarter, we distributed $8.8 billion of capital to shareholders, which includes $6 billion in net share repurchases up to March 15th. Since then, we stopped our buybacks, which was both a prudent decision at the time and consistent with what we always say, which is that we would prefer to use our capital to serve our customers and clients. This capital distribution outweighed our earnings for the quarter. And this coupled with significant RWA growth resulted in a decline in our CET1 ratio to 11.5%. On RWA, which you can see on the bottom right of the page, the key drivers of growth were market volatility which should subside over time, and more importantly, an increase in lending at this critical time for our clients. Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum. It\u2019s worth noting here that in an environment like this it\u2019s precisely why we have the buffers in the first place. We currently also have capacity and intend to continue to pay the $0.90 dividend pending Board approval. And as you can see in the CET1 walk on the bottom left, it is a small claim on our capital base. And before we move on, just a moment on liquidity. Even with everything we facilitated, our liquidity position remains strong. And looking forward, it\u2019s helpful to remember that we have significant liquidity resources beyond HQLA, including the discount window, if need be. And now, turning to businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 7. CCB reported net income of $191 million, including reserve builds of $4.5 billion. January and February showed a continuation of strength across the business but again, March showed a major shift in trends. And across our consumer segment, we saw a drastic deceleration in spend across all forms of payments, and a decline in origination volumes except in the mortgage refi market. And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows and merchant processing activities, early signs of pressure on payment and frequency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit. Turning back to the results. Revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year. In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9%, driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter. Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further given the current rate environment. Home lending revenue was down 14%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower NII, partially offset by higher net production revenue. And in card and auto, revenue was up 8%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion. Average card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity. Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies. And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, driven by card and consistent with prior expectations. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on page 8. CIB reported net income of $2 billion and an ROE of 9% on revenue of $9.9 billion. Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year, but as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit. At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors. By contrast, the high yield market was effectively closed and high yield spreads widened significantly. As a result, our bridge book commitments were marked down by $820 million. And here, it\u2019s worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was, entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio. As a result of this backdrop, IB revenue of $886 million was down 49% year-on-year, largely driven by the bridge book markdown. IB fees were up 3% year-on-year and we maintained our number one rank with 9.1% wallet share. Advisory was down 22%, not only due to a tough compare but also reflecting delays in regulatory approvals, pushing out the closing of certain large deals. We did however complete more deals than any other banks this quarter. Equity underwriting was up 25% versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March. And debt underwriting was up 15% and an all-time record. We maintained our number one rank with 9.5% share, up 90 basis points from 2019. Lending revenue was up 36% year-on-year, driven by the impact of spread widening on loan hedges. Looking forward, while a rapid recovery in the economy could produce the corresponding rebound in activity, we could also see significant downside risk to our forward-looking pipeline if the downturn is protracted. Now, moving to markets. Here, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32% year-on-year. It\u2019s worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said at Investor Day, markets performance was strong for the quarter. Then, the growing COVID-19 concerns triggered a major correction in equity markets, significant widening of spreads and a spike in volatility, leading to extraordinary government intervention and a substantial change in monetary policy followed by a sharp decline in treasury yields. Simultaneously, we also saw a drop in oil prices. This unique combination of events led to further increased client participation and record trading volumes in several products. Fixed income was up 34%, driven by strong client activity, most notably in rates and currencies and emerging markets. Equity markets was up 28% on strength in equity derivatives, driven by increased client activity. In terms of outlook, it goes without saying that it\u2019s too early to project this performance going forward. In fact, low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind. However, we are in a strong position to continue playing essential role in ensuring the orderly functioning of markets and serving our clients\u2019 needs. And now, on to wholesale payments, the new business unit we\u2019re recording this quarter, comprised of treasury services, trade finance, and the merchant services business, which was previously part of CCB. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year driven by reporting re-classification in merchant services. As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity. In security services, revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances, which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances. In wholesale payments and security services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, may be relatively short lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated. Credit adjustments and other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront. Credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by the net reserve builds I referred to earlier. And finally, expenses of $5.9 billion were up 5%, driven by higher legal and volume-related expenses and continued investments. Now, moving onto commercial banking on page 9. Commercial banking reported net income of $147 million including reserve builds of approximately $900 million. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower rates and the $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances. Gross investment banking revenues were $686 million, down 16% year-on-year compared to a record prior year. While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting. Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity. End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March. C&I loans were up 26% as revolver utilization increased to 44%, which is an all-time high. CRE loans were up 3%. And here, the story remains largely unchanged. Higher originations and commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate lending as we remain selective. Credit costs of $1 billion included the reserve builds I mentioned and $100 million of net charge-offs, largely driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 10. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $664 million with pretax margin of 24% and ROE of 25%. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on higher average market levels and net inflows over the past year. And then, in addition, we saw a record brokerage activity in March related to the recent market volatility. These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations. Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses. Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds and the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth. Net long-term outflows were $2 billion as the strength we saw in January and February was more than offset in March. At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels. Deposits were up 9% year-on-year on growth and interest bearing products. And finally, loan balances were up 11% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate page 11. Corporate reported a net loss of $125 million. Revenue was $166 million, a decline of $259 million year-on-year, primarily due to lower net interest income on lower rates, partially offset by higher net gains on investment securities. Expenses of $146 million were down $65 million year-on-year. And now, let\u2019s turn to page 12 for the outlook. At Investor Day, we showed you a path to 2020 where we expected net interest income to be slightly down from 2019. And obviously, since then, the backdrop has changed significantly. Based on the latest advice and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth in CIB markets and NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year. And to give you an idea for the second quarter, we expect NII to be $13.7 billion. On noninterest revenue, it\u2019s always difficult to provide meaningful guidance and even more so given the current heightened level of uncertainty. But based on our best estimates today, we do expect to see headwinds in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds include a $3.5 billion decrease in noninterest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher CIB markets NII and therefore revenue neutral. We also expect to see pressure on AWM and investment banking fees. And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue-related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day. It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we\u2019ll keep you updated at future earnings calls. So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented. Although we don\u2019t quite know what the path will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers and communities, as we always have been. And we have the talent, resources and operational resiliency to do so. Our employees have proven that being resilient is not just about maintaining operations, it\u2019s also about culture. And that feels stronger than ever with our teams work around the world working harder than ever to continue to serve our clients, customers and communities. We\u2019ve never been more proud of our people and we simply can\u2019t thank them enough. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. And Jamie, we\u2019re glad that you could join us and that you\u2019re well enough to join us. My first question is on the forbearance activity. Jen if you could give us a sense of by product, how many of your clients for example in card and auto, home lending, are in a forbearance state, so they started to defer the payments to the percentage of your clients? And how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios? I believe for total losses, it\u2019s 5.9% over nine quarters for the Fed and 4.1% for company-run. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, first of all, I\u2019ll start with that payment relief and forbearance there. I\u2019ll start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees. We\u2019ve approved payment relief for hundreds of thousands of accounts across consumer lending. And we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time. We\u2019ve paused foreclosures and auto repossessions. And importantly, we\u2019ve made the process easier for our customers through digital and self service options that we\u2019ve built in record time. But, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, those are the numbers, they\u2019re still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think we\u2019ll ultimately see. In mortgage, just to give you context outside of customers asking for forbearance, which is just a little over 4% of our service book at this time, the April 1st payments seems BAU. In card, we\u2019re seeing payment rates down a bit, but still strong. And we\u2019ve seen a slight uptick in late payments in auto. But the quality of these portfolios looks strong coming in as we\u2019ve done surgical risk management over the last few years. And that has made these portfolios more resilient. And then, in terms of how we think about significant government intervention, I mean, I think the ultimate effectiveness of these programs, which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payments or the enhanced unemployment insurance, the ultimate effectiveness is I think, the biggest unknown. The key obviously is being able to bridge people back to employment. And so, we have assumed, as we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that we\u2019ll be providing for our customers. But that is for sure an unknown, and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter. Erika Najarian : Thank you. My second question, you mentioned that you\u2019re prepared to go below 10.5% CET1 to help your clients. Going below 10.5% is also when the automatic restrictions start kicking in from the Fed in terms of payout. So, if I understand it, it would be a 60% payout restriction on eligible net income. And I just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing, servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, as you probably know, Erika, that the Fed made some changes there recently, which, as you say, puts us in a 60% bucket as we go below 10.5%. And we have a reasonable amount of room below 10.5% to remain in the 60% bucket. I would say that that was very helpful clarification from the regulators in terms of how we should think about using regulatory buffers. So, that was particularly helpful. And right now, we are focused on serving our clients and customers. And we\u2019ve looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we\u2019re managing our capital quite carefully. Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman\u2019s letter that we\u2019ve looked at assuming large parts of the economy remaining in lockdown through the end of this year. And in that scenario, our CET1 drops to about 9.5%. And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios. So, we make sure that we\u2019re prepared. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. And welcome back, Jamie. Questions for you. How do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs, as you mentioned in your CEO letter? Jamie Dimon : Yes. No, it\u2019s a very important question. I think in times of need, banks have always been the lender of last resort to their customers. And obviously, you\u2019ve got to be a disciplined capital provider because undisciplined loans are bad. So, you take your calculated risks. We\u2019re making additional loans. We\u2019re adults. We know that if the economy gets worse, we\u2019ll bear additional loss, but we do forecast all of that so we know we can handle really, really adverse consequences. There will be a point -- and the last question brought it up was where you get below 10% CET1, even though we\u2019ll have almost $200 billion in capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in, like SLR and G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that may kind of constrain it. And so, -- and then obviously, then you\u2019ve got to look forward. So, we want to do our job. If we can help the country get through this, everybody\u2019s better off. If we lose a little bit more money in the meantime, so be it. But obviously, we\u2019re going to protect our company, our balance sheet,, our growth and we\u2019ll be having close conversations with regulators about what that is. I also think, you have to take in consideration the extraordinary measures the government has taken. That\u2019s the income to individuals, the PPP and all these Federal Reserve things. Mike Mayo : So, also in your CEO letter, you talk about the economy coming back on, online. And I guess with your reserve build, you\u2019re assuming, what 10% unemployment, and then the economy improves in the second half of the year. So, what is your base case for how people come back to work that\u2019s behind those assumptions? And I know you have a lot of scenarios too but just a base case. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I\u2019ll let Jen talk about the base case. But, I think the back to work, we shouldn\u2019t think of as a binary thing that after the CDC and we all get instructions from the government after there\u2019s enough capacity in the hospitals, after there is proper amount of testing. Remember, a lot of people are going to work today in farms, factories, food production, retail, pharmacies, hospitals. It isn\u2019t like no one\u2019s going to work and you can hope that you can turn it back on where it\u2019s very safe. There\u2019s plenty of capacity. You\u2019re not worried that you can\u2019t give every American who does get sick, the best possible medical advice. And the turn on will be regional by company, all following standards of best health practices. And in some ways you need to get that done because the bad economy has very adverse consequences, way beyond just the economy. In terms of mental health, domestic abuse, substance abuse, et cetera. So, a rational plan to get back to work is a good thing to do. And hopefully it\u2019ll be sooner rather than later, but it won\u2019t be May. We are talking about June, July, August, something like that. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your whole question. And then, Jen, you give the base case. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, Mike, as we closed the books for the first quarter, just to give a context, we were looking at an economic outlook that had GDP down 25% in the second quarter and unemployment above 10%. It\u2019s just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it. But, there\u2019s a lot more that goes in to our reserving including management judgment of some like world class, risk management and finance people, and also other analytics. And so, that just kind of gives you a frame of reference. But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving. And we also thought about the impacts, what\u2019s our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief program. Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment at 20%. That\u2019s obviously materially different. Both scenarios, though, do include a recovery in the back half of the year. And so, all else equal and of course, the one thing probably the only thing we know for sure, Mike is that all else won\u2019t be equal when we close the books for the second quarter. But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter. But again, a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment. And we\u2019re going to still have a number of unknowns, I would say at the end of the second quarter, but we\u2019re going to learn a lot through these next few months that will inform our judgment for second quarter reserves. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey. Good morning. And Jamie, nice to have you back. So, I wanted to ask a question on some of the remarks relating to capital. Carl [ph] has actually made some comments on Friday, alluding to efforts by the Fed to incorporate real life COVID stress in the upcoming CCAR cycle. We haven\u2019t gotten much color since then. I\u2019m wondering whether you received any guidance from the Fed on which changes if any they plan on contemplating for this year\u2019s test. And maybe just bigger picture, how are you thinking about the potential impact that could have on SCB and potentially raise some of your capital requirements? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, we haven\u2019t gotten specific guidance, but it certainly makes sense that the Fed would want to look at a scenario like that. We have been, as you might imagine, staying very close to our regulators through this crisis. So, they can have a very good understanding of how we are managing things. And then, in terms of the potential impact, we\u2019ll learn more about that in June. We\u2019ve given our best estimates of SCB and the impact it will have on our minimums. And that is absolutely incorporated into our thinking about how we\u2019ll manage capital through a range of scenarios here, but we\u2019ll learn more from the Fed in June. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ve always tried [ph] the floor doing one stress test, which will not be the stress you go through. JPMorgan does 100 a week. And we\u2019re always looking at potential outcomes. And obviously we\u2019re doing our own COVID-related type of stress testing, including extreme, and we\u2019ll always be updating them, talking to regulars about it, because that\u2019s what we have to deal with this time, not what I would consider a traditional stress test. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. We look both at -- the range of outcomes probably has never been broader. And so, as Jamie said, we have -- CCAR has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario. But we have looked at a number of different scenarios at how this may play out. And obviously, Jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse, and we\u2019re prepared for that too. So, I think, the most important thing is that we\u2019re prepared for a range of outcomes. And we\u2019ll learn more about SCB in June. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just a follow-up on the securities book. Just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve, Jen, I was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today, just compared with the 2.48% yield on the blended securities book? And then just separately, given the larger impact of QE driven deposit growth, how you\u2019re deploying some of that excess liquidity in this environment? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, on the investment securities portfolio, managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic. And with lower rates, as low as the deposit growth that [Technical Difficulty] with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense. Right now, in terms of balance sheet management, we are completely focused on supporting client activity. Our balance sheet is harder to predict right now, but we are prepared for a range of outcomes. Steven Chubak : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the CECL related question. Jen, you gave us a good amount of color on what the underlying economic assumptions that were used to build the reserves and in where Bruce Kasman and your economics team is now for the second quarter? But maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute them to CECL reserve build? I\u2019m not looking for specific numbers, more just directional. How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes, where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that you\u2019re seeing your book that maybe aren\u2019t showing up in credit measures, but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it within the next few quarters, how much of its growth, how much of its mix, just if you can talk to that? And I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at is, how much of it is more mechanistic, and how much of it is actual tangible signs that you\u2019re seeing that of financial stress in your borrower base that could emerge in a reasonably near future as credit losses? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, it\u2019s great question, Saul. So, I would start by saying that we haven\u2019t actually seen the stress emerge as of yet. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily use the term mechanistic. But I would say that what we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses. It\u2019s also important to note that we don\u2019t reserve for future growth. And so, future growth with all else being equal the reserve build. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of this as materially different because of CECL. We didn\u2019t actually really think about the impact of CECL relative to the incurred model. I mean, the regulators have given their point of view on that, given the change in the capital rules where 25% is assumed to be the difference. But that\u2019s their view. And like I said, we did spend a lot of time thinking about it. And I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis. And it is life of loan, which of course is different under CECL. And so, again, all else equal, you can think hard was larger than it would have been under an incurred model. But we didn\u2019t really think about it that way. And it\u2019s impossible of course to know what judgment we would have applied under a different model. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Jen, just on that point of growth, pivoting a little bit. What -- obviously, a lot of pressure in CET1 was because of risk-weighted asset growth and draw-downs on commitments. Where are we in terms -- where do you think we are in terms of those draw downs? I think, it\u2019s like $350 billion still in wholesale commitment -- unfunded commitments, but like, how do we think about that and how much room there is for that to continue to maybe pressure risk-weighted asset evolution? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. So, like so many other things, it is difficult to predict. I will say that early here in the second quarter, we have seen a pause on revolver draws. But, it could very well just be a pause. And so, we\u2019re assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter, albeit at lower level than the first quarter. And then, of course the timing and the pace of the pay-downs will depend upon the ultimate path of the virus and the economic recovery. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. I appreciate the limited sight we all have. Maybe we could, let\u2019s assume, hopefully sooner than later, we get past the bulk of the credit impact. On the other side of this, have you thought about lending spreads, underwriting criteria and how much terms need to tighten, given what we\u2019ve learned or on a scenario that we didn\u2019t capture under its previous underwriting? In other words, does lending spreads widen? And do you get paid enough for you balance sheet? I\u2019m just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about risk management on a go forward basis? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, there I would say that, our -- we always take a long-term franchise view on things like that. And so, our philosophy has not changed. It is true, however, that the marginal cost of new activity is higher for us right now. And so, that\u2019s a consideration. But, I would say, in terms of risk management, we do what we\u2019ve always done and what we always do, which is manage carefully within our risk appetite. And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis. And we\u2019ll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019d just add, on the consumer side, the forward-looking view of risk, on the wholesale side, the revolvers are taken down, which is like $50 billion, our existing spreads. The bilateral stuff is being done by new credits. They\u2019re being done at slightly different spreads and stuff like that are higher. And then trading, obviously you\u2019re actually getting higher spreads and lot of things you do, and train your finance people and do things and stuff like that. And then you will see a tightening of credit in the market. Think of leverage lending, certain underwriting, sort of non-bank lenders who are no longer there. So, you will see an eventual tightening and eventual increase in spreads. What you won\u2019t see banks do is price gouge, which you see in other industries. Banks are very careful to support their clients in times like this. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then one more impossible question, Jen, maybe. Could you help qualify? I know, you can\u2019t quantify, but exit rate revenues that you\u2019ve kind of alluded to in some of the things like underwriting falling off. So, a tale of two quarters, the quarter itself has learned for the ginormous credit issue that we\u2019re facing. It would have been like, revenues down a little bit, expense is up a drop, okay, but how much of the exit rate revenues are we looking at second quarter, third quarter versus the full first quarter? And that\u2019s a hard one. Jennifer Piepszak : Glenn, I\u2019m glad you acknowledged that it\u2019s impossible question and a hard one. And so, there\u2019s a reason why we gave directional guidance here in terms of what could be headwind, but it is just impossible to predict right now, as you point out. So, but I will say, like -- if you think, there\u2019s obviously nothing that we can really say with confidence about exit rates in 2021. I will say, based upon the latest implies, if you look at NII, you could see growth in 2021 on balance sheet growth there. And then NIR is absolutely going to depend on the path of the virus and the economic recovery and when and how we all get back to work. And then, we\u2019ve given you expense guidance to think about. And then, from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued build over the next several quarters, but the way CECL works in theory, again, all else equal, is that that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year, and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you [Technical Difficulty] I know you gave us the color on the base case [Technical Difficulty] downturn in the second quarter. What\u2019s your outlook on that recovery in the second half of the year? Can you give us any color on what kind of recovery you\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year that\u2019s part of the CECL reserve building? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, it is -- I don\u2019t have the numbers to hand, Gerard, but they\u2019re public. It was -- I suppose you can say, it was based on our economists\u2019 outlook at the end of March, which did have a recovery. I just don\u2019t have the GDP numbers to hand, I think -- and the unemployment. I think what\u2019s most important to note, Gerard, is that what -- based upon what we\u2019re looking at, you do have a recovery in the back half of the year, but it is -- it still leaves you from a GDP perspective and unemployment, below your launch point on absolute levels of GDP and above your launch point on absolute levels of unemployment. So, it\u2019s a recovery, it is our latest outlook. And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time. But it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn\u2019t get us back to where we started. And, importantly, as we said that we\u2019re prepared for a range of scenarios. So, while that may be the case that we based our reserve levels off, it is not being the only scenario that we\u2019re preparing for. Gerard Cassidy : And then, just as a follow-up, on the bridge book, and I apologize if you addressed this and I missed it. I know you guys mentioned the losses in the bridge book. Could you share with us the size of the book, and then some more color on what triggered the losses in the bridge book? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So there, I would just start by -- I said it in the prepared remarks, but it\u2019s worth repeating. Our bridge book is about a quarter of the size it was in the financial crisis. So, it\u2019s about $13 billion. It\u2019s slightly down from where we were at yea-end. Importantly, we don\u2019t have any imminent closing deadlines. And the market is actually performing a little bit better here in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ll see where we land at the end of the quarter. But so far\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : Just basically marking the positions to market\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. And the good news is we\u2019ve built in\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : Fees. [Ph] Jennifer Piepszak : And with no imminent closing deadlines, it\u2019s not necessarily the case that we\u2019ll realize those losses. But as Jamie said, they\u2019re mark to market at the end of the quarter. Jamie Dimon : And I would just also put this in perspective. We\u2019re adults. We know that we have a bridge loan book, because you\u2019re going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money. We\u2019re the leader in leverage lending, we\u2019re the leader in high yield, the leader in loans, et cetera. And we intend to maintain that position. And every now and then you have not a particularly good quarter. So, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t worry about this very much. And like Jen said, so far if you look at spreads, it\u2019s probably a recovery this quarter. Operator : Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi, Jen. Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that you\u2019ve seen so far, and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Hi, John. So, based upon what we\u2019re looking at right now, spend was down. We talked about different categories, but spend in aggregate was down 13% in the month of March, year-over-year, and we\u2019re seeing trends like that continue here in April. And so, with that, I would say that we would, given what we know today, expect outstandings to trend down from here. John McDonald : And then, can you help us think about how you do the accounting for the consumer deferrals? You keep accruing. But, do you add some kind of haircut for NII in suppression in terms of what might not be collectible, even though technically you\u2019re allowed to accrue while you defer? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, you got it John. So, we do continue to accrue, but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just want to -- I had add two questions. One, just thinking about the outlook for the next couple of quarters here. I know you mentioned that your economics team had updated their estimates. And maybe you could give us a sense as to the timing of when you clip your reserves versus those estimate changes? And part of the reason I\u2019m asking is because of the reserve ratio move between 4Q \u201819 and 1Q \u201820 for the various segments. When I look at the CIB and the commercial bank, the reserve ratios are down from where they were in 4Q \u201819. So, I\u2019m trying to understand how the next change in the reserving is likely to traject between the various asset classes? Is there -- as you move from an adverse case to a severely adverse case, are there different asset classes that potentially have a higher uptick in reserve ratio that we should be expecting here? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, on the wholesale side specifically, Betsy, the reason you see that dynamic is because of CECL. And it\u2019s in the presentation. So, you can see the numbers. So, we -- the CECL adoption impact in wholesale was a net release. And so, we\u2019ve now built that. And so, that\u2019s why you see that dynamic there. And then, in terms of the reserving, when we close the books, which was here in early April, we do have to of course kind of snap the chalk line at some point and close the books, which is why we want it to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going forward. Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we\u2019re looking at that we would expect to have a bill in the second quarter and perhaps, beyond, because as I said, obviously everything is incredibly fluid. And we need to -- we really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact. But, we need some time to learn. Jamie Dimon : And also just on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that. It will also be name by name, company by company, name by name, reserve by reserve, so a real detailed review of that. Betsy Graseck : So, as we think through -- because effectively I think what we\u2019re saying is, there\u2019s the possibility of the severely adverse case coming, which we can look back at prior Fed stress tests to see what you anticipated that to mean for the credit losses. And maybe, Jamie, if you get an understanding as to how you\u2019re thinking about, what your economists are looking for versus prior severely adverse stress cases that you have run on your own bank. Is this fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bank-run modeling basis that we have access to and it\u2019s in line with that kind of level or is this something that\u2019s even a little bit tougher, and specifically around like things like commercial real estate? I get the name by name on the corporate side, that that is obviously extraordinarily granular and you have access to that. But I\u2019m wondering on the commercial real estate side, is there anything we should be thinking about that\u2019s different from perhaps what a Fed stress test might have suggested in the past? Jamie Dimon : I think commercial real estate, eventually it will be loan by loan and name by name too. So, you have reason to believe that a loan is bad, you\u2019re going to write it down and put a reserve against it or something like that. This is such a dramatic change of events. So, there are no models that have done -- dealt with GDP down 40%, unemployment growing this rapidly. And that\u2019s one part. There are also no models ever dealt with a government, which is doing a PPP program, which might be $350 billion and might be $550 billion. Unemployment, where -- it looks like 30% to 40% of people going [ph] on unemployment with higher income than before they went on unemployment. So, what does that mean for credit card or something like that or that the government is just going to make direct payments to people. So, this is all in the works right now. The Company is very good shape. We can serve our clients and we\u2019re going to give you more detail on this, but it\u2019s happening as we speak. And I think people are making too much of a mistake to model it. When we get to the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ll know exactly what happens in the second quarter. Like, you know -- you\u2019ve got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up that we\u2019ve seen very little bit so far. But, in the second quarter, you\u2019ll see more of it. And then, we\u2019ll also know if there\u2019s a fourth round of government stimulus, we\u2019ll know a whole bunch of stuff and we\u2019ll report that out. We hope for the best, which is, you have that recovery and plan for the worst, so you can handle it. Jennifer Piepszak : And then, in terms of planning for the worst, Betsy, maybe it\u2019d be helpful. The extreme adverse scenario that Jamie referenced in his Chairman\u2019s letter had 2020 credit cost of more than $45 billion. So, clearly that is not our central case, but that\u2019s the kind of scenario that we are making sure that we\u2019re prepared for. And then, just coincidentally, if you look at our credit costs from the fourth quarter of \u201808 to the fourth quarter of \u201809 across those five quarters, we had credit cost of $47 billion. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ve got the number where reserves went from like $7 billion to $35 billion back to $14 billion. Reserve in itself is counter -- pro-cyclical and often wrong. And you\u2019re required to do it, but it certainly doesn\u2019t match revenues and expenses. And so, we\u2019d like to be conservative in reserving, but I have to point out the flaws of it. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a couple of questions, again one on CECL maybe to start with. Can you just maybe give a little bit more qualitative disclosure on how this payment relief factors in? I mean, are you assuming some amount of government programs get used and that\u2019s included or that\u2019s just payment relief that you\u2019re directly giving to consumers and corporate? Just trying to get a sense of how all these government programs going to flow through the model. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure, Brian. So, you can think about the government stimulus as being incorporated in the macroeconomic variables; and then, the payment relief. Those are -- I\u2019m referring to our own programs there. And there, based upon our judgment and experience from the past, we applied some percentage of pull-through in the portfolio of people who will get payment relief, and then we think about the impact that that could have. Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we\u2019ll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter. Jamie Dimon : And Jen remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we\u2019re going to lay out lots of these various assumptions about CECL. And one of the problems with CECL is this precisely. We\u2019re going to spend all day on CECL, which was $4 billion and it\u2019s kind of a drop in the bucket, but it\u2019s a lot of data. It\u2019s like all the data we did after the last crisis we give you on level three, and all these assumptions and stuff like that. No one ever looks it anymore. Jennifer Piepszak : That\u2019s right. Jamie Dimon : And every company does it differently. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. And we still have obviously several weeks and so -- before the Q. And so, we\u2019ll be able to give our best view on things then. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then, in the quarter -- I mean, you gave what the marks were on the bridge loan. But, is there a way to frame what the total marks were, I mean assuming credit spreads tighten kind of dramatically post quarter end? So, it seems like, it would be a reversal of some of those marks initially? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes, there could be. But, that\u2019s only where we are at this point in the quarter. And so, it\u2019ll obviously all depend on the market from now until the end of the quarter. But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned. Jamie Dimon : A couple of deals may be syndicated, but hopefully, might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : [Technical Difficulty] earnings are -- pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs [Technical Difficulty]. Jamie Dimon : I don\u2019t know about you guys. I can\u2019t -- we can\u2019t understand a word you are saying. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Chris, this is unfortunately part of our -- all of our new reality is we all work remotely. We couldn\u2019t hear you. Chris Kotowski : Sorry. Is this better? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Chris Kotowski : Okay. So, my apologies. At Investor Day, Jamie said something like that the real economic earnings are pre provision earnings minus net charge-offs, which I agree with. And so, if you push aside all the CECL reserving noise, I\u2019m curious, does the customer relief, the 90-day grace period, does that change the -- alter the historic charge-off assumptions? Like for example, I mean, credit card was always pretty cookie cutter, 180 days after delinquency is charged off and maybe with auto, or will those customer relief periods push back the charge-off curve as well? Jennifer Piepszak : It may, because as long as the customer is performing under the forbearance program, they are not delinquent. But of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment. Chris Kotowski : Okay. So\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We\u2019ll clearly know a lot more in 90 days about how this effect is, what we would have expected? Jennifer Piepszak : And to Jamie\u2019s point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course whether programs have been effective or whether they just delayed losses. And, of course with CECL being life of loan, if it is just delayed losses, you can expect that that would -- we would be reserving for that. Chris Kotowski : Okay. But, in terms of charge-offs [Technical Difficulty]. Am I getting that right? Jennifer Piepszak : It may be. It may be. But again, it\u2019s going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or forbearance program. But, we don\u2019t really think about it that way. We think about what the ultimate losses will be and we reserve for that. And then importantly, in the first quarter, the charge-offs we\u2019re seeing, which is why I was clear to say it was consistent with prior expectations. Because the charge-offs in the first quarter of course don\u2019t at all reflect the ultimate impact of COVID-19. They were just normal BAU, I would say. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim, SocGen. Andrew Lim : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, firstly, on government guarantee loans. These are 0% risk-weighted. And I\u2019m wondering, to what extent you\u2019re using them to refinance existing loans on your portfolios. And if you are, to what extent risk-weighted assets have gone through, if you do this? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. And that\u2019s just specifically what program you\u2019re referring to. I would just say, broadly speaking, on the Fed facilities, there are obviously very large programs rolled out very quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions. Here, we are happy to leverage facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients. But, we are only using them where it makes sense to ensure the credit and liquidity is flowing to where it\u2019s needed. Andrew Lim : So, I mean, just to maybe elaborate on that. Is there maybe some part where there\u2019s a bit of a capital uplift, if you use government guaranteed loans to represent risk-weighting where previously you\u2019ve... Jamie Dimon : What uplift? Andrew Lim : A capital uplift, so, your risk-weighted assets go down, say for something like [Technical Difficulty] government guaranteed\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We\u2019ll incorporate all of that into how we run the company trying to serve client et cetera, et cetera. And there few things, like the PPP that you put on your balance sheet is zero RWA but it does affect a lot of other things, like SLR and G-SIFI and stuff like that. Because if you sell it to the government, those -- it all goes away. And we will manage through that as we learn how these programs are working and what want to do. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Thanks, everyone. Jamie Dimon : Thank you for spending time with us. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $4.7 billion, EPS of $1.38 and record revenue of $33.8 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 9%. Included in these results are a number of significant items. First, a credit reserve build of $8.9 billion, and then approximately $700 million of gain in our bridge book and $500 million of gains in credit adjustments and other, both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter. As we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment, this quarter's performance once again demonstrates the benefit of the diversification and scale of our platform. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights here. CIB reported its highest quarterly revenue on record with IB fees up 54% and markets revenue up 79% year-on-year, each representing record performances with strength across the board. We saw record consumer deposit growth of 20%, up over $130 billion year-on-year and firm-wide average deposits were $1.9 trillion, up about 25% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Average loans were up 4% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely reflecting the COVID-related loan growth that we saw in March. However, on an end-of-period basis, loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter due to revolver pay downs as well as lower balances in Card and Home Lending, partially offset by the impact of $28 billion of PPP loans. And lastly, we increased our CET1 ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter after building approximately $9 billion of reserves and paying nearly $3 billion of common dividends. As you\u2019ll recall, we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in March. On the following pages, I'll give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what we're seeing today. So with that, let's turn to page two. Starting with wholesale on the top of the page, we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter as clients bought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws for March and continued to shore up liquidity while market conditions were receptive, supported by extraordinary central bank actions. The surge in investment grade debt issuance seen in March continued throughout the second quarter. And as high yield markets reopened, U.S. issuance volumes increased by 90% compared to the first quarter. In ECM as markets rebounded to pre-COVID levels, May and June together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever, driven by converts and follow-ons. Moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left. Debit and credit sales volume, while overall still down has consistently trended upward since the trough in the second week of April to down just 4% year-on-year in the last two weeks of June. T&E and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully but we have seen some improvement, especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend. The most significant improvement we saw was in retail with a strong recovery in card-present volume in the second half of the quarter, and consistently strong growth in card-not-present volume throughout the quarter. More recently, we\u2019ve seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out, notably in both states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases. We continued to see larger year-on-year declines in states that remain partially closed, particularly those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. In terms of consumers\u2019 demand for credit, we observed similar recovery trends. In auto, April saw the lowest level of loan and lease origination since the financial crisis, but activity rebounded sharply in May and June, and in fact, June ended up the best month for auto originations in our history. And in Home Lending, retail purchase applications after reaching a low in April recovered to well above pre-COVID levels in June, due to a strong and broad market recovery. Continuing on the topic of consumer behavior, let's turn to page three for an update on what we're seeing around our customer assistance programs. Relative to the peak levels we observed at the beginning of April, we've seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter. To date, we have provided customer assistance for nearly 1.7 million accounts, representing $79 billion of balances across both our owned and service portfolios, and of those accounts, a large percentage, having made at least one payment while in the forbearance period, just over 50% in both Card and Home Lending. In terms of early reenrollment trends, in cards, only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial 90-day deferral period and reached the payment date, but the majority of those customers resumed payments with less than 20% of accounts requesting additional assistance. And then, in Home Lending, of those whose forbearance period expired in June, most have either been extended at a customer's request or auto-enrolled into new three-month forbearances with approximately 40% of the extensions still current. And so, while we're following this data closely, it's still too early to draw any conclusions. Now, moving on to page four for some more detail about our second quarter results. We recorded revenue of $33.8 billion, which was up $4.3 billion or 15% year-on-year. While net interest income was down approximately $600 million or 4% on lower rates, mostly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth, non-interest revenue was up $4.9 billion or 33%, predominantly driven by CIB markets and IB fees. Expenses of $16.9 billion were up approximately $700 million or 4% year-on-year on revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses. This quarter, credit costs were $10.5 billion, including a net reserve build of $8.9 billion and net charge-off of $1.6 billion. Let's turn to page five for more detail on the reserve builds. Our net reserve build of $8.9 billion for the quarter consists of $4.6 billion in wholesale and $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly card. The reserve increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but short-lived downturn with a solid recovery in the second half of the year. And while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks, there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery. At the bottom of the page, you can see our updated base case, but remember this is just one of five scenarios we use to derive our allowance for credit losses. Our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower GDP recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of 2021. In addition to the obvious impact on consumer, its protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad-based impact across wholesale sectors that we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Given the increased uncertainty of the macroeconomic outlook, how customer payment behavior will play out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both, consumers and wholesale clients, we've put more meaningful weight on the downside scenario this quarter. And so therefore, we're prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case. And given CECL covers life of loan, if our assumptions are realized, we wouldn't expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page six. WE ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, which is over 100 basis points above our new SCB base minimum of 11.3%. And just to touch on SLR, while our reported ratio is 6.8%, it's worth noting that we're not going to rely on temporary relief and so without that our ratio is 5.7%. As we said in late June, unless things change meaningfully, the Board intends to maintain the $0.90 dividend in the third quarter. Given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward, I'd like to spend a few minutes on why we're comfortable saying that including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how we're managing our capital through this crisis. So, with that, let's go to page seven. It's an obvious point, but it's worth a reminder that since 2018, our average quarterly PPNR of over $13 billion has been generating over 60 basis points of new CET1 capacity per quarter, even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses. This powerful earning stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need it most. And it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish capital in times of stress. While over the last two and a half years, we've paid out approximately 100% of cumulative earnings, distributing nearly $75 billion of excess capital, we're now building a significant amount of capital since we suspended our share repurchases. And we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios, which you can see on page eight. Standing here today, we have $34 billion of reserves and $191 billion of CET1 capital, of which $16 billion is excess over and above our regulatory buffers. Our 3.3% SCB translates to $51 billion of capital that is available to free from stress at any time. And on top of that, our 3.5% GSIB surcharge translates to another $54 billion, all that so our $69 billion regulatory minimum is never touched. And as you know, we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios, and one of them is Extreme Adverse scenario that Jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year. We've updated this analysis and it now assumes an even deeper contraction to GDP, down nearly 14% at the end of 2020, versus 4Q19 and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly 22%. Even under this scenario, we estimate that we would end the year with a CET1 ratio above 10% and we would be bound by advanced. So, our regulatory minimum would be 10.5%. While we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers, this scenario would require us to do so, but notably only to a small extent. It's also worth noting that based on the limited information provided from the Fed about their U and W scenarios, we believe that our Extreme Adverse scenario simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next 12-months. And even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high, we still wouldn't use the entire SCB. Jamie Dimon : This is Jamie. I\u2019d just like to amply a couple of these points. So, we are showing this example, obviously it\u2019s predicated on a lot of assumptions, which we're not going to give you a lot of detail on, just simply to show that we could bear another $20 billion of loan loss reserves. That $20 billion brings us to an Extreme Adverse, which roughly may equate to U or W of the Fed, and we're going to do a lot more analysis on that because obviously we need to prepare for that. We dip into advanced CET1, that\u2019s because we're taking no actions. So, I\u2019ve always told you that advanced capital is very pro-cyclical. So, as things get downgraded, your RWA goes way up. The capital base doesn't change that much, but the RWA goes way up. And there\u2019d be lots of actions we would take that we could avoid that from taking place whatsoever. The other thing I want to point out is this Extreme Adverse probably can't happen in one quarter. It will happen in several quarters. Because we really know kind of what July looks like and August and stuff like that. So, even if the economy starts to head there, it will take us a couple of quarters before you make the determination that that has a 100% possibility. Remember, this is saying, we now believe it\u2019s 100%. Of course, things can be worse by the way, but we're just trying to show you that how much capital the Company does have. And the dividend -- now I\u2019m going to be -- it sounds like I\u2019m going to contradict myself. I am not. Okay? Today, we have all that PPNR, all of that earnings, all the things. So, it\u2019d be kind of foolish to get the future of Extreme Adverse and cut your dividend. Because we can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend. However, if you enter something like Extreme Adverse, all of a sudden, you have new scenarios which are even worse. You don't know. So, at one point, the Board will consider cutting the dividend because it will basically get even worse in Extreme Adverse and we want to be able to handle anything out there. The primary concern of the Company is to serve our clients, serve our community through thick and think, and no one should ever worry about JPMorgan Chase. So, there's no intent to do it. But if things get really bad, I mean, we use the word materially and significantly, that\u2019s something we should look at. The other thing, by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the CCAR type of stuff. You all are doing estimates that show DFAST and Fed adverse. We will not move that kind of money on credit. Okay? And on the next page, Jen\u2019s going to explain some stuff. I'm going to make a few slight additional comments. I also want you to -- she said that we're not going to use temporary buffers. I think, the temporary is a funny thing to go into a crisis that you could use it for a while but disappears on March 1st or February 1s. So, my view is, we shouldn't rely on anything like that. Jennifer Piepszak : And I\u2019ll just add Jamie to the point on advanced RWA. If you look on the slide and you can see we traveled from 13.1% to 10.4%. About half of that is just the RWA increasing and the other half is the [indiscernible]. So, anyway, as Jamie said, moving on to page nine. All of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still has opportunity for recalibration. So, while we talked about this for years, it has perhaps never been more important. I'll start with CCAR and Jamie just made this point. But, it is not predictive of what we actually think would happen. And the best example of this might be the global market shock. It is a significant portion of the SCB, and we've obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of 2020. So, we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework, including the points we've repeatedly made about GSIB. These changes will foster a higher pace of economic growth over time without compromising financial stability. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Again, I just want to emphasize couple of things here. So, look, the point of CCAR was that banks can handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong. CCAR itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be. So, all the CCAR tests roughly equate to global financial crisis and all the CCAR tests always have us losing somewhere between $25 billion and $30 billion over the ensuing nine quarters. But, in ensuing nine quarters at the Lehman, we made $30 billion. We never lost money in a quarter. We take action, we diversify, we've got to have streams of earnings. And we're not against CCAR, because that's protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst. But that's not necessarily predictive. The global market shock, which I think they have $25 billion in counterparty losses. Again, just to be instructive of that, in \u201808 and \u201809, you had Fannie Mae go bankrupt, Freddie Mac go bankrupt, you had Bear Stearns effectively, you had Lehman Bros. effectively, you had AIG effectively, you had tons of financial institutions in Europe, tons of counterparty failures and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of $4 billion, not $25 billion. And of course, it was quickly made back because as we pointed out, when things get bad in trading, spreads gap out, and then all of a sudden you're making more money trading because you -- and you have recoveries in position. So, the stress capital buffer of 3.3% is not indicative of what we would lose. And so, -- and I hope over time, we could drive that down by taking real actions to a number close to 2.5%. GSIB itself, I pointed out before, I'm not against the concept of big banks and the more capital. But GSIB is -- it's not the same CCAR. CCAR includes your diversification, your strength, your earnings, your PPNR, and things like that, GSIB does not. It\u2019s just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over. It doesn't include diversification. It doesn't include margins. It doesn't include actions. It doesn't include -- it's just really not representative of all, but I would say is risk of a company or something like that. And so, we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff, which is we've always run the Company that way, so that we can handle at adverse times because in my short lifetime, I've seen crises over and over and over and over. We're not predicting them. We're just prepared for them. So, I stop there. Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Thank you. All right. So, let's go onto the businesses. So, we'll start on page 10 with Consumer & Community Banking. So, CCB reported a net loss of $176 million, including reserved builds of $4.6 billion. Revenue of $12.2 billion was down 9% year-on-year, driven by deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity, and customer relief, partially offset by strong deposit growth and Home Lending margin expansion. The deposit margin was down 108 basis points a year-on-year on a sharp decline in rates, but deposit growth was a record 20% year-on-year, up over $130 billion. We would estimate that approximately 50% of that growth is COVID-related due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses, lower consumer spending and tax payment delays. Mobile users were up 10% year-on-year. And since the start of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen increased levels of digital engagement. For example, quick deposit enrollment is up 2 times pre-COVID levels. As I noted earlier for consumer lending, the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued to evolve. Auto loan and lease originations were down 9% year-on-year due to the exit of the Mazda partnership. Excluding this impact, auto originations for up mid-single-digits. And while the Home Lending market was favorable, Home Lending total originations were down 1% year-on-year, driven by a decline in correspondent volume substantially offset by an increase in retail volume. Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending down 14% due to prior loan sales and card down 7% and lower spend, offset by business banking up 59% due to PPP originations. Expenses of $6.6 billion we're down 3%, driven by lower travel-related benefit, structural and marketing expenses. And lastly credit costs included the $4.6 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-off of $1.3 billion, driven by card.  Now, turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 11. CIB reported net income of $5.5 billion and an ROE of 27% on revenue of $15.4 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was up 91% year-on-year, largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets, as well as the gains on our bridge book, which was primarily a function of improved market conditions. IB fees for the quarter were an all time record, up 54% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank and grew market share to the 9.8% for the first half of the year. In advisory, we were up 15%, driven by the closing of a few notable transactions. That underwriting fees were up 55%. We maintained our number one rank in overall wallet and we\u2019re the leaders and the lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 93% and we grew share by approximately 200 basis points relative to the first quarter. With regards to outlook, we expect third quarter IB fees to be down, both sequentially and year-on-year due to the usual seasonal decline and lower M&A announcements year-to-date. And if the economy begins to stabilize, we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels. However, any sustained period of instability could result in additional demand for liquidity, and therefore increase capital markets activity. Moving to markets, total revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79% year-on-year, an all-time record, driven by strong performance throughout the quarter, and it was only later in June that activity began to revert to more normal levels. We saw strength across products and regions for both flow training and large episodic transactions. While strong line activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme, our market-making activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity, and we were able to better monetize flows. Fixed income was up 99% year-on-year or 120%, adjusted for the gain from the IPO of Tradeweb last year, driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products, particularly in macro. Equity was up 38%, largely driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash. Looking forward, we expect the slowdown that we started to see towards the end of June, to continue. In addition, the second half of last year was very strong, making any year-on-year comparison difficult. But obviously, the environment makes forecasting markets performance even more challenging than usual. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by our reporting reclassification and merchant services. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year-on-year as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volume and higher average deposit balances. Credit adjustments and other was a gain of $510 million, as I mentioned upfront, driven by the tightening of funding spent on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 19% compared to the prior year due to revenue-related expenses. Finally, credit cost of $2 billion reflects the net reserve build I referred to earlier. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on page 12. Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $691 million, which included reserve build of approximately $2.4 billion. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher deposits and loans and equity investment gain and higher investment banking revenue, largely offset by lower deposit NII. Record gross investment banking revenues of $851 million were up 44% year-on-year, due to increased bonds and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $899 million were down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $237 billion were up 41% year-on-year as the increase in balances from March has largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment. End of period loans were up 7% year-on-year but down 4% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 7% quarter-on-quarter as revolver utilization while still elevated has declined significantly from the all-time highs in March. However, this is partially offset by the impact of PPP loans. CRE loans were flat with generally lower originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. Credit costs for $2.4 billion included the reserve build mentioned earlier and $79 million of net charge-offs, roughly half of which were in oil and gas. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 13. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $658 million with pretax margin and ROE of 24%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was up 1% year-on-year as growth in average deposit and loan balances along with higher brokerage activity was largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.5 billion were down 3% year-on-year with lower structural as well as volume and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by continued investments in advisors. Credit costs were $223 million, driven by the reserve builds that I mentioned earlier. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $29 billion, positive across all channels and all regions, led by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity inflows of $95 billion, making us the number one institutional money manager globally. AUM of $2.5 trillion and overall client assets of $3.4 trillion, up 15% and 12% year-on-year respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, deposits were up 20% year-on-year on growth in interest-bearing products and loans were up 12% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on page 14. Corporate reported a net loss of $568 million. Revenue was a loss of $754 million, down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by lower interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities. And expenses of $147 million were down $85 million year-on-year. Now, let's turn to page 15 for the outlook. You'll see here that despite the uncertain environment, our latest full year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance. Based on the latest insights, we expect net interest income to be approximately $56 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $65 billion, which is slightly higher than expected previously, reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter, and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year. So, to wrap up, against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment, our second quarter performance highlighted the benefits of our diversification and scales and the resulting earnings power of our company. While the range of outcomes is broader than ever before, our priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on supporting our employees, customers, clients and communities around the globe, and on being good stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders. I'd like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this crisis and our people here at JPMorgan Chase, who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these times. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous. John McDonald : Good morning, Jen and Jamie. Jen, I was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to heavily COVID impacted sectors across CRE and C&I, so thinking oil and gas, travel and retail, just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve building was directed towards this quarter. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, I'll start by saying, the most impacted sectors, like the ones that you mentioned, represent about a third of our overall exposure. More than half of that is investment grade and two thirds of the non-investment grade is secured. And in terms of the second quarter downgrades, well, first I'd say, in the first quarter, when we were really looking at a deep but short-lived downturn, we were really very much focused on the most impacted sectors. And now that we're looking at a more protracted downturn, we're reserved for a much more broad-based impact across sectors. So, just to put that in context, the second quarter reserve build, about 40% of that is in the most impacted sectors versus two thirds of the builds in the first quarter, was the most impacted sectors. And then, in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter, less than a third of those were in the most impacted sectors. John McDonald : And just for your definition of most impacted sectors, what would you be including in that? Jennifer Piepszak : Consumer and retail, oil and gas, real estate, retail and lodging, and sub-sectors, as you think about real estate. John McDonald : Okay. Just a quick follow-up question. You maintained the NII outlook for the year, despite a pretty big drop in net interest margin. Could you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for NII and maybe how trading NII might play into the thinking? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. It's a great question. And you're spot on, which is markets help NII. So, the outperformance in markets helps NII, but can be a headwind on NIM, just given that the NIM is below the average. So, yes, it was maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance of markets. You're right. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Jennifer, just to kick off with a question, on page three, you went through a lot of detail around the forbearance that you've been given and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the deferral period. Could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that you've outlined in your base case, what are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming? Jennifer Piepszak : So, I won't go into specific details, but I'll just say a couple of things, which is, it is still too early to really read a whole lot into what we're seeing. The visibility here remains low I would say given the amount of support that is out there. But, you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk, given that they are in forbearance program. So, we did account for that as we thought about our reserves. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Because I'm thinking, all right, you've got the inverse of the right hand column could be construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time. And I'm wondering, as a follow-up question, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that if your assumptions are realized that you could be basically close to fully reserved for the cycle. Maybe if you can give us a sense as to which assumptions you are talking about because I know you're expecting an outcome that's worse than your base. So, I was just a little confused about what I should assume your base cases and what assumptions you're pointing to that if realized, you're done on the reserving. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, first of all, there are a lot of assumptions, given as I said, the visibility is still quite low. So, assumptions around the economic outlook and I'll come back to that; assumptions around consumer payment behavior; and then assumptions around stimulus. So, going back to the economic outlook, we have five different scenarios. We did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios, relative to what we would have otherwise done. Even the Fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios and their base case. So, we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do. And so, as you look at that slide five, that is just the base case. So, you can see there, exiting this year just under 11%. When you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios, we end up with double-digit unemployment through the first half of 2021 versus what you see on page five, there is just the base case, which shows some improvements relative to the fourth quarter getting down to just under 8% by the end of 2021. Jamie Dimon : Betsy, as I just clarify, the base case, if you took Morgan Stanley's estimates or Mike Feroli or JP Morgan or the Fed estimates for their base case, that is basically the base case. Embedded in that are all these assumptions about that stimulus and P2P and all these are things. So, that is the base case, and we're reserved more than that. So, therefore, if the base case happens, we may be over-reserved. I hope the base case happens. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a quick follow-up on the consumer and delinquencies. Obviously, you had an impact from deferral programs and delinquencies -- actually 30-day delinquencies were actually down. Can you talk to what you're seeing in the non-deferral programs? It doesn't seem like we're seeing much stress at all, even in the early stage delinquencies. What would you attribute that to? What are you seeing is your non-deferral programs? Jennifer Piepszak : I mean, simply I would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus. And so, as I said, the visibility on what we're dealing with is very, very low, because we're not seeing right now what you would typically expect to see, given a recession. And so, the way we have to think about reserving is all about the outlook, because we're not actually seeing it today. And so, Jamie has said this many times, May and June will prove to be the easy bumps in terms of its recovery. And now we're really hitting the moment of truth, I think in the months ahead. Jamie Dimon : Yes. And just to amplify, in the normal recession, unemployment goes up, delinquencies go up, charges go up, home prices go down. None of that's true here. Incomes go down, savings go down. Savings are up, incomes are up, home prices are up. So, you will see the effect of this recession. You're not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact, 60% or 70% of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working. So, it\u2019s just very peculiar times. Jim Mitchell : Maybe a follow-up on DFAST. Jamie, you made comments about the market shock. We kind of went through a market shock and everyone's trading held up quite well. Do you see that changing the Fed's view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book, or is it -- or you don\u2019t think that's too optimistic? Jamie Dimon : I don't expect any change. And like I said, they're not -- what they're looking at is they are making sure a bank can withstand the bad -- as if they were all the worst bank. They're not giving credit to banks for things happy and good. So I'm not against that concept. I just want to say, if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong, what happens to your trading or something like that? And they do the same assumptions like outflows. The outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis. But, they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Sure. Thanks. Quick question on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously, there's tremendous balance sheet growth as liquidity built up in the quarter. But, how are we thinking about that on a go forward basis? Is that expected to roll off over the next couple quarters? Is that kind of persistent and expected to stick around, and you\u2019re just going to be operating with a much larger balance sheet in near term? Jennifer Piepszak : So, I'll start with deposits. I mean, in the first quarter, it was very much a wholesale story. And we said we expected to normalize, and we have seen that. We started to see that. So, looking ahead on wholesale, I think there are puts and takes. We'll continue to see revolvers pay down, security services will likely continue to normalize. I think, tailwinds for deposits Fed balance sheet expansion will be slower but will continue. And we do think we'll continue to see organic growth. On the consumer side, probably down from here on tax payments as well as the pickup in consumer spending. But, in both cases, I think we'll continue to see very, very strong year-on-year growth, both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year. And then, in terms of balance sheet management, I mean, we managed the balance sheet across multiple dimensions, NII, liquidity, capital and interest rate risk. And so, we have had $400 billion of deposit growth since the end of last year. And when you consider, as you know that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished, given the rate environment, we have held a decent amount of that in cash. However, we did add about $88 billion in securities here in the second quarter and on the deposit side, we've been very-disciplined on a pay rates. Brian Kleinhanzl : So, if those deposits have grown, we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into securities? Are you looking to fund loans on those? Jamie Dimon : As the Fed grows the balance sheet, it\u2019s going to end up in deposits. And for the most part, a lot of deposits is going to be securities. Because the loan growth usually go to recession doesn't go up that much. Jennifer Piepszak : We should see -- as consumer spending recovers, we should see some growth in cards, which will help but will have PPP starting to pay down, and as Jamie said, loan growth, but slightly slower. Jamie Dimon : I should point out that look at the big numbers. We have over $1 trillion between cash held at the central banks, which is close to $400 billion or $500 billion; treasuries, which is close to $700 billion; and other very liquid assets, mostly in good securities, that's $1 trillion. People look at the safety and soundness of institution like this. That is a tremendous sum of money. Some is required -- we are required to hold a lot of liquidity, but of some it just because we're investing conservatively. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some charge-off. Obviously there's a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance, but what are your assumptions in terms of when charge-offs start growing up, maybe where they peak and how long they at that level? Jennifer Piepszak : It's really difficult to know. I mean, first, we have to start seeing delinquencies. And so later this year -- but next year will be much heavier on charge-off, as you think about realizing the assumptions that we've made in the reserves. It's very -- it\u2019s difficult to know. The good thing is CECL is life of loan. So, we feel well covered for the scenarios that we're looking at. Matt O'Connor: And then, remind us, you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets. Obviously, it's off low levels, but they are starting to go up. And remind us why that's not starting to feed into net charge-offs, or if this is just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or two? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. When you look at that non-accrual increase in wholesale, half of that is one client. So, it's really -- I wouldn't draw any conclusions from that. And as you say, it's creeping up off a very low level. So again, we still aren't seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just more on the reserve question. So, if the Fed\u2019s base case is achieved, then you are over reserved. If your base case assumptions.... Jamie Dimon : We hope we\u2019re over-reserved\u2026 Mike Mayo : And if your base case assumptions, which are more conservative, are realized, then okay, you're done with the reserve building. And if it's worse, then you'll have to add more reserves. But since the end of the quarter, we're seeing an increase in COVID cases in Florida and Texas and California and elsewhere. And isn't there a link between increasing COVID cases with deaths with economic activity, or how do you think about that? And I'm staring at slide two, and I can't get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales volume. And it seems like it's flattening off here in June. So, since the end of the quarter, A, if you were to kind of mark-to-market your thinking as of this second with what's happening, do you feel better, worse or the same versus the end of the quarter, as it relates to your assumptions? Jamie Dimon : We feel exactly the same today that we did at the end of the quarter that's sort of mark to market. And Mike, we are very clear. We cannot forecast the future. We don't know. We\u2019re also very clear that -- I know at least I think you're going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June and that -- you have to be prepared. You're going to have a lot of ins and outs. People get scared about COVID. They\u2019re going to get scared about the economy, small businesses, the companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So, it is just going to be murky, which is why, if you look at the base case, adverse and extreme adverse case, they're all possible. And we're just guessing the probabilities of those things. That's what we're doing. We are prepared for the worst case. We simply don't know. I don't think anyone knows. And this -- the word unprecedented rarely is used properly. This time, it\u2019s been used properly. It's unprecedented what's going on around the world. Obviously, COVID itself is a main attribute. So, the Fed\u2019s W case, they made it very clear. Their W case is that COVID comes back in a big way in the fall, and you have to shut down the economy again. And obviously, we\u2019ve got to be careful. We don't know the probability of that. We simply don't know, by the way we\u2019re wasting time guessing. Jennifer Piepszak : And then, I would just add Mike, just to clarify that we are reserved for something worse than the base case. And for all the reasons you said, they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside scenarios. And so, while there is a bit of a -- we hope, a conservative bias here, this does represent our best estimate based upon everything we know, which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activities. Mike Mayo : And my follow-up would be kind of the flip side, during this very difficult time, you've grown deposits over the past year equal to the fifth largest bank. I mean, the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here. So, you said half of that is due to COVID. But is the other half due to share gains, so I guess there's several questions in that. But, how much of that is related to digital banking and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed? Jennifer Piepszak : So, I talked a little bit about kind of how we're thinking about deposits looking forward. Also I do clarify, like when we said 50% COVID-related. That was on the consumer side. And so, that we do think some of that will lead with tax payments and consumer spending coming back. And then, in terms of how much of this is share gain, it's difficult to know. At this point, historically, we have performed well in lower rate environments. And I think you're right, I think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : The first question is for Jamie. A lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions, which you've proven today, but are hesitant about bank stocks, given the overhang of DFAST resubmissions in the fourth quarter, and what that could imply for the dividend. And I guess, I just -- I know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering, under the scenario that you see, playing out and relative to that 60 basis points of CTE1 generation per quarter, what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that Extreme Adverse case? Jamie Dimon : That's completely sustainable. And if we enter the Extreme Adverse case, the Board should and will consider reducing it. As I pointed out, the Extreme Adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend. The reason they would consider reducing it, is because once you enter like 14% or 15% unemployment, you don't know the future. So, now you're going to have another Extreme Adverse case, which is going to be 20% unemployment. And therefore, you protect yourself from that and cutting the dividend is cheap equity. And so, the goal is to sustain the dividends. You can look at the numbers. It\u2019s completely miniscule relative quarter-by-quarter. So, this decision could be made, as you enter these things. And we're all hoping the base case happens. Erika Najarian : And just as a quick follow-up, we also got this question from investors, in the Extreme Adverse case, is there a preference towards cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two? Jamie Dimon : There's no difference between the two. You cut your dividend. You got to hopefully put it back when the time comes. And so, the temporary suspension just sounds peculiar. It's a suspension. And I've done that twice in my life. It's a prudent thing to do. And if you might need that capital going forward, you could think you're going to get that terrible, something like that. So, then the other thing, you can ask the other question. If the base case happens, we're going to end up with far too much capital generation. And we'll start buying back stock again, which I hope we can do before it goes way up. Operator : Our next question\u2026 Jamie Dimon : We don't expect that this year. But, I wouldn't completely rule it out in the fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Question for you. So, we had this big market rebound in the overall markets and that's led to a lot of revenue. But, given this outlook on the uncertain past that we've been talking through this whole time, I'm curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on balance sheet. Now, some of it is just this huge liquidity buildup is a derisked balance sheet. I get that. But, are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high leverage RWA in a more stressed environment? Have you been selling into this recovery is I guess my question? Jennifer Piepszak : I guess, there is two components to it, which is the Investment Securities portfolio and then proactive things we could do on RWA, if that answers your question. Glenn, I'll start with Investment Securities. We are being cautious. And we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the second quarter. And then, on RWA, we are -- because we're preparing for a range of outcomes, we are spending a lot of time thinking about if we needed to, what could we do? But, it is sort of a last resort because we certainly don't want to have any impact on clients and customers. And so, we're ready -- we're looking at it. But we haven't done anything I would say proactively at this point. We're very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis. Jamie Dimon : So, let me answer this way. On the consumer side, we, like other banks have seen, are kind of prudent tightening with how you do credit. That's already happened. And obviously, you could do some more. But Jen, you had some great numbers about how good credit is. I think, the -- give those FICO\u2019s numbers you gave me the other day. Well, how much better Home Lending is\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : Oh! That was -- that on the LTV, the weighted average LTV. I mean, it's really extraordinary. And I was in mortgage, so I should have remembered, but I did have to ask. And in 2010, our weighted average LTV on the portfolio in Home Lending was 90% and it\u2019s now 56%. Jamie Dimon : And you can assume it's better in credit cards, it's better and auto. We have less subprime. That's a consumer side. On the lending -- on the business side, we've always been prudent. We're always very tight and careful and stuff like that. Usually what happens in downturns like this, you get a little -- more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital. So, a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital. On the investment side, and this is a kind of a peculiarity of accounting again, we can actually make it more conservative, putting securities into help maturity, which we\u2019ve done very little and I'm going to consider -- I don't personally understand why that reduces risk, but it does reduce your SCB. And, maybe we'll do that over time. But, the security portfolios are pretty prudent. There are -- and in trading it's every day. So trading is -- just think of trading is that Daniel, and Troy Rohrbaugh and Jason Sippel and the whole team, they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures. And you could assume that they're managing very, very well and tightly today. And we certainly are not punting for fences or anything like that. We're trying to be very cautious and serve our clients. And so, yes, you are more conservative. And reducing RWA, yes, we can, if we wanted, we could start doing that by all these various things. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. One quickie on the consumer side. I'm curious if you have -- we\u2019re now four months into the bulk of the lockdown in the United States and some of your branches have been either closed or drive-up only, and we're watching your deposits grow like a weed. So, I'm curious if you've learned any lessons that might change your thoughts on the branch network, on your organic growth efforts as we go forward and come out of this someday? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, deposit number -- deposits went up with the PPP. Deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got. Deposits went up -- the revolvers are taken down by $50 billion, something like that. And of course all of that\u2019s already reversed and stuff like that. So, you have to look at both sides of that. But, you were going to say something, Jen? Jennifer Piepszak : I was going to add on -- of course, we're learning a lot. I mean, I mentioned the quick deposit enrollment. But, we haven't learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion. In fact, we just opened our hundredth branch in market expansion. So, we're really excited about that. We think we\u2019ll open probably another 75 this year. So, we'll be nearly halfway to the 400 branches that we talked about in market expansion. And so, we'll see -- we do have -- still have about a 1,000 branches that are closed. And it's possible that we learn something that helps us think about accelerating de-densification or consolidation, but it'll be at the margin. And we're not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior. So, they can really be the ones that inform our strategy. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Charles Peabody : Yes. Good morning. Two questions, one on page six, you give the SLR ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on the capital. I wonder if you had a similar ratio for CET1. And part of that question would also be, which would be the more confined ratio starting next March? Jamie Dimon : There is no temporary relief in CET1. Jennifer Piepszak : Well, CET1, the only -- and I'm not even trying to call it relief. There's a phase in on CET1, but it\u2019s over many years. And so, I don't necessarily think about that as temporary, like SLR. SLR at this point, it is temporary, it is due to expire in the first quarter of next year, which is why we're very-focused on managing that without the exclusions. Jamie Dimon : And they\u2019re both. We manage them both. So, I wouldn't say one is more than the other. We manage something like 20 different capital liquidity ratios. Charles Peabody : And Jamie, FSOC is meeting today behind closed doors. If I understand, there are two topics. One that has to do with secondary mortgage market liquidity and the other with the COVID stress test overlay. Do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those? Jamie Dimon : I don't. The COVID, you could be -- obviously we have some insights. The COVID, obviously we're going to run a new stress test, we\u2019re going to look at all step cases, UW and stuff like that because they laid it out, perfectly reasonable that people would refer to that kind of stress test. I think the mortgage markets is a different issue. Okay? And we've been very consistent that mortgages, believe it or not are more -- far more costly than they should be. Normally, you\u2019d be looking at -- if you looked at the 10-year rate, which is 60 basis points, the mortgage is basically 1.6% or 1.8%, instead of 3.3%. The cost of the reason for that is because the cost of servicing and origination is so high, it's obviously got to be passed through. It\u2019s high because there's enormous amount of rules and regulations put in place that a lot do not create safety and soundness. Safety and soundness is basically 80% LTV, verified people's incomes, make sure you\u2019re doing the right kind of stuff. And the second one is because it's very no securitization market. The securitization market is important because it reduces your risk-weighted asset and puts more incentive for banks to put on your balance sheet. And the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else. So, I think they should change that. They should change it immediately. The beneficiary of that will be non-agency mortgages, which are even more -- a lot more expensive than agency mortgages. So, once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change Reg A, B a little bit that, you have a much better market, the cost of mortgage will come down, and will particularly come down for people that are at the lower end. I mean, so this should be phased and it should be phased right away. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul Martinez : I have a broader question, and I just want to get your perspectives on public policy and banks and a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress testing. And I know banks are working hard to be part of solution this time and not part of the problem. But, we're also having more open discussions about things like inequality and social justice, which, in my opinion, are long overdue. But, I worry that fair or not, banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues. And I think you see that in things like the mainstream press\u2019s depiction of big banks in PPP and stuff like that. And I'm just curious if you are concerned at all about populist anti-bank policies gaining traction, however you want to define them, whether it's breaking up the banks, directed lending, rate capture, or whatever, in a pretty polarized political environment, or do you think I'm being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country? So, just kind of want to get your perspective just generally and how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop. Jamie Dimon : Then thing you got to do every single day when you go to work is to do the right thing for the right reason, serve your customers, and we try to do this. We try very hard to take care of our employees, to train people, we try very hard to advance black lead into the company and finance and others. And of course, we make mistakes. And so, I understand some of the angst out there. But, we try to do the best we can. We get involved in policy, like this mortgage thing, that would be better for Americans. And we understand that people want banks to help America and we do. The most important thing that we can do is be healthy and vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients. And remember, responsible lending is good lending. Irresponsible lending is bad lending. So, very often, we hear that banks should do more of that. No, irresponsible stuff is irresponsible. It will lead to bad outcomes. And that's kind of what happened last time around. So, we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when there's criticism and sometimes -- and often legitimate about what we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the future. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's helpful. I guess as broad as that question was, I am going to ask a very narrow question for Jen and on your NII guidance. I presume that includes gains on PPP fees for unforgiven loans. And have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be? Jennifer Piepszak : So, we've been really clear on PPP, which is that we don't intend to profit from PPP. That doesn't mean that you won't have some geography issues. So you'll have some revenue and then you'll have expenses and the profit will be near zero. It is immaterial amount this quarter, given these fees are recognized over the lives of the loans. So, it's very little this quarter, both revenue and expenses. And looking out, you'll see -- we'll see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter. Again, it will still be zero on the bottom line. And even the gross numbers won't be meaningful in the grand scheme of things. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about? How often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans? And second, you touched on earlier in a question about some of the COVID-related sectors that are being impacted because of what we're going through. Can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that COVID group that you mentioned? Jennifer Piepszak : So, first on that reclassification, we mentioned it was a geography issue in Merchant Services. But, it didn't have to\u2026 Jamie Dimon : There was no reclassification of wholesale loans. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. And then, in terms of the most impacted, I mean, they are the ones that you would expect to see around travel, oil and gas, and real estate and retail. So, it's the sectors that you would expect to see. Although, as I said earlier, and it's important to note that for the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter, less than a third of them were in the most impacted industry. So, really this is -- we're seeing this as being much more broad-based. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. And then second, I may have missed this, so I apologize. But, in your slide 3, you gave a very good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio. Do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate portfolios that loans that might be in forbearance? And is it more commercial real estate or C&I? Jennifer Piepszak : They're just not meaningful numbers. We would have included them, had they been? So, I'll just go back to what we said, which is we're just not seeing what you would typically see. Jamie Dimon : But they end up in non-performing. Jennifer Piepszak : They end up in non-performing. Jamie Dimon : We don't have a category in wholesale or commercial, the same way you have a category in consumer. Operator : And our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the points in slides you made about capital and long-term opportunities for recalibration. First, I guess, will you have any dialogue with the Fed about the 3.3 SCB as some other banks have mentioned? And then, secondly, where do you think we stand on the GSIB recalibration to your points about systemic risk, not that shouldn't impact a bank's balance sheet? Jamie Dimon : We're not going to go back to the Fed and the 3.3%, but obviously we're looking at why 3.3% and we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit. Because we have another CCAR coming up in a couple of months, so there's no reason for us to go through extensive work as opposed to fix what's already there. And GSIB, look, I've always thought GSIB needed a lot of recalibration. But, there are things they should have recalibrated for already, which is America gold plated, which I think is wholly unnecessary. They should have taken cash and treasury and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation. Because obviously it goes way up when the Fed does things like they\u2019re doing recently and they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system, which they were supposed to do. So, I'm just hoping they go about and do that at one point. But these things get so wrapped up in political. People politicize very complicated calculations, which I thought kind of peculiar and funny. But my view is that they do the numbers, they should do them right. And they're just not right anymore. Ken Usdin : Yes. And the second question is just going back to slide three. You lay out the percent of accounts on this page. Auto seems to be the biggest. And then, in the supplement on page 13, the balances seem to imply a bigger percent on deferral. Just can you talk a little bit about the differences there and then why do you think you're seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes? Thank you. Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. I don't actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to slide 3. So, Jason and team can follow up with you on that one. Ken Usdin : Maybe then, just a comment about auto on deferrals and why do you -- what do you think you're seeing in that customer base versus others? And do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends? Jamie Dimon : No. Jennifer Piepszak : No, yes. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : Good morning. Thank you. I guess, I just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising. Dealogic shows over $2 trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter. And I guess, a two-part question around that. One is, as you look at that, was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas, and presumably capital that\u2019s junior to your bank debt? And to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans? And then, secondly, looking forward, I mean, did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the second quarter and therefore, we're looking at kind of the flat spot going forward, or do you see this kind of -- like there's an ongoing need for a lot of these companies continue to raise capital? Jamie Dimon : I think -- first of all, it is across the board. I mean, you saw strong companies, weaker companies, high-yield markets opened up. Converts, I put converts and equity in there too. People did a lot of capital raising. I think, it was wise. I think a lot of people said, they pre-funded a lot of the capital needs to make sure that can get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that. So, I don't think it would be like it was before, so it'll definitely come down, but I still think there's opportunity for some people to pre-fund some of that. But, it is pre-funding because this is not capital -- a lot of this capital's not being raised to go spend. It\u2019s being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that you're prepared for whatever comes next. And you've heard a lot of companies make statements and you guys got to go through yourself about, we\u2019ve got two years of cash, we\u2019ve got three years of cash, we\u2019ve got -- people want to be prepared. I think it's appropriate. Chris Kotowski : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : But just for your models, we don't expect revenues in Investment Banking, they will normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out. At one point, we can't predict month by month exactly, and for trading because no one else, cut it in half, cut it in half. And that will probably be closer to the future than if you say it's going to still be double what it normally runs. Operator : And our next question is from Andrew Lim of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Andrew Lim : Thanks for taking my questions. And I think they are quite straightforward. I just wanted some clarity really on the nature of CECL provisioning. And obviously, you've made some very big provisions based on much more conservative assumptions. But, the nature of CECL provisioning obviously should meant that in the third quarter, if your assumptions do not change, then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second quarter to a much more normal level. I just wanted to see how you thought about that for third quarter? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, I would start by saying where we are right now, while there is a conservative bias to where we are right now, it is our best estimate of what we're facing. We certainly hope that in the future we look back on this as a conservative moment, but this is our best estimate. And so, if our assumptions are realized, and again, our reserve reflects something worse than the base case. So, if that's realized, then we shouldn\u2019t see meaningful reserve builds in the third quarter, or if that continues to be -- in the third quarter. Andrew Lim : So, I mean, context, would it be similar to that we've seen 2019, for example? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. You have reserves for growth but not for the prices. Andrew Lim : Exactly. That\u2019s very clear. And then, on the CIB trading environment, obviously we saw June and we've seen a bit of July. Would you say that's normalized to the level consistent with what we've seen in 2019, or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the second quarter -- sorry, into the third quarter ? Jamie Dimon : I just answered said that question. You should assume it's going to fall in half. We don't know, it\u2019s only a couple weeks into this thing. But we don't assume we have these unbelievable trading results going forward. And hopefully, we'll do better than that. And we simply don't know. I also said one point of reserving since it's probabilistic. You can actually change nothing in your assumptions, but the probabilities of potential outcomes and put up more reserves. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation, which as always, is available on our website. And we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.4 billion, EPS of $2.92, and revenue of $29.9 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Included in these results are $524 million of legal expenses, primarily related to the resolution of legal matters announced last month. Overall for the quarter, while we're still in a very uncertain environment, our underlying business fundamentals performed quite well. So, I'll just touch on a few highlights here before getting into the line-of-business results. The CIB continued its strong performance with IB fees of 9% and markets revenue up 30% year-on-year and we had record revenue in AWM, up 5% year-on-year. On deposits, while we expected to see some normalization in our balances, instead, we saw another quarter of growth, with average deposits up 5% sequentially. And notably, we moved into the Number 1 spot in U.S. retail deposits with 9.8% market share, gaining 50 basis points of share year-on-year. On the other hand, average loans were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily on revolver pay downs from our Wholesale clients. With that, let's turn to Page 2 for more detail on the third-quarter results. We reported revenue of $29.9 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $1.2 billion or 9% on lower rates, partly offset by higher market NII and balance sheet growth. And noninterest revenue was up 1.2 billion or 7%, primarily driven by CIB, including higher banking and markets revenues, as well as net securities gains in corporate.  Expenses of 16.9 billion were up approximately 500 million or 3% year-on-year on the higher legal expenses that I already mentioned. This quarter, credit costs of approximately 600 million were down 900 million year-on-year, primarily driven by modest reserve releases, which you can see in more detail on Page 3. We released approximately 600 million of reserves this quarter, primarily on run-off in Home Lending and changes in Wholesale loan exposure. Charge-offs across our portfolios remain relatively low and, in fact, were down slightly year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. While we could see an uptick in charge-offs over the next few quarters, given payment relief and government stimulus already provided, and we don't expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our updated base case reflects some improvement from last quarter. However, the medium-to-longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus. And so we remain heavily weighted to our downsize scenarios, and with reserves of 33.8 billion, we're prepared for something worse than the base case. And now turning to Page 4, I'll provide a quick update on what we're seeing in our customer assistance programs. You can see here that the vast majority of Card & Auto customers have exited relief, and so what's left in deferral is primarily in Home Lending, including 11 billion of owned loans and 17 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we're seeing with our customers that have exited relief, approximately 90% of accounts remain current. Now, turning to balance sheet and capital on Page 5. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up 60 basis points versus last quarter on earnings generation and lower RWA, partially offset by dividends of $2.8 billion. And it's worth noting that we have over 1.3 trillion of liquidity sources available to us across HQLA and unencumbered securities. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 6. CCB reported net income of $3.9 billion and an ROE of 29%. Revenue of 12.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year driven by deposit margins compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, partially offset by deposit growth and strong Home Lending production margins. Deposit growth was 28% year-on-year, up over 190 billion, largely on lower spending and higher cash buffers across both our consumer and small business customers, as well as organic growth. Client investment assets were up 11% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. Overall, consumer customers are holding up well. They have built savings relative to pre-COVID levels and at the same time, lower debt balances. With regard to digital adoption, early signs suggest the increased customer migration to digital will persist. In fact, nearly 69% of our customers are digitally active, and that's up 3 percentage points year-on-year and accelerating. And quick deposit now represents more than 40% of all check deposits versus 30% pre-COVID. Moving on to consumer lending. Starting with Home Lending, total originations were down 10% year-on-year driven by correspondent. However, consumer volumes were up 46% year-on-year. And notably, more than half of consumer applications were completed digitally, twice the level of the first quarter. In Cards, while our net sales were down 8% year-on-year, spend continued to improve throughout the quarter. And in the month of September, sales were down only 3% year-on-year, reflecting the lowest decline since March. Retail, which is a significant portion of overall spend, was a bright spot, reaching double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, largely driven by card-not-present transactions. And then in Auto, record originations for the quarter of 11.4 billion were up 25% year-on-year. Total CCB loans were down 7% year-on-year, with Home Lending down 15% due to portfolio run-off and Cards down 11% on lower spend, offset by Business Banking, up 83% due PPP loans. Expenses of 6.8 billion were down 4% predominantly due to lower marketing investments. And lastly, credit cost of 794 million included a $300 million reserve release in Home Lending and net charge-offs of 1.1 billion driven by Cards. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 21% on revenue of 11.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of 2.1 billion was up 12% year-on-year and down sequentially off an all-time record quarter, and we maintained our Number 1 rank in IB fees year to date. The quarter's performance was largely driven by our equity capital markets business, which saw an uptick in IPO issuance driven by a strong equity backdrop with stocks trading at or near all-time highs. In advisory, we were down 15% year-on-year, largely impacted by the muted M&A announced volumes in the first half of the year. However, we saw a surge in M&A activity this quarter with announced volumes returning to pre-COVID levels as companies began to shift their focus from day-to-day operations to more strategic and opportunistic thinking.  Debt underwriting fees were also up 5% year-on-year, but down 21% sequentially as we saw investment-grade activity return to more normalized levels from the record volumes we saw in the second quarter. The leveraged finance market continued to recover with high-yield spreads approaching pre-COVID levels and some notable acquisition financing deals closing. We maintained our Number 1 rank in overall wallet, and we're the leaders in lead left across leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were up 42% year-on-year, resulting in the best third quarter ever, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs and follow-on\u2019s. In terms of the outlook, we expect fourth quarter IB fees to be roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year and down sequentially. However, if valuations remain elevated, we could continue to see momentum in capital markets. Moving to markets, total revenue was 6.6 billion, up 30% year-on-year. While activity continued to normalize, with spread, volume and volatility reducing from the elevated levels of the first half of the year, the performance was strong throughout the quarter and across products, reflecting the resilience in earnings power of this franchise through a broad range of market conditions. Fixed income was up 29% year-on-year against a strong third quarter last year driven by a favorable trading environment across products, notably in commodities, as well as elevated client activity in credit and securitized products. Equities was up 32% year-on-year on continued robust client activity in equity derivatives, as well as a recovery in prime balances and a solid performance in cash. Looking forward, it's important to remember that 4Q 2019 performance was very strong, making for a difficult year-on-year comparison. And obviously, forecasting market\u2019s performance remains challenging in this environment. Wholesale Payments revenue of 1.3 billion was down 5% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by balance growth, as well as a reporting reclassification in merchant services. Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was flat year-on-year, where higher deposit balances were offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 5.8 billion were up 5%, compared to the prior year, largely due to higher legal expense, partially offset by lower structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of 2.3 billion was flat year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression, offset by higher balances and fees and higher lending revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of 840 million was up 20% year-on-year on increased debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of 966 million were up 3% year-on-year. Average loans were up 5% year-on-year, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter due to declines in revolver utilization by C&I clients and lower origination volume in CRE. Deposits of 248 billion were up 44% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Finally, our credit costs were a net benefit of 147 million, including a $207 million reserve release and net charge-offs of 60 million. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of 877 million with pre-tax margin of 31% and ROE of 32%. Record revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter was up 5% year-on-year as growth in deposit and loan balances, along with higher management fees and brokerage activity, were largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.6 billion were flat year-on-year, and credit costs were a net benefit of 51 million, primarily due to reserve releases.  For the quarter, net long-term inflows of 34 billion were positive across all channels and driven by fixed income and equity. At the same time, we saw net liquidity outflows of 33 billion. AUM of 2.6 trillion and overall client assets of 3.5 trillion, up 16% and 15% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by net inflows into liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 23% year-on-year, and loans were up 13% with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending. Now on to corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of approximately 700 million. Revenue was a loss of 339 million, down $1 billion year-over-year, driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities, partially offset by 466 million of net securities gains in the quarter. Expenses of 719 million were up 438 million year-on-year, primarily due to an impairment on a legacy investment.  Now let's turn to Page 11 for the outlook. You'll see here that our full year outlook for 2020 remains in-line with what I said at Barclays. We expect net interest income to be approximately 55 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately 66 billion. And while we don't have anything on the page for 2021 and we're not planning to do Investor Day, we'll share more color with you on the outlook in the first quarter of next year.  So, to wrap up, even though recent economic data has been more constructive than we would have expected earlier this year, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. And so we continue to prepare for a broad range of outcomes while focusing on serving our customers, clients and communities through this time. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. So, I think one of the key questions on investors' minds right now is how will banks grow revenue kind of medium-term here as we think about lower-for-longer rates? And I was hoping you could just talk about how you think about managing the company if rates stay very low for a long time and how you can grow revenue. And obviously, year to date, the revenue has been very good, up 4%. And if you could [just reason] the branch expansion that you alluded to in the comments as part of that answer, that would be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, in terms of how we think about the revenue outlook for 2021, first of all, it's early and we'll come back to you in the first quarter with more details, but it is true that if we think about the NII outlook that that will be under pressure relative to 2020 and I can't give more detail on that. But also, we are on pace for record revenue in markets and investment banking, and so that will be a tough compare. Having said that, we're not going to change the way we run the company because of what might be temporary rate headwinds, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base. And with that branch expansion \u2013 we are continuing on our plans in branch expansion. We have, I think, almost a 120 branches open in our expansion markets. We'll do more than another 150 so far this year. We got approval to enter 10 additional states, which we'll ultimately put us in all lower 48. So, we continue with the branch expansion and remain very excited about it with those new branches, in most cases, performing well above the original business case. Jamie Dimon : [Indiscernible] to give you a little bit of longer-term view. There's not one single business or not any bankers, countries, products, digital. We're growing securities services and cash management services. We're adding \u2013 we're growing the Chase wealth management business. We're adding private bankers. We're adding products in Asset Management. And we kind of look through all the things \u2013 I kind of call them the weather. We just keep on growing. The branch expansion is one example of that. We never stopped doing that. We never stopped gaining credit card products. We never stopped growing digital Home Lending products, and we'll be doing that for the next decade. And of course, you have all these ins and out from what I call the weather : NII spreads, margins, markets, etcetera, but the goal is always the same. You grow the business to serve your clients around the world. Matthew O\u2019Connor: And then as a follow-up, Jen, you'd said that you'd elaborate on the net interest income. I don't know if you meant now or you're going to wait until January for that in terms of the outlook for next year, just some puts and takes. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So there, I had said at Barclays that the current run rate was a good place to start. So 13 billion is a good place to start and for 2021 reflects the impact of the rate environment and some normalization in market's NII. But from there, balance sheet growth and mix should be supportive throughout the year. And so for the full-year of 2021, my best view at this point would be 53 billion, plus or minus. But yes, we'll sharpen our pencils on that and continue to provide updates. But right now, full year, 53 billion. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, I guess the reserve release was definitely driven by mortgage prepay and run-offs, I get that. But NPAs were still up 18% quarter-on-quarter. I wonder if you could talk about what drove that. Maybe comment on commercial real estate specifically. It'd be appreciated. Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, the reserve release, as you said, was largely on portfolio run-off and changes in exposure in Wholesale, so not a reflection of a change in our outlook. And then the increase in nonaccrual loans is \u2013 on the consumer side is mortgage, and it represents the customers that have come out of forbearance and are not paying. And so as you saw on that slide, the payment deferral slide, about 90% are still current. The other 10% has now been reflected in the nonaccrual exposure. So that is all mortgage. And then the increase in nonaccrual on the wholesale side was just a few name-specific downgrades, which are in sectors you would expect, as you just said, retail-related real estate and oil and gas. And then more broadly on commercial real estate, I'll just share that we feel adequate reserve for what we're facing. But if you look at rent collection as an example overall, with the exception of retail, between 85% and 95%. And then even retail in the month of September was about 80% \u2013 has recovered to about 80%. So still a lot of uncertainty there, but we feel adequately reserved. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe one on asset management, you have been doing great. I don't need to ask on your specific business, but in the past, you've spoken about potential interest in participating in industry consolidation. We saw some of that happening lately. Can you just talk \u2013 remind us about the parameters of what you would and might not be interested in doing in asset and wealth management? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Well, since we have you all on the line, our doors and our telephone lines are wide open. We would be very interested, and we do think you will see consolidation in the business, but we're not going to be more specific than that. [Indiscernible] product-sensitive, the systems, the technology, the business projects, the ability to execute, there's lot \u2013 there are a lot of issues that will determine whether something makes sense for us in there. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Hey, Jen and Jamie, that was some comment. You said you do not expect much higher charge-offs until the second half of next year, and that's even with the higher NPAs. So what are your assumptions behind that, Jen, as far as specifically when the forbearance actions run their course? And, Jamie, policy actions that might be embedded in that expectation? Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. So I'll just start, Mike, with, first of all, the increase in nonaccrual was on mortgage. And when you look at the LTV on those \u2013 the loan to value on those loans, that's what is embedded into how we're thinking about the \u2013 what charge-offs will look like in the near term. There's still very healthy LTVs on those loans. So really, when we talk about losses really emerging in a significant way, not until the back half of 2021, we're talking about cards. And just given the amount of stimulus and payment relief and just support in the system, we haven't seen the delinquency buckets begin to fill up, and we charge 180 days past due in cards. So that is primarily just a timing issue as it relates to cards. We could see increases in charge-offs in the next few quarters on the wholesale side or maybe here and there on the consumer side. It's just that the meaningful change in charge-offs, we don't expect until the second half of 2021. Jamie Dimon : Yes. And, Mike, about policy, first of all, I wouldn't say that policy is determinative here because this is unprecedented times. And what we're saying is that policy will matter and will skew the odds [indiscernible] better outcome. So, I think the policy \u2013 obviously, the Fed is doing what it can to keep markets open, but the policy on the fiscal side is just some kind of continuation of unemployment insurance and PPP. So, those are the two most vulnerable areas to just maximize the chance that we'll have better outcomes and I do think that over time, intelligent return to work. I caution people \u2013 remember, 100 million people go to work every day. So the complete focus is on the 50 million who don't go to work. But the 100 million who go to work, it's rather safe. There's a lot of examples where you do the social distancing and the cleaning and all the various things like that, that it may be safer than being home in your community. And so \u2013 but the getting back to work is a little bit important because you look at cities and travel and a whole bunch of stuff. There are a lot of people who are under a lot of stress and strain who won't be able to survive another year of complete closedown. So, the other policy is numerous, rational, thoughtful return to the office, done properly, which will help all those businesses support the big office towers and buildings and stuff like that. And those two things will maximize the chance of good outcome. They don't guarantee the chance of a good outcome. Mike Mayo : And I know this is a tough question, but you're in the middle of the stress test part two. When all is said and done, Jamie or Jen, where do you think these charge-offs go as a percentage of the global financial crisis? You have to have \u2013 I know you have scenarios, but where should we think \u2013 is it like half the GFC level, same as GFC level, twice the GFC level? What are you guys thinking at the back of your mind? Jennifer Piepszak : It's a very difficult question to answer. It's very different, of course, because the GFC was heavily mortgage-related, and this will probably be less so. We also \u2013 our portfolios are in significantly better shape coming into this, whether it's mortgage or card. But just given the amount of uncertainty about where this could go, we still have 12 million people unemployed, I think it's very difficult. I don't know, Jamie, whether you would add. Jamie Dimon : It's very hard \u2013 I agree with you, Jen. It's very hard to say. And, Mike, it depends on the outcome. Again, we look at the good case, the medium case, the relative adverse case and the extreme adverse case. And there, the answers are completely different, and we don't know the future. So it's hard to predict what it's going to be. But our reserves are prepared for relative to the adverse case, which is equal to the \u2013 roughly equivalent to CCAR extreme adverse case that we just got, roughly. Again, it\u2019s very hard to compare apples-to-apples in these things. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I'm going to ask the two questions that I often get from investors that are hesitant to dip their toe back into bank stocks. And the first is \u2013 and Jen, this goes back to your earlier comment. The one question I get on credit quality is did stimulus and policy redefine cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle? In other words, I think Jamie said changed the outcome or do you think it just delayed the realization of these losses? Jennifer Piepszak : So, I think it's difficult to know. I think the purpose of it was to change the outcome, not just delay the losses. But it's difficult to know. People sort of described it as a bridge, and the question is whether the bridge will be long enough and strong enough to bridge people back to employment and bridge small businesses back to normalcy. So, I think it remains to be seen. As Jamie said, we're obviously preparing for it to not necessarily change the outcome, obviously, because we built significant reserves. So, we're prepared for it to be a delay rather than change the outcome. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question, and perhaps if I could direct this to Jamie. This is a bit of a follow-up to Matt's earlier question, but investors are essentially worried on the other side of the credit recovery about what the interest rate environment may imply for \"normalized ROTCE.\" And as you think about what you mentioned to be \"weather considerations,\" what prevents JP Morgan from going back to that 17%, 19% ROTCE that you posted in [2018 and 2019]? Jamie Dimon : Well, you guys know that's a forecast of the future. It's hard to tell. I think negative interest rates are a bad idea and will probably force, over time, the banking industry to strength, which means they'd be buying back stock and doing other things with their capital. But we're able to handle low rates, and we can have decent returns at low rates. I think it's a bad long-term strategy. I also think it's a bad idea for you all to assume they're going to continue like that forever. I mean we had massive global QE in the last go around, and we didn't have inflation. So, I remind people, a lot of that QE was around Fed. The Fed and the central banks support securities so that would create deposits to banks. The banks support to put deposits in the central banks. So it was not new inflationary fiscal stimulus. Fiscal stimulus, which has been extraordinary around the world is by its nature, inflationary. And so we don't really know the outcome of that. But my view, and what I tell investors, we're going to build our businesses day in and day out regardless of interest rate environments, etc., and we have plans to adjust interest rate environments. We cannot do certain things. We can charge for certain things. We can do a whole bunch of different stuff. But the services is still required, moving money around the world, trading for people, underwriting securities, helping manage their money, and we'll be Okay. We'll work through it. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I had two questions. One was be interested in understanding how you are threading the needle between your outlook here for reserve and the potential to buy back stock. You've got the reserve level high with a base case outlook for unemployment that's above where we are today for the next six months, it looks like, or even longer. And your capital build is obviously continuing to increase here. So, how should we think about that? Could we imagine that your buyback could kick off before reserve release happens? And would you release reserves before the net charge-offs start to come through, like you mentioned, in second half 2021? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So as we \u2013 first of all, on stock buybacks, obviously, we are restricted here in the fourth quarter. We are hopeful that the Fed will see what they need and get what they need in the resubmission to give them the confidence to revert to a more normal distribution framework under SCB in the first quarter. So, that's obviously the most important hurdle for us. And then if we have excess capital \u2013 and the reserve decision and the buyback decision are not related to one another, we are always going to make sure that we have our best estimate of losses that we're facing considering the uncertainty as well. And then, of course, our capital hierarchy would always look to grow our businesses, first and foremost. But if we have excess capital and if we do not have regulatory restrictions, you could see us buy back stock as early as the first quarter. And like I said, that wouldn't necessarily be related to a reserve release. The other thing on potential reserve releases, we obviously need to see the economy continue to deliver on the base case to give us the confidence that, that is what we're dealing with. But I would just say that, remember there was a capital release \u2013 a partial capital release on CECL builds. So, when you release reserves, only about half of that actually falls through to capital. Betsy Graseck : And could you talk a little \u2013 Jen, could you talk a little bit about the Slide 3 where you've got the base case outlook for unemployment? And just give us a sense as to what's driving this base case outlook for unemployment in 4Q 2020 at 9.5% and then 2Q 2021 at 8.5%? They're obviously above where we are today. And could you help us understand how you're thinking about flexing that going forward? What would change those assumptions? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. That's like largely, Betsy, a timing issue with when we actually run the models for the reserve. That's not necessarily, as you rightly point out, reflective of our autonomous latest outlook. So, we would, as we progress through the fourth quarter, use the latest outlook for the base case. But then again, as Jamie said, we look at a number of different scenarios. And depending upon what we think we're dealing with in terms of the uncertainty, we may continue to heavily weight the downside scenarios or maybe even more heavily weight the downside scenarios. We have to see. So, if you look at the weighted outcome of all of the scenarios that we use to derive the reserves, it is \u2013 we are prepared for a double-digit unemployment, peak unemployment level. But it would now start with the revised base case, shall I say, from our comments. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Kind of just put into perspective just a little bit, the capital. I mean we have extraordinary amounts of capital, $200 billion. We've got 1.3 trillion of liquid assets and securities. And the way you should look at it is the 200 billion in just next eight quarters will earn PPNR like pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of roughly $80 billion, give or take. We don't know exactly what that's going to be. So with that 80 billion, if things get better, it will be more than that, and we take down reserves. If it didn't get worse, it may be about that. All the worse than that, we have to put up 20 billion. Even if you put up the 20 billion, in my view, that won't emerge in a quarter. That will emerge over several quarters, which also means you can buy \u2013 pay the dividend, buy back stock, have plenty of capital and still be very conservatively capitalized. And that's the reality of it. Okay. [Forget] all the other stuff you read. And we're conservative. We like to be conservative regarding loan loss reserves and capital. So, we'll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes. And I hope we're allowed to do it too before the stock is much higher. Jennifer Piepszak : And the 20 billion that Jamie referenced, as we talked about the extreme adverse scenario last quarter. So, you can think that that's the 20 billion that Jamie is referencing, if that is what\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Yes. And that 20 billion is unemployment of 12%, 13% that goes off into the better part of six quarters. I mean it's really extremely adverse. It's far worse than the CCAR case we just got. Operator : Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Good morning. Jen, you mentioned that next year, you have some tough revenue comps. Can you talk about the notion of expense flexibility at JP Morgan? Underneath the surface of flattish expenses, where are you on saving money from digitization and structural change? And how does that give you flexibility against where you'd like to be investing? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, first of all, it's early. We're still working through next year. So, I will certainly refine the guidance in the first quarter. But as it relates to expenses, we will \u2013 and you mentioned digital, that's one. We will continue to deliver on our structural expense efficiencies as we have been for the last several years. There will \u2013 as we do expect the world to normalize a bit, there will be opportunity in volume and revenue-related expenses, but we're going to continue to invest. And so there will be puts and takes, and we'll just provide you more detailed guidance in the first quarter. John McDonald : Okay. And as a follow-up, on capital, can you talk about the notion of reducing your SCB and maybe your GSIB surcharge footprint over time? I think you\u2019ve commented that there's potential to do that. What is the path and the route to doing that? And how do you feel about the prospects for those two things getting better over time? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, I'll start with GSIB, which is that we do expect to be in the 4% bucket at the end of this year, but it is not effective immediately. And so we will have 2021 to manage that back down. What I would say there is that with the Fed balance sheet at these levels possibly expanding that makes managing the GSIB back down quite challenging. So, in the absence of recalibration, which we remain hopeful about, managing that back down will certainly be challenging, but not impossible, but we'll really certainly think about any impact on our client franchise before we do anything. So, we have some time there. We could see recalibration that would help, but no doubt that, that's a challenge. On SCB, I'd start by saying it's scenario-dependent, of course. So, all else equal, we do think that we have opportunities to manage down the SCB, and so that can include transferring securities from AFS to held to maturity and then some other mechanical issues on our side that we're confident will now, all things equal, reduce our SCB. But again, it's scenario-dependent. So all that being said, John, I would just say that our expectation at this point over time is that our target capital level of 11.5% to 12% should be unchanged over time. John McDonald : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Jen, Jamie mentioned earlier that you've got 1.3 trillion of cash and securities. It didn't look like you really changed the size of the investments portfolio this quarter, but you did make a bunch of moves into held to maturity from available for sale. And I'm just wondering, you guys have talked about expectation that deposits might settle down, but they're continuing to grow. And so what can you do at this point and going forward with the move \u2013 starting to move some of that cash into things that might at least earn some more to protect the NII going forward? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, I'll talk\u2026 Jamie Dimon : So, Jen, I just want to say that we're not going to do anything to protect the NII. We have $300 billion of cash we can invest today, and that becomes 400 billion. We're not going to invest it in stuff making 50, 60 or 70 basis points, so we get to see a teeny little bit more of NII. But we're going to make long-term decisions for the company. And if your NII gets squeezed a little bit, so be it. But we don't want to be in a position where we lose a lot of money because you may invest in some 5-year or 10-year securities, which you'll lose a lot if rates go up. So, we're not protecting NII. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. So, as a principal matter, it's important to remember that we manage the portfolio across multiple dimensions, not just optimizing NII, as Jamie said. And we're thinking about capital protection at these levels. But just in terms of the activity that you saw in the securities portfolio, we've been very active. We added about 160 billion through now the end of Q2. In Q3, we were active buyers and sellers because in Q3, we saw attractive selling opportunities, which made economic sense for us. So, just to Jamie's point, so you give up some NII, but it just made economic sense for us, but we have \u2013 we were also buying in the third quarter. We also focused on optimizing liabilities with the excess liquidity. So, you'll see that our debt is down nearly 40 billion from last quarter. So then just in terms of the transfer to held to maturity with the significant growth in securities portfolio, it just made sense from a capital protection perspective. And it's also helpful for SCB as I mentioned, and these were high-quality core holdings. Ken Usdin : Yes. I fully agree on that duration point, Jamie. A follow-up just on \u2013 if you think about the fee businesses and some of the\u2026 Jamie Dimon : You guys should also be raising the question about why moving some of the held to maturity, reducing SCB? Like that is a rational thing, which I don't think it is. But that's what it is and that's what we're going to deal with. It's why we can drive down SCB. Ken Usdin : Yes. Jennifer Piepszak : On duration, with the 10-year has backed up a bit over the last couple of weeks, and so we have been \u2013 we'll remain opportunistic, but we have added at these levels. Ken Usdin : Great. And then just one follow-up on just fees in general, you've got the consumer fee businesses that are still trying to get back to where they were a year ago. And then last quarter, Jamie had made the comment about cut it in half and trading, and it wasn't anywhere close to that, which was positive. It's still quite, quite good. And how you think through just the pushes and pulls between fees as you look forward, right, in terms of how much better do you think the consumer can get from where it is? So, how much, if any, are the institutional businesses over-earning relative to where they posted in the first half? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So on consumer fees, you'll see that consumer fees recovered a bit in the third quarter. The decline there was both release actions that we took, but also because of the higher cash buffers that consumers are experiencing that also impacts fees. And so \u2013 and that's a good thing, so we'll take that. So that did recover a bit in the third quarter, but that will take time to get back to what you might consider normalized levels. And then on the institutional side, we did expect to see markets normalize in the third quarter. We did see that a bit, but not as much as we had thought when we were at second quarter earnings. And IB fees also continued to be very strong in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations for what we might have thought in the second quarter. Looking forward, though, the fourth quarter is a tough compare. So, we do \u2013 and we do expect markets to continue to normalize. And then on the IB fee side, our pipeline is flattish to what it was last year. It's just still down a bit in M&A, but we did see M&A recover in the third quarter, and it's up in ECM. So, as I said, flattish in the fourth quarter feels about right at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So, Jen, I was hoping you could speak to the expectations for loan growth across both the institutional and consumer channels. When do you anticipate we could begin to see balances quite positively? And separately, just what level of loan growth is contemplated in the 53 billion NII guide that you provided for 2021? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So loan growth will be challenged, I think, for \u2013 in the short-term. On the wholesale side, I think we'll probably tread water at these levels, but increasing CEO confidence with M&A activity and capital investment should be supportive of more normalized loan growth, but that may take some time. On the consumer side, we are seeing cards continue to revert to more normal levels. And so that will continue into 2021, but that could be offset by continued prepays in the mortgage. So there will be puts and takes there. And then asset management, I think we'll continue to see solid growth. So net-net, not significant loan growth, but the mix will be helpful because of the card growth is supportive of a mix benefit on NII. Steve Chubak : Thanks for that and maybe a question for you, Jamie. You had alluded to potential for charging for additional products and services to offset rate pressures. And I was hoping you could speak to some of the areas where you might look to potentially charge clients. So just philosophically, how you're handicapping the risk of client attrition if competitors ultimately don't follow suit. Jamie Dimon : There is \u2013 first of all, I don't think it's going to happen, so I don't spend too much time worrying about it. But we have, as a company matter, gone through everything we do and how we do it and how we respond to negative rates. I'm not going through account by account. But like I said, while these are necessary services, all the competitors \u2013 it's a competitive world, I agree with you. If competitors don't do stuff, you have a hard time doing it. But I think that you will see a lot of competitors respond to negative rates in a lot of different ways. So there will be an opportunity and something like that. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a question on deposit growth, I think we've all been surprised at the continued growth. Can you just kind of talk to what you're seeing? It looked like we had further growth in September. Are you expecting this to continue? Is it sort of moving out of money markets into deposits? What do you think is driving the growth? And do you expect it to continue? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, there's no doubt that with the Fed being this active that there is significant excess liquidity in the system. We did think that we would see deposits normalized in the third quarter, both on consumer spending on the consumer side and then on just the wholesale side in places like security services, with asset managers holding cash on the sidelines. We didn't what we thought we would. So yes, we did continue to see deposit growth here in the third quarter. Going forward, I think that normalization is still just very much a part of our outlook except for that. Given that the normalization is a bit deferred here, it will likely be offset by the continued organic growth, perhaps more than offset by continued organic growth. Jim Mitchell : Right. Makes sense. And then maybe a follow-up on credit. I mean I appreciate that we're not going to see charge-offs given where delinquencies are today. But what do you think \u2013 how do we think about delinquencies and what triggers you to either release or build reserves? I would imagine that we'll see it \u2013 you would be making those decisions before charge-offs. Where do we see delinquencies? You've had very good experience so far in your core book as well as the deferrals acting well. When do we \u2013 are we \u2013 I mean it just seems very surprising that we haven't seen delinquencies tick up yet in any material way. When do you expect that or is it really all dependent on sort of the goodwill of the government? Jennifer Piepszak : Well, I think we \u2013 one of the reasons we haven't seen delinquencies tick up is because of the payment relief, but also the extraordinary support that has been provided through stimulus. So we'll probably see delinquencies tick up in the early part of 2021. We're not assuming further stimulus beyond the end of this year and how we think about reserves. So, we do think you'll start to see delinquencies tick up early 2021 and then charge-offs in the back half of 2021. I think future stimulus would give us more confidence in the economy delivering on the base case. There's just a lot of factors that we'll be looking at as we think about the right level of our reserves over the coming quarters, and delinquencies will be just one part of that. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : I may have missed this, I had to jump off for a minute on the call, but can you give us some color as you've spoken very well about what's going on in the consumer credit area, but when you go into the commercial side of the business, can you share what the sectors that you're seeing the biggest challenges? And can you give us some color on the rerating process that you're going through on those credits that are in trouble today and what kind of deterioration you're seeing in those specific credits in terms of possibly write-downs or revaluations or if it's collateral, like in a commercial real estate loan? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, the sectors, I think, are ones that you would expect airlines, lodging, restaurants, other T&E, real estate, oil and gas. And those continue to be the sectors under the most pressure. When you look at downgrades here in the third quarter or \u2013 not here in the third quarter \u2013 in the third quarter, we saw downgrades slow a bit because in the second quarter, we saw significant downgrades just on the increased level of debt that companies were taking on. So we saw downgrades slow a bit in the third quarter, but we do expect downgrades to continue, particularly in real estate. And then elsewhere, in wholesale, I would say, CEO sentiment is guarded, but constructive. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know you \u2013 Jamie touched on interest rates and how you're very focused in growing your business in any rate environment. Could you give us some color, inflation, if it does pick up and if we get a steepening in the curve? Obviously, Chairman Powell has indicated he is not going to move on rates for quite some time, but if we're looking in your third quarter of, let's say, 2021 and then 10-year government bond yield is, let's say, the 125 basis points, can you just give us some color? I know that's not your prediction, but what would that do for the margin in revenues if we were fortunate enough now to see a steeper curve due to higher inflation? Jennifer Piepszak : It's a great number. I don't have the sensitivity to hand if it would be \u2013 go ahead, Jamie. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I'd tell you, there's a disclosure we make in the 10-Q, it shows what would happen if rates go up 100 basis points. I forgot the number, Jen, isn't like, I'm going to say, $2.5 billion a year, with the rolls and as a piece of that, but the smaller piece. The rolls \u2013 and that rolls in and compounds over time. But that's not the right way to look at it. You have to ask the why. If you have an active environment, rates are going up; we're going to have more volume and more NII. If you have stagflation, by a big chance, that's a really bad idea. So, the why is more important than just the what here. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS. Saul, your line is open. Please proceed. Saul Martinez : Hello? Sorry about that, I was on mute. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question, I think it was from Ken on \u2013 probably sales and trading. But you're tracking this year in sales and trading to a revenue of close to $30 billion, and if we go back to, say, 2010, shortly after the crisis, it's been pretty consistently the annual revenues in, say, the $18 billion to $21 billion range. There was obviously a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis, but it's generally been in that range. So, how do we think about, or frame the range of outcomes as market conditions normalize? Do you feel like there have been changes in terms of either share or market structure that maybe allow you to have a larger revenue base than the \u2013 and more revenues from those businesses than you have had historically even as market conditions normalize or is it just kind of too hard to tell? I'm just trying to think through because it obviously has a pretty big impact on your overall PPNR and revenue forecast going forward. Jennifer Piepszak : I think that \u2013 I mean as you know, we're on pace for a record year. So, I think any compares are going to be challenging, and we do expect the market to continue to normalize. And that could be partially offset by share gains as you mentioned, but it is never a good idea to try to forecast market even early in the quarter, never mind the year before. I don't know, Jamie, do you want to add anything? Jamie Dimon : I'd say, look, this is a ground working. We got a lot of tough competitors, and we're all building systems and stuff like that. They can do a better job to that. Almost impossible to forecast short-term numbers in that. Saul Martinez : Yes. No \u2013 and I understand that. I totally get that and appreciate that. It's just that you're kind of tracking to a revenue that's about 50% higher than what you've done in the post \u2013 any year in the post-crisis environment or to that, somewhere to that effect. So just that delta between the current run rate and what has been a more normalized run rate is pretty sizable. So, I'm just trying to get any color in terms of kind of thinking through kind of a range of outcomes for just where that could settle in, and not necessarily in a given quarter, per se, but just more on a normalized base as you think about the business as a whole. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, I'd say our trader did \u2013 have done an exceptional job, but I would say the second quarter will not be typical and the third quarter probably won't. Hopefully, it might be better than what it's been in the past couple of years, but we don't know. But remember, the market itself, total bonds, total assets under management, total credit cards, total mortgage products, total global products, that's growing over time. So there is an underlying growth as we spread, we sell them around, our competition moves around. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim of Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, you've got 33.8 billion of reserves. I guess that's in line with an extreme adverse scenario. I know you can't tell what's going to happen going forward given these many different variables, but we've already seen some of that being released. So, I was wondering if we had the base case scenario pan out over the coming years, how much of that 33.8 billion should we expect to be released back through the P&L and over what time period? Jennifer Piepszak : So I'll start by saying we're not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. So, we are reserved for something worse than the base case because we have put heavy weight on scenarios that are worse than the base case, but we are not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario. And the release this quarter was, first of all, very small in the grand scheme of things and was almost exclusively related to portfolio runoff or the exposure changes, and not anything to do with the change in our outlook. And then if the economy delivers the base case, you will see reserve releases from us in coming quarters, but it is very, very difficult to try to tell you how much and when. Andrew Lim : I mean surely, you've got like \u2013 you can make like an estimate of your reserves if you did assume the base case going forward. And I guess, it's the difference between what you are \u2026 Jamie Dimon : I've already said that the base case \u2013 if the Fed base case happens, there's probably something like $10 billion of reserve. Andrew Lim : $10 billion over reserved? Jamie Dimon : Over reserved, if that happens. Andrew Lim : [Indiscernible] Jamie Dimon : No, no. $10 billion over reserved. Andrew Lim : Got it. Understood. Jennifer Piepszak : And I mentioned it earlier, it's just important to remember that there were capital modifications to CECL. So, only about half of that ends up in capital, because as you release your reserves \u2026 Andrew Lim : Yes, of course. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Andrew Lim : Got it. Understood. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up question on your CET1 ratio, you had a nice pickup there this quarter. Obviously, you've had strong earnings, but you've also had a near 2% reduction in risk-weighted assets. I'm just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the moving parts there and how you expect that to pan out in the coming quarters. Jennifer Piepszak : That's largely \u2013 the RWA reduction was largely on revolver pay downs. So, I wouldn't expect that kind of pace to continue. We will continue to bill if we're not allowed to buy back stock, but we will continue to build capital on earnings, so probably less so on RWA reduction. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Charles Peabody : Yes. Good morning. A question about your rate sensitivity to the long-end, if I look at a time series going back to the second quarter of last year, your rate sensitivity has increased every single quarter to a steepening yield curve. In other words, your NII would improve for more than the yield curve steepened at the long-end. So my question is, was that an intended action or residual effect? Because I did notice that you've been adding fairly significantly to your MBS portfolio. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. So Charles, I don't know precisely the answer to that, but it's largely going to be, I'm assuming, on the growth in our deposit base, which then has supported the growth in the securities portfolio. Charles Peabody : Okay. It's substantial. I mean, if you go back to the second quarter of last year, you had a $600 million potential increase, and second quarter of this year was $1.7 billion. Anyway, my second question is related to the legacy impairment charge, can you give us some color around that, what sort of asset class that was in? And is it over half a billion, under half a billion? Jennifer Piepszak : So, under half a billion of what remains, and it was a legacy investment that we took an impairment on, and it's not meaningful in the grand scheme of things. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Just a quick question to start with, maybe as you think about kind of what you've been doing for a customer accommodation. As it relates to the pandemic, I know there would have been fee waivers first quarter, second quarter of this year. But what kind of customer accommodation was happening in the third quarter? Is it kind of a clean number from a fees perspective in the third quarter or is there still a certain level of accommodation going on? Jennifer Piepszak : There is probably \u2013 I don't actually know. Jason and team can get you the detail. It's less than what it was in the second quarter, and it's more \u2013 the \u2013 what we mean in terms of the reduction in fees is more a function of cash buffers. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then is there a way that you can give an update on the IB pipeline, but on a geographic basis? I mean as we've seen negative highlights around COVID kind of around the world, is there different pipelines building in different regions? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : There's less of a regional story. But from a product perspective, overall, we're flattish to last year, but M&A is a little bit lower. Importantly though, we're covered quite nicely in the third quarter, and ECM is a little bit higher, but overall flattish. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live for the presentation. Please standby.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back. It\u2019s slightly longer this quarter, given we are not having Investor Day, and so after I review our results, I will spend some time on our outlook for 2021 as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us. So starting on page one for the fourth quarter. The firm reported net income of $12.1 billion, EPS of $3.79 on revenue of $13.2 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 24%. Included in these results are approximately $3 billion of credit reserve releases. Before we get into more detail on our performance, I will just touch on a few highlights. First off, our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far. We saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to 9.2%. In CIB markets, revenue was up 20% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter. And in AWM, we had record revenue of 10% year-on-year. On deposits, we saw another quarter of strong growth, up 35% year-on-year and 6%, sequentially as Fed balance sheet expansion continues to increase the overall amount of cash in the system, while loan growth remained muted up 1% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. On to page two for more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $30.2 billion was up $1 billion or 3% year-on-year. Net interest income was down approximately $900 million or 7%, primarily driven by lower rates and mix partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher market NII. Non-interest revenue was up $1.9 billion or 13% on higher IB fees, legacy investment gains in corporate, and higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $16 billion were down 2% year-on-year on lower volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by continued investments. Credit costs were a net benefit of $1.9 billion, down $3.3 billion year-on-year, primarily driven by reserve releases of $2.9 billion that I will cover in more detail shortly. Turning to the full year results on page three. The firm reported net income of $29.1 billion, EPS of $8.88 on record revenue of nearly $123 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 14%. Revenue was up $4.5 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was down $2.8 billion or 5% on lower rates, partly offset by higher markets NII and balance sheet growth, and non-interest revenue was up $7.3 billion or 12% on higher markets and IB fees, as well as higher production revenue in home lending. Expenses of $66.7 billion were up 2% year-on-year driven by volume and revenue-related expenses, higher legal and continued investments, partially offset by lower structural expenses. And credit costs were $17.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve bill of $12.2 billion due to the impacts of COVID-19 and net charge offs that were down year-on-year. Now turning to reserves on page four. We released approximately $3 billion of reserves this quarter across Wholesale and Home Lending. Starting with Wholesale, we released $2 billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity. In Home Lending, we released $900 million primarily on improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent to portfolio run-off. And in Card, we held reserves flat as we remain cautious about the near-term, especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times pre-pandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits. And so, with the near-term outlook still quite uncertain, we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios, and at nearly $31 billion we are reserved at approximately $9 billion above the current base case. And to touch on net charge-offs for the quarter, they were down about $450 million year-on-year and remain relatively low across our portfolios. Looking forward, we still don\u2019t expect any meaningful increases in charge-offs until the second half of 2021; and with the recent stimulus, it could be even later. Turning to page five. We have included here an update on our customer assistance programs and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers. The vast majority of what\u2019s left in deferral is in mortgage with $10 billion of own loans and $13 billion in our service portfolio. And in terms of what we are seeing from our customers that have exited relief, more than 90% of accounts remain current. Turning to balance sheet and capital on page six. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation largely offset by dividends of $2.8 billion and higher RWA. As we stated in our press release last month, the Board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our Fed authorized capacity of $4.5 billion after paying our $0.90 dividend. You can see here on the page, we\u2019ve have included the liquidity coverage ratio for both the firm and the bank, which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheets. The firm is at a healthy LCR of 110%; however, the bank LCR is 160% reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand. Now let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page seven. In the fourth quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32%. Revenue of $12.7 billion was down 8% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower Card NII on lower balances, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher Home Lending production revenue. Deposit growth was 30% year-on-year, up over $200 billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepen primary relationships. Loans were down 6% year-on-year with Home Lending down due to portfolio run-off and Card down on lower spend offset by Business Banking, which was up due to PPP loans. Client investment assets were up 17% year-on-year driven by both net inflows and market performance. On spend, combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up 1% year-on-year, which reflected debit sales up 12%, largely driven by retail and everyday spend, and credit sales down 4% largely driven by T&E. In Home lending, overall production margins remained strong. Total originations were down 2% year-on-year but were up 12% quarter-on-quarter both driven by correspondent as we lean into the channel after pulling back earlier in the year. For the year, total originations were $114 billion, including nearly $73 billion of consumer originations, both the highest since 2013. In auto, loan and lease origination volume was $11 billion up 29% year-on-year. And across the franchise, digital engagement continues to accelerate. Our customers use credit deposit for more than 40% of all check deposits, which is nearly 10 percentage points higher than a year ago. And in Home Lending nearly two-thirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using Chase My Home and that has tripled since the first quarter. Over 69% -- overall, 69% of our customers are digitally active with Business Banking at 86%, both higher than a year ago. Expenses of $7 billion were down 1% year-on-year and credit cards for a net benefit of $83 million driven by $900 million of reserve releases in Home Lending largely offset by net charge offs in Cards of $767 million. Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on page eight. CIB reported net income of $5.3 billion and an ROI of 26% on revenue of $11.4 billion for the fourth quarter and an ROI of 20% on revenue of $49 billion for the full year. The extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year. In Investment Banking, IB fees were up 25% for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade. For the quarter, Investment Banking revenue of $2.5 billion was up 37% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. The quarter\u2019s performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market, as well as strong performances in DECM and M&A. In advisory we were up 19% year-on-year driven by the closing of several large transactions. The M&A market continued to strengthen this quarter and in fact announced volumes exceeded pre-COVID levels. Debt underwriting fees were up 23% year-on-year, driven by leveraged finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall. In equity underwriting fees were up at 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by our strong performance and follow ups in IPOs. Looking forward, we expect IB fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust. We expect M&A to remain active on improves overall CEO confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue, of course dependent on a successful containment COVID. Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year against a record fourth quarter last year. Fixed income was up 15% year-on-year, driven by good client activity across businesses, particularly in spread products, as well as a favorable trading environment in currencies and emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equities was up 32% year-on-year, driven by strong client activity and equity derivatives and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and March episodic transactions. Looking forward, we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of January, but it\u2019s obviously too early to predict the full quarter. And for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year, the comparisons will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in 2020. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the reporting reclassification in merchant services and security services revenue of $1.1 billion was down 1% year-on-year. On a full year basis, the headwinds from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth. Expenses of $4.9 billion were down 9% compared to the prior year, driven by lower compensation and legal expenses. Now let\u2019s go to Commercial Banking on page nine. Commercial Banking reported net income of $2 billion and an ROI of 36%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year with higher lending and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Records gross Investment Banking revenue of $971 million was up 53% year-on-year. And the full year was also record finishing at $3.3 billion surpassing our previously established $3 billion long-term target and given our investments in bank recovery, we believe there\u2019s continued upside from here. Expenses of $950 million were flat year-on-year. Deposits of $277 billion were up 52% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. Average loans were up 1% year-on-year, but down 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% on lower revolver balances, with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continued to access capital markets for liquidity and CRE loans were down 1% on higher prepayment activity in both CTL and Real Estate Banking. Finally, credit cards were a net benefit of $1.2 billion driven by reserve releases. Now on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 10. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $786 million with pretax margin and ROI of 29%. And for the year, AWM generated record net income of $3 billion with pretax margin and ROI of 28%. For the quarter, revenue of $3.9 billion was up 10% year-on-year, as higher performance and management fees, as well as growth and deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.8 billion were 13% year-on-year, primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced. But excluding this, expenses would have been up 4% year-on-year on volume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $33 billion positive across all channels, asset classes and regions and this was true of the $92 billion for the full year as well. In liquidity, we saw net outflows of $36 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $104 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.7 trillion, up 17% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, was driven by net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products, as well as higher market levels. And finally, deposits were up 31% year-on-year and loans were up 15%, as clients continue to increase their liquidity in both for investment opportunities. Now on the Corporate on page 11. Corporate reported net loss of $358 million. Revenue was a loss of approximately $250 million relatively flat year-on-year. Net interest income was down $730 million on lower rates, including the impact of faster prepaid on mortgage securities, as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. Declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments. And expensive of $361 million were roughly flat year-on-year as well. Now shifting gears, I will turn to our outlook for 2021, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 12. As you can see on the page, we expect NII to be around $55.5 billion in 2021 and this is based on the latest insights, which reflects the steepening yield curve we have seen over the past few weeks. You can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impacts of low rates in 2021 from continued deposit growth and higher markets NII. But it\u2019s important to note that it takes a loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve. I will also just remind you that the increase in CIB markets NII is largely offset in NIR and this component is highly market dependent. And so as it relates to loan growth, while there should be some opportunities in AWM and Wholesale, we expect headwinds at least in the near-term as Corporate cash balances are at all time high, Card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in Home Lending. But we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year, particularly in Cards. Therefore, our fourth quarter 2021 NII estimate of $14 billion or more is a reasonable exit rate. And notably, that\u2019s in the zip code of our Q4 \u201819 NII, when rates were significantly higher than they are today. We have also included on the right side of the page some risks and opportunities, and obviously this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list, but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this year\u2019s NII outlook. Now turning to expenses on page 13. As Jamie mentioned last month, we do expect our expenses to increase in 2021 and based on our latest work, we expect that number to be around $68 billion, up versus the prior guidance of $67 billion, largely due to higher volume and revenue related expenses and the impact of FX, both of which have offsets on the revenue line, as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxLoyalty. Then taking a look at the year-over-year expense growth, you can see it\u2019s primarily due to investments, which I will cover in more detail on the next page. Our volume and revenue related expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there. That\u2019s obviously market dependent, but remember any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our topline. And in structural, we expect a net reduction of approximately $200 million. Notably, this includes a decrease of $500 million, reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies in what is largely our fixed cost base. And you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of FX on our non-U.S. dollar expenses. It\u2019s important to note that while structural is coming down, it doesn\u2019t represent the full extent of our productivity, we are realizing efficiencies in each category here. For example, our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we see more customers use our digital tools to self serve. Moving to page 14 to take a closer look at our investment spend. Over the past two years, our investment spend has been around $10 billion and we expect that to increase to nearly $12.5 billion in 2021. You can see that we have highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that we have been consistently investing in for years, which has continued to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth. Starting on the bottom with technology, this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend and these tech investments are across the Board, as we look to better meet our customer and client needs, improve our customer\u2019s digital experience, strengthen our fraud detection capabilities, as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure, cloud and data capabilities. Moving to non-tech investments, we expect marketing spend largely CCB to return to pre-COVID levels this year after being down in 2020. We continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses. This includes hiring bankers and advisors not only in the U.S., but also internationally, as well as expanding our physical footprint. We have been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets having opened 170 branches so far out of our plan 400 and expect to be in all contiguous 48 states by mid-2021, Jamie is clapping. And the other bucket on the page is a catch all for everything else, including real estate and other various investments across our businesses. These expenses were fairly stable the past two years and the increase in 2021 is largely related to our $30 billion commitment to the Path Forward, which includes promoting affordable housing, expanding homeownership for underserved communities and supporting minority owned businesses, and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxLoyalty. So, in summary, you can see that we continue to invest through the cycles and it\u2019s these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment. Now I will turn to a few balance sheet and capital related topics, starting on page 15. Over the next few slides, I\u2019d like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheets. More specifically, this expansion is putting significant pressure on size based capital requirements, which is likely to impact business decisions, including capital targets. We will start with what has happened this year. In response to the COVID crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has significantly expanded, which has resulted in $3 trillion of domestic deposit growth across the U.S. commercial banks. What\u2019s important to note is that this QE is unlike anything you have seen before. In the current QE, we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion, and that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond PPP, as you can see in the loan to deposit ratio on the page. This has resulted in bank balance sheets which are larger but more liquid and less risky. From a bank capital perspective, the key question to ask is how long will this persist? On the chart, you can see that the QE 3 unwind kept the Fed on pause for several years before a modest pace to reductions. So even if the Fed immediately signaled tapering, which of course is not the base case and follows the base case of the last unwind, it will take many years to return to pre-COVID levels. Of course, the unwind speed has risen, but I think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time. Now let\u2019s go to page 16 and see how this will impact capital going forward. Two factors that are top of mind for us are GSIB, which we have been talking about for a long time and also SLR, which is not something we typically talk about, but given the overall system expansion now in focus. On the graph, what you can see here are the historical trends of GSIB and SLR base requirements overlaid with the task of the Fed securities holdings. You can see that during the original calibration of these rules, which included significant gold plating, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet was notably lower. With the recent growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, we are seeing upward pressure and increases to GSIB requirements, as well as the SLR shifting from a backstop to a binding measures, which will impact the pace of capital return and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period. The Fed temporary relief of SLR expires after March 31t. This adjustment for cash and treasury should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended. With these exclusions, you can see how these remains a backstop measure not a binding one. Then on GSIB, there has been public dialogue about the need to index the score to GDP as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time and this was also cited by the Fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework. For 2020, GDP is clearly not the best proxy for system expansion, but the principle still applies. GSIB was designed as a relative measure between large and medium-sized banks, and therefore, it should certainly reflect an overall system expansion, which impacted small, medium and large banks alike. By future proofing GSIB and inception with the adjustments outlined on the page, you can see the resulting GSIB score profile, lower over time, but more importantly, flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion. While we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements to promote safety and soundness, satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas, GSIB and leverage are top of mind for us in 2021. Now let\u2019s look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on page 17. In addition to what we have already discussed, there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics, and they are interest rates and loan demand. We have experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand, which have reduced the NIM of marginal deposits to practically zero, which you can see here on the chart, and this is an issue for all banks, not just GSIBs or JPMorgan. However, what is specific to the larger banks that when the SLR becomes binding, we may be required to issue debt and retain higher equity, which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative ROI proposition in today\u2019s ultra-low rate environment. The key question is, what could happen next. We could simply shy away from taking new deposits, redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of that cost, which is certainly something we wouldn\u2019t want to do in this environment. And therefore, we strongly encourage a serious look at these size-based capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency, as we will soon be facing this critical business decision. All of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments, namely an extension of the SLR exclusions and the GSIB fixes we have spoken about over time. But to be clear, we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in 2020. But we are also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence and recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward. With all that said, Before I close things out on capital, here\u2019s how we are thinking about target CET1 levels. While GSIB pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high, our SCB optimization can provide some offset allowing us to manage to 12% CET1 target. The recent stress test showed an implied 20-basis-point reduction to SCB and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission. So we are hopeful for lower SCB later this year, of course that\u2019s scenario dependent. At this point, it\u2019s too early to provide specific color on the impact of SLR. So it\u2019s just important to note that in the absence of any adjustments to the measures, we may have to issue preferred or carry additional CET1 over the 12% target I just mentioned. We obviously can\u2019t emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly front and center as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near- and medium-term. Now before we conclude, know that we have included a few additional slides on our businesses in the appendix to give you an update on their strategic highlights and performance, as well as provide the latest financial outlook. The themes and initiatives we talked about at last year\u2019s Investor Day still remain our focus, and we continue to execute and make progress against them. So to wrap up, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year. But it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale, and the resulting earnings power of our company, while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers, clients and communities. While downside risks do remain in the near-term and they could be significant, several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longer term. So with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jen and Happy New Year. Jennifer Piepszak : Happy New Year, Steve. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Steven Chubak : So I want to start off with a question on the NII outlook. The 2021 guide implies rather healthy step up versus the $54 billion, Jamie, that you had reiterated just last month. And your updated NII guide for \u201821, what are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curve steepening? And separately, what are your assumptions around the trajectory for Card balances and overall growth in \u201821, especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus, which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So, I will start with excess liquidity. So I think there the theme is we are being opportunistic but patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we have seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves, and as we think about managing the balance sheet, it\u2019s not just about NII, of course it\u2019s about capital. And so, there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell off. So we are being very patient. But we have been and we will continue to be optimistic, and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s what we are assuming in the outlook is a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then\u2026 Jamie Dimon : In the implied terms. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. In the implied terms. Yeah. And then on card balances, it is quite extraordinary what we are seeing in terms of payment rates in the card portfolio, which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to deleverage, so there is an offset in the -- on the credit line, but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as spend recovers, but it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated. So that\u2019s why everything listed on that page is a plus/minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk. Steven Chubak : Okay. Fair enough. And just for my follow up, I wanted to ask on capital, both the slides are really interesting highlighting the impact of QE on the leverage ratio and G-SIB scores. You have been critical of G-SIB surcharges and the need to recalibrate these coefficients for some time. We haven\u2019t really seen much progress there. It kind of feels like waiting for the [indiscernible]. I think the Fed is slow to recalibrate the minimum leverage ratios to account for this QE-driven deposit growth. What mitigating actions can you take to ensure you are not capital constrained as balance sheet growth continues? And maybe any revenue attrition we need to contemplate as part of those mitigating actions? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So I will start with G-SIB, if we take that in turn. So starting with G-SIB, as I said, we do think that we have opportunity in the SCB. Of course, that\u2019s scenario dependent and based on the Fed models, but we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that we have been doing. It will be very difficult for us to get back to 3.5% with the current expansion. So, we are expecting to remain in the 4% bucket. But as you know, that\u2019s not effective until early 2023, so that gives us time to manage SCB, as I mentioned, as an offset. On the leverage issues, we have -- we can cure this through issuing preferreds, but we haven\u2019t made that decision yet, as I said, because it is a critical decision for us to think about. And as you think about capital return, it would depend on where our stock price is as we think about the economic value of issuing preferred to buy back stocks. So there\u2019s a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months. Jamie Dimon : Because you said the G- SIB fees, it\u2019s very important. If we were on the international standard, our G- SIB fee would be 2%, not 4%. And we have been talking about they were supposed to adjust G-SIB before the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system. Because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to non-banks and private credit goes elsewhere, and the rest of the international, Chinese banks are growing, et cetera. So these adjustments should be made. We pointed out there is $1.3 trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on our balance sheet which shockingly reached G-SIFI 2. G-SIFI has no risk weighted measurements to it, no diversification to it, no profitability to it. It just kind of these very gross measures, and it needs to be recalibrated and same with SLR. I mean, so do we expect it to happen? Probably not in our lifetimes, because we have politicized bank, detailed bank numbers and so on, and we can live with it for now. But in the long run, it\u2019s not good for America and had been that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Sorry. Sorry. Hi. Sorry, I was on mute for a second there. Maybe just talking about loan growth? You saw a pretty nice improvement in the Wholesale side. You talked about some opportunities in \u201821. It seems to be mostly coming out of the CIB. Is that sort of acquisition finance? What\u2019s driving some of the improvement on the Wholesale side? Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. I would say acquisition financing is the opportunity on the Wholesale side. When we -- there may be some opportunity in the back half of 2021 in C&I. That feels like it\u2019s returning to BAU, but I think that\u2019s going to take some time. But as I said, we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheets, and so outside of acquisition financing and C&I, it will be challenging C&I in the back half of 2021. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe on your expense assumptions for the $68 billion, you don\u2019t really mention at all any of the CIB. You would think that if we are, as everyone assumes, we had a record year in 2020, 2021, maybe markets and IB fees are lower. Is there any kind of -- are you building in some lower comps -- revenue based compensation expense in that $68 billion or is that potential a positive? Jennifer Piepszak : So we capture that in the volume and revenue related, Jim. It just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenue related growth elsewhere. Jamie Dimon : I just point out the $68 billion. We don\u2019t make commitments or promises, so that $68 billion, I would love to find $2 billion more of investments, literally. I mean, we are seeking every year find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that. So that\u2019s kind of our current forecast. And fortunately, we found some more to do, including cxLoyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology we are building, et cetera. But I\u2019d like to find more. It would be the best and possible highest use of our capital. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, John. John McDonald : Hi, Jen. Given the outlook for net interest income and expenses, it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to pick up a few 100 basis points this year in \u201821 versus \u201820. And I know you don\u2019t manage it necessarily year-to-year, but just kind of overtime you seem to have a mid 50s efficiency target. Just kind of wondering how you put guard rails up for yourself in terms of expense discipline in managing over time to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency corridor? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So I will start by saying you are absolutely right that we don\u2019t manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter or even any year and but operating leverage is very important to us. And then, we gave last year at Investor Day at about a 55% efficiency ratio. I will say in a normalized environment, we haven\u2019t had anything that structurally has changed and so that should still be achievable for us in a normalized rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then as it relates to expense discipline, it is a bottoms up process. And so everywhere around this company, we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that, which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that is an investment or volume and revenue related, isn\u2019t necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiencies. So the discipline is everywhere and it\u2019s the way we run the company, and we do believe in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt. John McDonald : Okay. And then as a follow up, on the NII walk, you have got a $1 billion incremental NII expected in \u201821 versus \u201820 from markets -- CIB markets. Can that be true if markets revenues is down year-over-year? Can they both be true? Just maybe explain that? Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. It can absolutely be true. So markets is, I mean, in most of our businesses, we don\u2019t run them NII versus non-interest revenue. It is an accounting construct. But markets is particularly true. So, yes, that is possible. In NII, the markets business, you can think about is liability sensitive. So you are going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply anything about the overall performance. Jamie Dimon : We have positive carry, the trading profit goes down and the carry goes up, the number -- absolute numbers are same. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi. Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the outlook for Card losses. The 2.17% net charge-off rate was certainly eye opening relative to what\u2019s happened in 2020. And the discussions actually that I have been having with investors on the trajectory of Card is, do you think that the bridge that the government built is strong enough that we may not see a spike in losses in Cards like we are all expecting, and Jen, given your comments earlier, what would you need to see to feel more comfortable about releasing reserves from your Card portfolio? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So it\u2019s interesting that you brought up the bridge being strong enough. It does feel like at this point in this crisis, that the bridge has been strong enough. The question that still remains is, is the bridge long enough. And so, while we just had recent stimulus pass, that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough. But we have to get through the next three months to six months. So it feels like we have been saying that, since this crisis started, but I think it is particularly true at this point, obviously, given the vaccine rollout. So, consumer confidence is still low relative to pre-COVID levels. You can converse that with -- compare that to the Wholesale side, we are seeing confidence is up. That\u2019s not true on the consumer side. And so the next three months to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether or not only is it strong enough, but is it long enough and do you see consumer sentiment pick up a bit. There\u2019s also possibility for payment shops as some relief programs, whether it be student loan, forbearance or tax -- taxes owed on benefits received. There are things that could hit a consumer in the next three months to six months that we need to think about. Jamie Dimon : Right. I would just add, very different for subprime and prime. And if you look at our portfolio, it\u2019s mostly prime. And the folks in the prime category have a lot more income, a lot more savings, housing prices are up. They did not lose their jobs. So the news there is actually rather good. On the lower quartiles it\u2019s the opposite. Even now when we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about $12 million of them, which have already been processed. Jennifer Piepszak : $12 billion. Jamie Dimon : $12 million. $12 billion, $12 million for 12 Billion approximately and there\u2019s the bottom. But the folks who had $1,000 in their accounts, where the accounts are coming down and they just got $1,000, they obviously needed. The folks in the higher end, they obviously don\u2019t need quite as much. So it\u2019s positive -- we expected to go up, but it\u2019s possible somehow that doesn\u2019t happen in some dramatic way. Erika Najarian : Got it. And Jamie, my second question is for you. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019d say, we are making this point very important. Erika Najarian : Yes. Jamie Dimon : We do not consider taking down reserves recurring or low income. We don\u2019t do show across. We don\u2019t consider a profit. It\u2019s ink on paper. It\u2019s based upon lots of different calculations. Obviously, we want real loss to be lower over time. But just if you Card reserves like $17 billion, we took it down next quarter, because we have more optimistic outlooks, we are not going to be sitting here cheering about that, but we are cheering they are much [ph] doing better. But we don\u2019t want to consider that in earnings. I think you all should look at a little bit differently now, particularly with the change in accounting rules. Erika Najarian : Yeah. I think your investors appreciate that. And the second question I had for you, Jamie is, in last -- on last year\u2019s Investor Day, it was clear to your investor base that you were looking to inorganically enhance your scale in AWM. And what interesting is that, the discussion that I have been having with your investors more recently is them wondering whether or not you would consider a larger deal maybe in payments, given that a lot of investors and banks are thinking that that\u2019s the part that seems to be potentially more vulnerable to technology competitors? What are your thoughts there, and I guess, my own thought process has been tempered by Jennifer\u2019s presentation on capital, but we wanted to get your thoughts there? Jamie Dimon : Again, we have -- I mean, our capital [inaudible], okay. We have so much capital we cannot use it. If you look at what happened this year, our capital went from 12.4% to 13.3%. And by I think advanced is more representative of real risks it will be 13.8%. That\u2019s after doing $2 trillion of loans, $12 trillion of reserves, $12 trillion -- $12 billion of reserved, $12 billion of dividend. I mean, we are earning, if you look at pretax -- pre-provision $45 billion or $50 billion a year. So we are in very good shape to invest. The most important thing we said to management, we says that we grow that every business organically, every single one opening branches and accounts, doing payments, and we put a lot of time and effort in payments. We are quite good at it between credit card, debit card, Chase merchant services. But I agree with you and but we are open for inorganic too. Inorganic shouldn\u2019t be an excuse not for growing organically and it\u2019s not just Chase, it\u2019s not just asset management, it will be any area where we could do that, I don\u2019t think cxLoyalty was neat thing, [inaudible] was neat thing, we bought 55 IP, which is a special way to manage money, tax efficiently. And so we are going to build it ourselves or buy it. We are open minded. Anyone you have good ideas for us, let us know. We have the wherewithal, but we thought we will also look at buying it. Like I said, we are always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently. We have got a tremendous set of assets. We also have a tremendous debt of competitors, particularly in payments, consumer land now and a bunch of other areas. So you saw Google Pay. You saw Wal-mart is going to try to spend a bit more time is expanding. And we like competition, we believe in it. But we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind and how we run our business. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Jamie a question on cxLoyalty, because I thought your loyalty program and capability set there in your payment space and your consumer facing space was quite good. So I am just wondering what the rationale was and is there an expectation that you are going to be leveraging that into non-Card portions of your business, was that part of the so what was this deal? Jennifer Piepszak : So, Betsy, I will take that one. So this -- we are really excited about this one and really with any tech platform scale matters. So combining our scale with cxLoyalty\u2019s innovative technology will be a win not only for our Chase customers but for cxLoyalty\u2019s existing clients and suppliers. And then you are right to point out our existing UR platform, but that today is predominantly used as a point production portal. So there\u2019s a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel, which is $140 billion both on and off us. So in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform, we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel. Betsy Graseck : Okay. But still focused on the Card space as opposed to moving into other parts of your relationship with consumers? Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s consumer, this thing was consumer. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Jennifer Piepszak : Has no [inaudible]. It has to be Card only. Yeah\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Jen, mentioned the number, like more than 30% of travel expense goes through our Cards, something like that. And so we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them to travel. You are right, ultimate reward always does a good job. But why would you try to double that overtime or triple it? Jennifer Piepszak : And we think we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers. So it won\u2019t just be about Chase customers. Jamie Dimon : Exactly. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the follow up question just on the technology budget increasing, I mean, I know this comes after a year of being somewhat stable year-on-year. And just wanted to dig into the comment you made on the page around data analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence capabilities. Again, you have been a leader in this for a while. So the question is what -- where\u2019s the whitespace that you are moving into? And can you give us a sense as to how important this is for some of the expansion that you are doing geographically in U.K. digital and some of the European footprint that you are expanding into? Jamie Dimon : So, first of all, cyber we are going to do -- we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in everything we do. But you mentioned, we built a brand new data centers pretty much around the world, which are a lot more efficient. They are going to be effectively not cloud base, but they have all the cloud, technology, et cetera, for our own private cloud. When we move other stuff to the public cloud, we are refactoring applications to get there, where we are doing all the data, you all know the issue with data, not that banks were bad, but data was held in all these different accounts, you are trying to build these data links, you can use AI and machine learning better and it all do haste. The cloud is real. The cost is real. The speed is real. The security is real. The AI is real. The machine learning is real. So every single business and with every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud, whether it\u2019s internal or external? What are we adding AI machinery on? Are we getting the data analytics right and it is global. It\u2019s -- and we don\u2019t spend that much time on it. But every single business is doing it. You have a tremendous amount of AI being used in asset wealth management, CIB, in trading, in Commercial Banking prospecting and it\u2019s literally the tip of the iceberg. Whatever we say today, 10 years from now, it will be probably 50 times more than we are doing today. And I would spend anything to get it done faster. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on capital return and capital usage, in the deck and in your press release, you mentioned that you are looking to get back into more return of capital, you mentioned $4.5 billion net and there\u2019s still the net income test. And I just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through how you think about full usage of that $4.5 billion and then how do you think forward vis-\u00e0-vis the comments we just talked about with regards to potential external opportunities and what\u2019s the best use of that incremental capital, given that you still have a healthy amount sitting there? Jennifer Piepszak : Sure. So we always start in the same place, which is we would much prefer to do the things that Jamie\u2019s been talking about when to buy back our stocks. So we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or acquisitions. Having said that, we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point. When we look at the first quarter, the Fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend, that\u2019s where you get to the $4.5 billion. So that is the capacity that we have for this quarter and we will do up to that amount, obviously, I don\u2019t know that we will do the full amount, but we will certainly do, obviously, can\u2019t do more than $4.5 billion. And then we are certainly hopeful that we can go back to the EU under the SCB framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks. But we will wait to see what the Fed says at the end of the first quarter. Ken Usdin : Okay. Great. Thanks. Jamie Dimon : If you can manage your capital down to the 12% or whatever we said, with that regards have been getting permission from the Fed. They have already implied that\u2019s what they can do. That\u2019s the way it should be done eventually one day. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Understood. Jamie Dimon : Another way to point out is that, we have been consistent in 2 times tangible book, but our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that, it still makes sense to buy back stock. But that diminishes every point, 2.1 or 2.2, or 2.3, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. I mean, we will always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative we are going to keep doing it. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Consistent with what you have said in the past. Thanks. And just a question on the Card business, you mentioned how much of that spend goes through Chase and just you are -- given that we still have some uncertainties with regards to a true return to open. Yeah, your Card segment revenue yield actually did improve a little bit. I am just wondering if you can kind of help us, just think through, just the pushes and pulls you see on the Card business with regards to your expectations of spend improving, balances improving and competition underneath? Thanks. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. So competition remains very, very strong. As it relates to the revenue yield, it\u2019s a little bit of noise there, because balances are down so much and that\u2019s what that\u2019s derived from. So there\u2019s a little bit of noise there. Importantly, we do, if GDP is back to 2019 levels by the middle of the year, we expect them to continue to recover, and perhaps, significantly, so in the second half. As it relates to travel, whether it\u2019s the second half of \u201821 or \u201822, we are confident that our customers will continue to travel and there\u2019s pent-up demand on shore for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities, whether they come in \u201821 or \u201822 or beyond, Jamie Dimon : We take very seriously the new entrance like the Goldman Sachs Card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things that we expect to see more of that. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello, there. Thank you. So I think it\u2019s good time of the year to get your mark-to-market on, your thoughts on the competitive landscape and I know every business is competitive. But I am more curious on the new side of competitive and maybe I am talking more about the Consumer & Commercial Banking right now. But between all the neo banks that either want to pay much more than you guys on deposits or charge no fees, or the pay -- buy now pay later models, or things where you also even play in banking-as-a-service in trying to provide banking products to big technology companies with big client footprints. I am most curious to see, is this just normal evolution and not changing things or is there something bigger going on here that you want to comment on? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. So I am going to -- in the Commercial Bank it is probably less than you think. I do think there are alternative credit providers. But we will just do a lot of things for our clients, they can quit investment banking, FX swaps, cash management custody, asset management, et cetera. So it\u2019s slightly different. I got a consumer saw me and we wrote in the Chairman\u2019s letter years ago that Silicon Valley is coming. And I think it\u2019s just more and faster and better and quicker. And we have to just be very conscious that includes pay now, pay later and we have some of the products ourselves, but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and Gordon always points out, when you have that kind of products that goes to keep it simple, clear, basic, what the customer wants, to just to deliver more and better and so we are quite conscious. And I would also add, by the way, it\u2019s not just that, we have -- the team looks at and financial and early pay and all these other competitors. I expect one day, you can see other big foreign banks back here again, including the big Chinese banks, the biggest ones were bigger than us. And I am -- that may be five years or 10 years out, but we better be thinking five years or 10 years out. And so they are all coming, we were comfortable, but we are still exercising and taking our vitamins, okay? Jennifer Piepszak : And it\u2019s another reason our investments are going up as much, yeah, because we are very well aware of it. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. Keep taking those vitamins. Maybe along the same lines, I think, you spoke -- spoken about the power that the data of your own client footprints and franchises have. I am just curious, we haven\u2019t heard that much lately about what you are collecting, how you can use it, how you can use it to enhance the customer experience accelerate growth. You have all this at your fingertips and people talk about data as being the new golden. I am curious on how you are thinking about it right now? Jamie Dimon : Yes, yes and yes. That\u2019s all we are going to tell you. I mean, I have talked about how important AI is, obviously, the data in that. AI is data directly related and some of it gets used very well. But if you shut down, some of it doesn\u2019t get used well. We have restrictions, far more restrictions than some of our Silicon Valley competitors. But still there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients. And we do a tremendous amount already in marketing, risk, fraud, cyber, you name it. And we use a lot of that -- like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I will ask my question and go back in the queue. Just, I guess, I miss your Investor Day. We have four slides to talk about that. I guess, if your capital cup run us over, maybe your expense budget could run us over too. I mean, spending is certain, returns are uncertain. So seems like there\u2019s more questions this year than in the past. You did get positive off the leverage last year during the pandemic. So, yes, you have earned the right to go ahead and spend more. I think most people would agree. But there\u2019s still just so many questions, so I will just ask on CCB. It looks like slide 16. You mentioned going to all 48 states by mid-2021. I didn\u2019t really get all of that. So what -- how many states have you been in and by the time you get to 48, how much spending is that? What\u2019s the game plan? What\u2019s your plan with branches? Others are shutting branches after the pandemic, you are expanding. If you could just give some color on that or if Gordon\u2019s on the call, we can hear from him too? Jamie Dimon : Gordon\u2019s not, but so we have -- we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that. We are still -- we are closing plenty of branches. So if you look at what we are doing, we got the number of leads, we have closed like 1,000 the last four years or five years and we have opened like 1,000 or something like that. But -- and I think we did the Bank One JPMorgan deal, we were in 21 states, 23 states. And when we started the expansion originally, the -- we were very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branches differently and you made hub and spoke and we are always testing new things and stuff like that. But we still have almost a million people today who visit branches and it\u2019s down, but it\u2019s a million people a day, I have got the number, 60% to 70% accounts still open in branches, small businesses still need branches. And the new branches that we opened in Boston, Philadelphia, D.C., they have been doing quite well. And the shocking thing is doing quite well in Card, consumer, investments, small business. So as we go to the all the other states, we just want to be and we know we have to have certain size, not going in each state with one just to plant the flag. That would be kind of waste of time. We look at the major markets, number of people already know us through Chase and stuff like that. And so we are optimistic that the strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses and our capabilities and other things, I am not going to tell you because it\u2019s very competitive. I think we have shared too much with our competitors in the past. So I am going to kind of shut myself up a little bit. Jennifer Piepszak : No. But, Mike, I can just add a little bit of color on the numbers. So we had said that we were going to open up 400 new branches in market expansion. So we have done 170 So far. Importantly, in 2020, we did fewer than 90, and in 2021 we are going to do 150. And so, of course, we -- by 2022 or 2023, that\u2019s going to start to sunset. So there are in the numbers multiyear investments that will -- they are ramping maybe in \u201821, but they will ramp down now that obviously gives us capacity to reinvest those dollars. But we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up. In tech as an example, 10% or 20% of that number in any given year is completed. So that gives us more dollars to reinvest. And then the only thing I\u2019d add on branches is this like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and I think underestimated, because it give us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been able to do. So it\u2019s not just about consumer banking. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. And it gives me a chance to North Dakota, which is the only state I have never been in. But believe it or not, we already do a lot of middle market, credit card more in North Dakota. We just didn\u2019t do Consumer Banking. So I do the second where I am allowed, I am on my way to like Bismarck or Fargo or something like. Okay, we have just the new Head of Investor Relations, who is sitting in this room right now, Reggie Chambers, who I am sure you will get to know. This was part of what he did for Sun Belt, which is the all branch expansion, though we don\u2019t really restrict them how much you can tell you. But -- and including looking at different formats. We are not blind to the nature that you have the world changing and digital all that. So we can very quickly, just so, I have got the number change the fleet, like if you said, you have got the world changing more rapidly, we are completely comfortable that in a five-year period, you can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet, et cetera, while serving clients. Mike Mayo : Okay. So this is kind of like what you did with Commercial Bank few years back going to every state, I guess, but 48 states, where were you, say, a year ago or three years ago, just to give final context to that. Jamie Dimon : 48 states three years ago. I mean, by the way, Commercial Bank, same thing. We talked about expansion. So we bought WaMu, it took years, but we said we are going to do $1 billion in the WaMu states, which is mostly California, Florida, Atlanta. So we got -- what we are very close to hitting that. I thought governor was like $908 million this year or something like that. I told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit $1 billion, I want to send a case of really expensive why we are, like, why the guy called Steve Walker, who did it for us and have great. And we told him, right, like great bankers, great capabilities, stuff like that. We were doing $400 million of Investment Banking business when we did the Bank One deal JPMorgan through the Commercial Bank. We set a target of $1 billion and $2 billion and $3 billion, we exceeded $3 billion. I think we did $3.5 billion. The new target is $4 billion. It\u2019s now 25% to 30% of domestic U.S. Investment Banking, which DCM, ECM, M&A through that network and the Investment Bank -- the Commercial Bank expanded into healthcare, technology and we have a couple other areas we are going to be rolling out soon. So these expansions really makes sense. They pay for themselves. They are relentless. They are hard to do. They are obviously right? Mike Mayo : Okay. I will read to you. Jamie Dimon : And remember the Commercial Bank deal in these branches. It\u2019s very hard to judge and we have done it. But it\u2019s very hard to build the quality business without a retail branches when you are a Commercial Bank. But you will see very few Commercial Banks that don\u2019t have retail branches. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the expense outlook. I noticed there was a small piece in there related to the workforce optimization, but I guess thinking in the broader context, as we get through COVID-19 and move to the post-COVID-19 world, the general thought process was that there would be this big expense save opportunity coming from that, work-from-home environment. But it doesn\u2019t really show in your expense outlook. Is it something that you didn\u2019t expect to see beyond 2021? Is this a\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Brian Kleinhanzl : \u2026step down expenses. Jamie Dimon : But in the big picture there are people expenses $33 billion, for real estate expenses, I am going to say $3 billion. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. Jamie Dimon : So, yeah, even -- and I do think it can be much more efficient than that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like a game changer. Jennifer Piepszak : And we can\u2019t move our footprint that quickly anyway. So we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully. Jamie Dimon : But Jen is thinking about moving the finance function to Florida. Jennifer Piepszak : Hawaii. Yes. Jamie Dimon : Hawaii. Jennifer Piepszak : Hawaii, that\u2019s right. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a follow up, but maybe on the international, I saw still the billion hopes of additional revenue on the international. Just give an update on how that\u2019s tracking so far? Jennifer Piepszak : Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Jamie Dimon : The billion what? Brian Kleinhanzl : On the international revenue expansion that you were looking for? Jamie Dimon : Okay. The -- firstly, Investment Bank is expanding globally everywhere as best we can and so as asset management and because we already spoke about China and stuff like that, the Commercial Banks started an international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we are not covering and it\u2019s doing fine. It\u2019s mostly expense right now. We added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and we didn\u2019t add -- we have been adding clients as we were quite happy with it. I should point out that we just had the best year ever in Asia. I mean, I think, it was up like 20% or something like that. So and Asia is still will be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. So our -- and that\u2019s kind of country-by-country to make sure we get that right. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jennifer. Hi, Jamie. Can you guys share with us, obviously, there\u2019s been a change in the administration in the Senate and a number of our regulatory body heads are going to be replaced this year, including the FCC and the Consumer Protection Bureau. Can you guys give us some color what you are thinking about what may change from a regulatory standpoint with the different political party controlling Washington now? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. Our focus is always the same. We have got 60 million U.S. clients. We have got 6,000 investment clients around the world. We have got -- we run this company to serve clients, communities, hospitals. We financed $100 billion in states, cities, schools, hospitals each year. That\u2019s what we do. And obviously, we want to satisfy all of our regulators. So I do expect that, there will be a new set of regulators. We will have a new set of demands. Some we agree with. We want to do a better job in climate for the world. We want to be more green. We want to help the disadvantage. We rolled out an enormous amount of progress in racial equality and things like that. So, yeah, but they will be tougher. That\u2019s life. It\u2019s life around the world. We are going to -- we have to do a whole bunch of new regulators, which we are trying to satisfy in the ECB, et cetera. And so, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t need to change our life that much and competitively, everyone\u2019s in the same kind of boat and so it will be fine. And we want the new president to be successful. Gerard Cassidy : And then following up, Jennifer, you talked about on page 17 of your slide deck, the issue with deposits and the marginal benefit of these deposits and you guys are wrestling with this issue? Can you share with us, yeah, and you already have talked about the branch expansion in all 48 states could save you U.S. states? How is this going to be managed is best you can over the next 12 months to 24 months, because obviously, long-term you want that branch expansion, but simultaneously, as you have pointed out, you may be getting a negative ROI, if you don\u2019t get relief on the SLR? And is there a chance that you will get that extension on the SLR from the regulators? Jennifer Piepszak : So I will start with, we certainly remain hopeful that we will get the extension. Importantly, as we think about branch expansion near-term rate headwinds, we certainly consider that, but at the margin there not a factor given the long-term franchise value associated with the branch expansion and the fact that it\u2019s not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway, because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion. But we do consider in the analytics there the near-term headwinds from rates. But there is a steady state number which is more of a normalized level of rates. So it doesn\u2019t -- at a margin it might change some decisions around marketing, but it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on us. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. The bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is out of the investment bank. It\u2019s repo, deposits, corporate clients, trade finance, all those other things. So the -- this is managed very, very closely. Remember GSIB uses one of, say, 20 constraints we managed by business, by product, by area, by region, by\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. And we bring it up, obviously, it is an issue for us in the near- to medium-term, should we not get the extension and it\u2019s one that\u2019s important for people to understand. But we bring it up more so because it should, another example of where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact, not just on JPMorgan. So we don\u2019t bring it up just because of the impact on JPMorgan. We bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration. You have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and we are just seeing that\u2019s not the case. Jamie Dimon : Look we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. Jamie Dimon : So we don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s is very customer friendly and say, could you take your deposits elsewhere, but\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : Right. Jamie Dimon : They do have -- a lot of this larger corporate client who have other options and bunch of deposits, but money market funds or something like that. So we are mad. It is not -- none of this is going to be an issue for 2021, folks. I mean, fundamentally, it is just how we were a company and even if that temporary relief goes away. And I am always against temporary relief, because for this exact reason, it creates another cliff, even if it goes away we are fine, we just have to manage it much tighter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Maybe a bit of a basic question, but why is markets revenue are trading so good still, not just for you, but the overall wallet? I gather it to be investment banking business, the feeder businesses still very good, there\u2019s lots of liquidity, banks have lots of capital, but of course rates are near zero, budget tight, volatility is low. I will take away some of the answers. But just conceptually it\u2019s been very strong. It sounds like the hope is it will remain strong. What\u2019s really driving it? Jamie Dimon : There is $350 billion of global financial assets, $50 trillion -- $350 trillion, and probably, in 10 years or 20 years that number is going to be $700 trillion. People have to buy and sell to hedge, finance, with money around the world, FX, currencies, our pension plans. Obviously, volumes go up and down. Spreads generally over time has been coming down, what you would expect in a competitive market. So with the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that Jen showed you, the $3 trillion or $4 trillion in the Fed, but globally it is $12 trillion. And companies have a lot of financing to do. And of course, when you have higher DCM and higher ECM and higher M&A that also drives a lot of trading and so you got to kind of put that all in the mix. Matt O\u2019Connor: And obviously, the question is how sustainable is this, and I guess, one argument could be that technology has allowed banks to increase the velocity. You can talk about this for some time. Do you think that is a structural change that will benefit the businesses and specifically for you guys over a long-term time period? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. The way we look is we kept our share of what things we are trying to find digitized and the business has done a kind of the way we expected them to do it. So, yeah, we think scale matters, technology matters, and hopefully, we think we can even grow our share. This is just trench warfare. So we expect to grow it, but we -- I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s a very hard to say, what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of revise down sometime last year, but will stay as high as it stayed in 2020 then I doubt. It may not go back to what it was. It may be higher than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi Charles. Charles Peabody : Good morning. I have a couple of questions related to fintech and unfortunately I was born in a wrong generation, so I need a lot of help. How dependent is the fintech world on the banking system, as I understand they lay on top of the pipes in the plumbing of the banking system. Do you have any leverage in a competitive world against the fintech world? And then, secondly, I noticed that the OCC gave banks the green light to use public blockchain networks and stable points. Can you explain how -- what important that has to JPMorgan? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. You go ahead with blockchain there. Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Sure. So that guidance enables an offering of stable going on a public blockchain. So that doesn\u2019t impact JPM point. JPM point, you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits. So it\u2019s obviously very early. We will assess use cases and customers demand. But it\u2019s still too early to see where this goes for us. Jamie Dimon : And we are using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so we are at the forefront of that which is good. The other question was about fintech. Look first of all, they are very good competitors. I pointed out to a lot of people, PayPal were $250 million, Squares were done in $20 million, Stripe is worth $80 billion, Ant Financial is down quite a bit now. But they are there. They are strong. They are smart, some effectively ride the rails. So we bank a lot of them. We help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and you have. So my view is we are going to compete, we will need to and we have to look at our -- look inside about what we could do better or could have done better and things like that. So I am confident we will be able to compete. But I think we now are facing old generation of newer, tougher, faster competitors who -- and if they don\u2019t buy the rails of JPMorgan, they can buy rails of someone else. So you see, I have told you before, everyone is going to be involved in payments. Some banks going to white label, which makes which makes fintech competitors white label the bank and build every sort of thing on top of it and we have to be prepared for that. I expect it to be very, very tough competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win. So help me God. Charles Peabody : Thanks. So did they need the banking system to complete their loop of service or can they work completely outside the bank? Jamie Dimon : Well, the most will do for now, but I think it\u2019s a mistake because it\u2019s going to be forever. The game of bank licenses, Utah is giving industrial licenses. Like I said, banks are white labeling. So it\u2019s effectively the same thing. If a fintech companies uses a white label bank just to process their business, they are basically a bank. When -- what the regulator will do, I don\u2019t know, but we have to assume that they are going to do it. And that some don\u2019t need, will find ways, not to use their banking system, which they have done. I mean, if you look at a whole bunch of the things they have used stuff around the banking system, which is fine, I am not against that. The regulators may have a point of view about that one day, but I am less worried about that. I am going to worry about us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi Andrew. Andrew Lim : Hi. Hi. Good morning. And so\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Look, Charles, one other point, if our examples unfair competition, which we will do something about eventually. People who we will make a lot more on debit, because they activate under certain things, the only reason they compete is because of that. People basically don\u2019t do KYC AML and create risk for the system. And I can go on and on, but that part we will be a little bit more aggressive on, people who improperly use data has been given to them by client, okay? So you can expect that there will be other battle to take place here. Andrew Lim : Hi. Sorry. It\u2019s Andrew Lim here. So I just wanted to pick your brains on inflation and hopefully inflation metrics are picking up. If we look at rates, if you look at the inflation indicators and that\u2019s like a lot of people are jumping on this replacement bandwagon. But I just wanted to see what you are seeing on the ground in a real world as to how this might be manifesting itself even in Commercial Banking or in Investment Banking in terms of like the month, products or volatility. Is that something that you see as a theme developing? Jamie Dimon : I mean, look, we don\u2019t have that much more insight than you do. You do see signs witnessing in commodities and certain products and consumer goods and stuff like that. It\u2019s hard to tell that supply lines that can\u2019t keep up with demand or you have long-term trends, China is no longer ending the world. That can change inflation. I think and we looked at when Jen gave those numbers, she always using implied curve. I think the best way to think about it is, I think this should be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth. I think we have good growth and part inflation, but that will become part of conversation, how bad, what I am going to do and things like that. Just so the risk management thing, you got to build into your mindset that you have got to look at there has been a possibility. So I think a year ago, people have said, not possible before COVID and now because the world has done $12 trillion of QE and something like $10 trillion to $12 trillion of fiscal stimulus, you have got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not 2%. That would be great. It is like Goldilocks. But like 3%, 4%. Just so you understand what the risk is that and how we manage through that. It is not the worst thing in the world by the way. The worst in the world is no growth. Andrew Lim : Great. Okay. And for my follow-up question, you talked about how you resolved the issue of excess deposits by pricing way about $200 billion of those. So I am just wondering why you don\u2019t do that now or is the quantum of the problem that much bigger? Jamie Dimon : We don\u2019t have that all, Jen. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. We don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s also -- it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it. This is an issue for everyone. So that could be a challenge. We can\u2019t make them go away. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, one, Jamie, on the topic of payments and competition, Libra\u2019s -- Facebook\u2019s Libra is back out there getting rebranded as Diem and their goal is basically to be global payment network or at least to create one. I am wondering does the OCC stable coin approval do anything for you. You already have JPM coin obviously that\u2019s internal to your own footprint? But I am wondering is there any benefit of the OCC stable coin approval, is there anything with regard to Libra competition that\u2019s coming that would drive changes that you are making in your own platforms? Jamie Dimon : I don\u2019t think so. But -- I don\u2019t think so. We expect stable\u2026 Betsy Graseck : Okay. Jamie Dimon : And obviously there is this talk about several banks having digital currencies and stuff like that, right? Their currency is digital when we move around the world. It\u2019s in central banks where it will move by electrons and stuff like that both. So I do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much. But some of the competitors we want to do, they want to be in payments. They want the payments data. They want to move the money. Again, it\u2019s going to be a regulatory issue about what that means and\u2026 Betsy Graseck : And then if I make sure\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Although, it is not unfair. That\u2019s the only thing I can point. So as long as the competition -- as always we can do it safely and competition can do then it\u2019s hard to argue this -- that\u2019s unfair. Jennifer Piepszak : And Betsy, I mentioned earlier, you might have missed it, but it does not impact JPM coin, JPM coin is different. You should think about that as tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for client. Betsy Graseck : Right. Yeah. No. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. No. I totally get that. I was just thinking hey, if OCC is allowing stable coin maybe they are trying to help move the center of this back into the banking system. That was kind of question. The follow-up was just on back to slide 14 and the other purple area, were the non-technology expenses are moving up year-on-year and part of that is the $30 billion commitment to the path forward initiative. And Jamie, I wanted to understand, like, how you are thinking about that $30 billion? What kind of time frame is that over and where that money is going? I mean we put a note out as you know, this past quarter on housing and on housing inequality and wondering how you are thinking about how you are going to be investing that $30 billion in kind of output that you want from it? Jamie Dimon : Right. So we believe that inequality is a real problem and people don\u2019t always know, but like, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less, which is $32,000 a year something like that. 50 million don\u2019t have employment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they die before. So first time in our lifetimes, our grandparents lifetimes Americans mortality is getting worse, not better and society have to fix these problems. Now we need healthy growth, healthy growth I mean like, but you also need education, infrastructure, healthcare and formerly the racial problem has been around for hundreds of years and with all the things that took place after even -- after the civil rights, we haven\u2019t made the progress we should have made. So we -- and fortunately, lot of other people and companies take this really seriously. How can we help all of American citizen in particular the black community who has been left behind for so long. So our effort is five years, the $30 billion includes, exact numbers we published $8 billion of mortgages to lower, middle income neighborhoods, black neighborhoods, primarily black neighborhoods it includes affordable housing, building affordable housing includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color, it includes defense education. We recently went over a million secure card which is what we expected to do, because these are cards that have all the benefits of banking ATMs, online bill pay for $4.95 a month for lower paid individual who are doing more, more education. Of those 400 branches we are opening, 25% or more will be in LMI neighborhoods. We are financing MBI\u2019s and CBFI\u2019s. So it\u2019s a serious effort, it costs hundreds of millions dollar a year. There are hundreds of people work here. So we have a debt how many loan we are going to put in this neighborhood and how many loans we are going to put in that neighborhood. And we are going to report it that to you, we are not going to -- and we are doing work, we don\u2019t mind things not working, but it will change courses and stuff like that. And so and obviously it includes hiring more open black community training here and stuff like that. So I think these efforts in my own view is that the corporate world have to do this if you want to fix it. It\u2019s not going to happen. We need good government. It is not going to happen just with good government. The jobs at the local level. Unemployment sell branches 20% for \u201820 is still high. The kids didn\u2019t have computer to go home and do their Zooming and schools didn\u2019t have them. And unfortunately, a lot of planned appeasing including my wife send lot of computers to people there, but we have to do something about this. We are always so forth. And in my view we should do it for more purposes of loan that would be sufficient, but for commercial purposes do it. If all the parts American doing better, outcomes and more jobs and healthier people, less crying, less prisons, less drugs and so it\u2019s time to get our act together. And again, I think, business has to work in collaboration with government to do it. I just don\u2019t think it is going to happen alone. It is not going to happen just by yelling at people. The successful companies do not create the slums, but they can help fix them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just following up more on the market expansion. In Commercial Banking, could you just drill down deeper on the international part of that expansion and what\u2019s left to be done in U.S.? Jamie Dimon : I think I will answer U.S., but I think the U.S., again, we are not going to share so much information from now on. But it\u2019s the same thing we looked at all the major SMSAs with the middle market companies, we are doing deep dive in how many there are and I think we are now in 75 of the top 75 roughly. So that expansion is now just going deeper not maybe more at this point. They will be helped little bit by the retail expansion. I think overseas, I just don\u2019t the number of hand\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : I don\u2019t know either. Jamie Dimon : Okay. But you are talking about that will eventually cover and I could be dead wrong in this, 1,000 more clients overseas. These are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarters subsidiaries in U.S. and we could share more of this with you later down the road. Jennifer Piepszak : And I would just. Jamie Dimon : I will tell Charlie, he can\u2019t imitate me on this one. Jennifer Piepszak : Mike, I would just add just from an expense perspective. It is important to remember on the international front that we are riding existing rails that are already there in the CIB. So we can -- this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure. Jamie Dimon : And we usually jelly bank in the U.S. subsidiary\u2026 Jennifer Piepszak : That\u2019s right. Jamie Dimon : Our U.S. headquarters. Jennifer Piepszak : So it\u2019s not the list you might think from an expense perspective. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the other questions that have been asked related to fintech. Jamie, you said, you are going to win, right. But based on valuations of the PayPal, Stripes and Visa, Mastercard anything that fintech related. I mean they trounce valuation of your stock. I think the market saying that others are going to win. So how is JPMorgan is going to -- I mean you said, Silicon Valley is coming what, that was like six years ago or something and then each year we say, yeah, we missed it, we missed it, we missed it, well, it\u2019s still? Jamie Dimon : No. No. No. We never said we -- Mike, we never said we missed it. We have been doing fine over these five years. But we are just lucky. But I do agree with you, I gave that to the management team. My whole operating committee a little deck that show Visa 500 billion, Mastercard 350 billion, PayPal 220 billion, Ant Financial 600 billion, Tencent 800 billion, Alibaba trillion, Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, you go on and on. But absolutely, we should be scared chillers about that. Mike Mayo : So how are you going to win, I mean, just what -- like what\u2026 Jamie Dimon : I am not going to tell you. But we have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We just got to get quicker, better, faster and that\u2019s the -- which we do. We have got -- we have done an exceptional. If you look at what we have done, you would say, we have done a great job. But other people done a good job too. Some have monopolies virtually it is a whole different issue, but. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Jennifer Piepszak : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi. Just one follow up. Obviously, Jennifer, you pointed out that your mortgage production revenue was quite healthy in the quarter and you have penetrated the correspondent champ. Can you guys share with us on the servicing side, with the new -- with the forbearance programs that the government has put into place, is that a positive or negative for servicing revenue as we go forward? Jennifer Piepszak : Okay. Jamie Dimon : Jen will have that one. Jennifer Piepszak : Yes. Yeah. I don\u2019t we know exactly how to answer it, Gerard. All I can say is that, when we give customers the help that they need, if that\u2019s what the bridge them to the other side of this thing, for sure it is good. So I don\u2019t know precisely what the math is, but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s good if it helps get our customers to the other side. We service their mortgage. Gerard Cassidy : In the past when loans go into delinquency obviously and there is -- in a mortgage-backed security, obviously, you guys have to advance the funds and stuff. But the deferral loans are not in that -- I am assuming they are not in that category, is that correct? Jamie Dimon : Yeah. You are absolutely right. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. Jamie Dimon : The cost of servicing the default of loan is like 10 times the Silicon service [ph] and non-deposit loans. So Jen is right. Although, we don\u2019t prudently default, there is probably a small benefit. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Okay. Jennifer Piepszak : I got you. We are talking about advancing the servicing cost. Got it. Jamie Dimon : That\u2019s not an issue either. Jennifer Piepszak : Yeah. No. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. Jennifer Piepszak : At this levels. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate it. Jamie Dimon : Folks, thank you very much for spending time with us. We will speak to you all soon. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.  Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.3 billion, EPS of $4.50, on revenue of $33.1 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 29%. Included in these results are two significant items, $5.2 billion of net credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, and a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation in the form of equity investments. Touching on a few highlights. We saw another strong quarter in CIB. In fact, net income was an all time record with IB fees up 57% year-on-year, reflecting continued robust activity and markets up 25% year-on-year as the environment remain favorable in January and February although it did start to normalize in March. In AWM, we had record net long term inflows of $48 billion this quarter and deposits of $2.2 trillion were up 36% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, as the Fed balance sheet continues to expand. But loan growth remains muted up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on -quarter, with the bright spots being AWM and secured lending in CIB. Onto Page 2 for more detail on our results. When looking at this quarter's performance, there's a lot of noise in the year-on-year comparisons, particularly given what happened in March of last year. And so it's important to remember a few key points here about March 2020. Effectively investment banking activity stopped or got delayed except for investment grade debt issuance. We recorded $950 million of losses in credit adjustments and other in CIB as well as a $900 million mark down on our bridge book. And in credit, we built $6.8 billion of reserves relative to this quarter's release of $5.2 billion. So with that, in mind, revenue of $33.1 billion was up $4.1 billion or 14% year-on-year. Net interest income was down $1.6 billion, or 11% primarily driven by lower rates. And noninterest revenue was up $5.7 billion, or 39%. While this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items I just mentioned, in absolute terms, we saw strong fee generation across the franchise including in investment banking, AWM and home lending as well as a strong performance in markets. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up 12% year-on-year on higher volume and revenue related expenses. The contribution to the Foundation that I just mentioned as well as continued investments. And credit costs were a net benefit of $4.2 billion driven by reserve releases. And here it's worth noting that charge-offs were down about $400 million year-on-year or 28%, and continue to trend near historical lows. Turning to Page 3 for more detail on our reserves. We released approximately $5.2 billion of reserves this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive, indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster than we would have thought just a few months ago. Starting with consumer, in card, we released $3.5 billion as the employment picture has continued to improve. The round three stimulus has provided another level of support and early stage delinquencies remain very low. And in home lending, we release $625 million primarily driven by continued improvement in HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio runoff. And then in wholesale, we released approximately $700 million. While strong recovery seems in motion, we're also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets. So for now, we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios, and at about $26 billion were reserved at approximately $7 billion above the current base case. However, it's worth noting that even in a more normalized environment, we wouldn't expect to be 100% weighted to the base case, as we'll always have some weighting on alternative scenarios. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4; we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1% flat versus the prior quarter as net growth and retained earnings was offset by lower AOCI and higher RWA. Perhaps more interesting ratio right now is SLR which is at 5.5% excluding the temporary relief that just expired. As we said all along, we were never going to rely on short-term temporary relief as a long term planning matters. And this is evidenced by actions we've taken. We've already engaged with our wholesale deposit clients to explore solutions, and we issued $1.5 billion of preferred stock in the first quarter. Having said that it's worth reinforcing a few points here. First, it's important to remember that the SLR is a leverage based requirement, not a risk based requirement. The growth in bank leverage has been driven by deposits and therefore cannot be cured by reducing lending. In fact, the opposite would be true. If we had more loan growth, it would help because it would absorb excess risk based capital. The issue is that we've had muted loan demands to date. And even if it starts to pick up, it's hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further QE. And therefore we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time. And finally, when a bank is leveraged constraint, this lowers the marginal value of any deposits regardless if it is wholesale or retail, operational or non-operational and regulators to consider whether requiring banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome. As we told you last quarter, we have levers to manage SLR and we will, however, raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run. And then just to wrap up on capital regarding distribution, the limitations were extended another quarter. So based on our income that corresponds to buyback capacity of about $7.4 billion in the second quarter after paying our $0.90 dividend. Given the preferred, we plan to issue and the work underway around excess client deposits, while of course this could become more challenging, we believe that we should be able to buy back most if not all of that capacity. Now let's go to our businesses starting with consumer and community banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $6.7 billion including reserve releases of $4.6 billion. Starting with the key drivers of year-on-year financial performance, which I'll just note have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against the backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets, with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy de-leveraging. Deposit growth was 32% or $240 billion as existing customer balances remain elevated. And we also continue to acquire new customers. Client investment assets were up 44% driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. Home lending originations were $39 billion, up 40% and an overall larger market. And auto loan and lease originations were $11.2 billion, up 35%, with March being the best month on record. However, loans were down 7% as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to pre-COVID levels. This is in addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by PPP additions.  Mobile users grew 9% to nearly $42 million, and the customer migration to digital continued with brands transactions still down double digits. In consumer banking, approximately 50% of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally. And that's up more than 10 percentage points year-on-year. Notably, we're also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering. Consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels reflecting increased optimism. We've seen debit and credit cards been returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 9% year-on-year and 14% versus 1Q, 2019 despite T&E remaining significantly lower. That said we are seeing strong momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March compared to February, and similar growth across CX loyalty and ultimate reward travel bookings. With higher rates, mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed but the overall market is still robust. And on credit, government's stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough. Taken together with the pace of the vaccine rollout, we believe there's some permanent to the loss mitigation. And while 1Qm 2021 card losses are higher quarter-on- quarter, we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters. In summary, revenue of $12.5 billion was down 6% year-on-year driven by deposit margin compression and lower card NII and lower balances largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 1% as we self-fund our investment. And credit costs were a net benefit of $3.6 billion driven by the $4.6 billion of reserve releases I previously mentioned; partially offset by net charge- offs of a $1 billion. Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion and an ROE of 27% on record first quarter revenue of $14.6 billion. Investment banking revenue of $2.9 billion was up 67% year-on-year excluding the impact of the bridge bookmark down last year. IB fees of $3 billion were up 57% and while we nap ranked number two largely due to SPAC IPOs, we maintained our global IB wallet share of 9%. The quarter's performance was an all time record driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets, as well as robust activity in M&A and DCM. In advisory, we were up 35% benefiting from the surge and announcement activity in the second half of 2020. Debt underwriting fees were up 17% driven by leveraged finance activity, and here we maintained our number one rank and lead left position. And in equity underwriting fees were up more than 200% primarily driven by IPOs, as clients continue to take advantage of strong market conditions. Looking forward, the IPO calendar is expected to remain active with M&A momentum likely to continue. And while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline both this year and last year, make it difficult to predict the second quarter. So at this point, I'd say we expect IB fees to be about flat year-on-year. Moving to markets, total revenue was $9.1 billion, up 25% against a strong prior year quarter. In January and February, we saw a robust trading environment and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum from the end of 2020 carrying through to the start of the year. In March, our performance started to normalize but remained above pre-COVID levels. Fixed Income was up 15% with outperformance in securitized products and credit supported by active primary and secondary markets, partially offset by lower revenues and rates and currency and emerging markets against a tough compare in March of last year.  Equity markets was up 47% and an all time record driven by a favorable trading environment and equity derivatives as well as strong client activity across products. In terms of outlook based on recent weeks, we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of 2019 as to 2Q 2020 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise but obviously it's still early. Wholesale payments and security services revenues were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, both down 2% year-on-year with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 19% year-on-year on higher revenue related compensation, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $331 million driven by the reserve releases I discussed earlier. Now let's go to commercial banking on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.2 billion and an ROE of 19%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was up 11% year-on-year with higher lending in investment banking revenue and the absence of a prior year marked down in the bridge book partially offset by lower deposit revenue. Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.1 billion was up 65% with broad based strength as market conditions remain favorable. Expenses of $969 million were down 2% driven by lower structural expenses. Deposits of $291 billion were up 54% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter as client balances remain elevated. And loans were down 2% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were down 4% from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity, partially offset by additional PPP funding. And CRE loans were down 1% with continued low origination volumes and commercial term lending, partially offset by increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $118 million driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of $29 million driven by oil and gas. Now on to asset and wealth management on page 8. Asset and wealth management generated record net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 40% and ROE of 35%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year, as higher management fees, growth and deposit and loan balances as well as investment valuation gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 6% with higher volume and revenue related expenses, partially offset by lower structural expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $121 million primarily due to reserve releases. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows of $48 billion were again positive across all channels, asset classes and regions with particular strength and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $44 billion as banks encourage clients to move excess deposits away from them. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, up 28% and 32% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net inflows. And finally, deposits were up 43% and loans were up 18% with strength in security based lending, custom lending and mortgages. Now onto corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $580 million. Revenue was a loss of $473 million, down $639 million year-on-year. Net interest income was down nearly $700 million on lower rates as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth. And expenses of $876 million were up $730 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the contribution to the Foundation I mentioned earlier. The results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the Firm's expected full year tax rate relative to the level of pretax income this quarter. So with that, moving to the outlook on page 10. You'll see here that our 2021 and NII outlook have around $55 billion remains in line with our previous guidance, as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by customer behavior in card. It's worth noting that forecasting NII is perhaps more challenging than it's been in a long time, as many of the key inputs market, implied rates, deposit forecast, securities reinvestment and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid. And as a reminder, while customer de-leveraging in higher payment rates in card is a headwind for NII, it's a tailwind for credit. And we now expect our card net charge-off rate to be around 250 basis points for the year. And then on expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $70 billion with the largest driver being higher volume and revenue related expenses, which importantly have offsets in revenue. So to wrap up, the year has gotten off to a strong start and a robust economic recovery seems underway. Of course, there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that we're preparing for as well as specific issues that we're facing, including the balance sheet dynamics. I mentioned the rate environment and tough year-over-year comparisons, among other things. Having said that, the earnings power of the franchise remains evident, and we'll continue to use our resources to serve our clients, customers and communities. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ErikaNajarian: Hi, good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you believe that normalized ROTC for JPMorgan would be about 17%. And investors are wondering as we think about JPMorgan, perhaps cementing a higher GSIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that context or constraint? JenniferPiepszak: So, yes, so Erika, I'll start. So just a couple of things to think about on capital. So while we're, we ended the year in the 4% bucket for GSIB and it's probably worth mentioning, given the continued expansion of the system through the Fed's balance sheet, even staying in four could become challenging for us. But just a couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that like we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer, and we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models, but we've talked about things that actions that we've taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held to maturity that should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario dependent, but we do expect some benefit there that could offset. It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame. And the indication from the Fed is that they will address GSIB recalibration as part of that. And so it's quite possible that we see GSIB recalibration but perhaps another constraint that we will be managing. So there is a lot that we will learn over probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher GSIB it doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of 2023. So we do think we have offsets, we're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us, of course, given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what we're dealing with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be about loan demand 17% still feels achievable for us. ErikaNajarian: Got it. And thank you for going through, some of the leverage constraint now that SLR has been -- exemption has expired. Investors have also been wondering as we think about your opportunity to continue to facilitate the economic recovery globally, does the constraint on SLR and the moving pieces on GSIB change your priorities in terms of timing or sizing of the $30 billion buyback or, inorganic growth opportunities that you've mentioned in the past? JenniferPiepszak: I would say broadly speaking, no, but an important point there on SLR, we obviously, the levers we have are issuing preferred, we can retain more common, but we're also working closely with wholesale clients in a very selective way, as I mentioned, to find alternatives for excess deposits. So it is true that common is one of the levers although I will say that while it might give us more flexibility, it comes at a much greater cost. So at this point, given what we know and what we expect, we don't expect that we would have to retain more common. We think we can manage this through issuing more preferred and working closely with our clients to find alternatives. So I would say broadly speaking, no, the GSIB constraints, as we've been saying for years now is one that will become increasingly challenging for us and now particularly with the expansion of the system it's even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few years ago, but we're managing through that as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. JohnMcDonald: Hey, good morning, Jen. I want to ask about expenses. Obviously, you've raised the outlook by a $1 billion a few times, the last couple times you spoken. I guess in terms of the increase that you've announced today to the outlook, can you give a little more color on how much of that is volume and revenue related, as opposed to the other buckets you talked about in January, which were investments and structural? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So the increase from the $69 billion, which was the guidance we gave in the K, is almost entirely volume and revenue related. And so there, I'll just make an important point that it's volume and revenue related. So as an example, volumes in CCB, just given the environment, they are very valuable for long-term franchise revenue growth, but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term. But as we always say, we don't manage this place for one quarter or even one year. So there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth, you would anticipate over the long run, but it's almost entirely volume and revenue related. There are a few other things like marketing expense that given the strength of the recovery that we expect, we now expect to lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year. So that's part of it as well. JohnMcDonald: Okay, and I guess the follow up would be, is that necessarily mean that it's more concentrated the increase in the first quarter because you had such a big quarter? And are there COVID related costs that you have in your numbers this year that might come out over time? JenniferPiepszak: Obviously, some of it is in the first quarter, but things like further volume related expenses, like I talked about, or marketing, they're less so in the first quarter. And then what was your other question? JohnMcDonald: COVID. JenniferPiepszak: Oh, those numbers are lower than they were even last year and yes included in the outlook but not material in the grand scheme of things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. GlennSchorr: Hello there. So, if you're right on the economy, which I think a lot of us think you are, we're starting to see the spend part of the pickup now, as you mentioned, across credit and debit, and some of the [T&E] [ph]. So my question is, how do you think about the staging of the lend part? Both consumer corporates are so flush with all that liquidity. Have you think about the timing for loan growth? And if I could get a consumer versus wholesale comment that would be great. JenniferPiepszak: Sure, so you use the right word, which is demand. And it really is all about demand, which of course is quite healthy, particularly as it relates to the consumer, when you think about the amount of deleveraging that we've seen through this process. So there we do expect a second half pickup, because as you say, we first have to see spend recover before we see re-levering on the consumer side. So and then it is also true even for small business, which is obviously part of CCB, their demand has been very low, given the support that's available through PPP. And so that will likely pick up in the second half as well. And then elsewhere, AWM has been strong throughout. And we see that continuing. And then on the CIB side, I mean, that's always lumpy and deal dependent. But that's active as well. And we do see within secured lending opportunities there across asset classes, again, that's a bit more opportunistic. And then in the commercial bank, given the level of support the amount of liquidity in the markets, as well as the amount of cash on balance sheets, loan growth, there has been muted and probably will be for some time, but again, that's incredibly healthy, ultimately for their recovery. And so whether we see that pickup later this year, or next year, remains to be seen, but it's all for good reasons. GlennSchorr: I appreciate that. And maybe I'll just ask one follow up on the deposit side, obviously, deposit growth has been incredibly strong. So the two parter is what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy goes down the path that you've outlined, and what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime because I saw a loud and clear Jamie comments on it's hard to justify the price of US debt. So what we are doing with all that liquidity in the meantime? JenniferPiepszak: So first of all, I would say that deposits are going to be driven by the Fed's balance sheet. And to some extent, obviously, by bank lending, but given the demand picture there, you can think of it in the near term as all being driven by Fed balance sheet expansion. And so we obviously continue to expect significant deposit growth, which is why we've been talking about this so much. And then just in terms of how we deploy it, you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarter-over-quarter. And there, it's just important to remember that for sure we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio that is true. I'll also mention that we are -- because of the steepening of the yield curve, we are less short, and banks will drift long in a sell off. And so that has been part of the dynamic as well, but they are short term cash deployment also. And so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below IOER, we're going to hold that short term cash deployment in IOER relative to the repo market. So you'll see that dynamic on our balance sheet, as well. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. KenUsdin: Hey, Jen thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to elaborate on that. You mentioned the record investment banking pipeline, and flattish year-over-year is the best guess. So I was just wondering if you could talk about the mix dynamics there. Obviously, the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ECM markets. And can you just give us a flavor of just where you see activity? And how much is that underwriting activity, potentially dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side? JenniferPiepszak: Well, I'll start with the latter, which is, it's absolutely been very, very supportive of corporates, and therefore it has a lot to do with what we're seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates. And then in terms of the mix, we expect ECM and M&A to continue. But on DCM there's a lot of flow activity that doesn't necessarily get represented in a pipeline because it's high velocity type activity. We saw that in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see that now, which is why I said it makes it a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter so that while the pipeline is higher than it's ever been, there is still a lot of high velocity activity. And so that's why we think that the quarter will be flattish year-over-year despite the very high pipeline. JamieDimon: Do you guys hear me? JenniferPiepszak: Yes. JamieDimon: Because we can't hear you anymore. Oh. And I'm gonna put you on mute for a minute. JenniferPiepszak: Okay. Jamie's traveling, so we have him on zoom. I know everybody can appreciate technology challenges, because we've all had them over the last year. KenUsdin: Okay, great, Jen. And my just -- my follow up -- JamieDimon: Jen, just keep on going because I can't hear the questions. I can't hear you. But you're doing a great job, and you don't really need me JenniferPiepszak : Well, thank you. I'm sure I'll need you at some point. So hope they're on that. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry. KenUsdin: Yes, no problem, Jen. Okay, so the second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have made for a while about looking at acquisition opportunities. Just wondering just how is the interplay between everything you've talked about already on balance sheet capacity, and ongoing deposit growth and limitations on CET1 and SLR versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital and an acquisition capacity? JenniferPiepszak: Yes, it's a great question. Interestingly, the issue is not that we don't have capital available to make those types of decisions. The issue is that we have the wrong binding constraints. So the binding constraint is leverage not risk based. And so it doesn't change the way we think about acquisitions at all. In fact, acquisitions and/or increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and risk based. And so we would love to be able to absorb some of our CET1 through acquisitions, because as I said, it sort of just brings the balance back into focus. The issue is that that it's leverage base constraint, that is the constraint and we're in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth. So it's the combination of all those things that make leverage the binding constraint. But it doesn't change the way we're thinking about acquisitions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: Hey, Jen. Hey, thanks for the time. Jen, a question on card and looking at the net charge-off. You've gave us the full year of 2.5% and I know you spent a lot of time in card earlier in your career. So maybe you could give us some sense on how you're thinking about the quote unquote normalization of that loss content over time. When I think back to the bankruptcy, changes in the 00's, it took many years for consumers to relapse. And I'm wondering, given your background there, could you give us a sense as to what is different this time? And are there timeframes historically, we should look at or what a normal course like re-leveraging back to normal of that card loss content should be? How do you think about that? JenniferPiepszak: Sure, I would say this; first of all, it's difficult to find a historical comparison that's totally relevant here. Because I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support in the system, which came, of course, on top of an already reasonably healthy consumer. So it's difficult to find the historical perspective, but I will say the 2.5%, I mean, pre-COVID, we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been 3.3%, 3.5%. So it just gives you a sense there of that tailwind on credit is significant. And in terms of, what it's going to take for consumers to re-lever, I mean, we do expect there to be significant economic activity in the second half. And so that could come quite naturally. But it could come a little bit later, given the amount of deleveraging we've seen, but the fact that we already see spend above pre-COVID levels, and obviously, we still have restrictions in place, particularly around T&E on consumers ability to spend. When that comes back, we do think that we'll see spend tick even higher. And that will be a point where perhaps we'll start to see that re-levering. But it is difficult to know, it's a great question. BetsyGraseck: Okay. And then the follow up I have on your comments around the NII guide. And the fact that it's hard to forecast. I got a couple of questions in this morning just on hey, why do you think it's flat versus prior guide given the curve has steepened? And also, deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given QE is continuing this full year? So is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is it more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified? JenniferPiepszak: Sure, I think it's probably all the above, Betsy, but starting with the steepening of the yield curve. So if you look at the earnings at risk disclosure, I mean, we are -- we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is, since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25-30 basis points. So that is incorporated in the outlook. But it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates. And we haven't started to see re-levering as we were just talking about, even though spends has recovered. So card, the impacts of card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve; you also mentioned loan growth, which is, critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve. And then I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook, the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small, given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal. And so, you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points, because we do have pay rates above zero, so it's something less than 10 basis points. So the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot in this environment anyway. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hey, Jennifer. My question is for Jamie. And Jamie, your philosophy is to invest through a downturn, and you're increasing your investments by one fourth year-over-year, you already said that. But what's your philosophy about investing through a boom as you expect over the next three years? I mean, if the pie is growing, do your investments go higher? It looks like that's not the case with the guidance you guys gave. JamieDimon: So I think, Mike, the way to really look at it as it might doesn't -- it doesn't affected a much by boom and bust as you think. So we isolate opportunities like for -- so now we're going to hire 300 black financial advisors, we're going to do that whether it's boom or bust. We're building new data centers. We're building new agile, we're going to the cloud, so I think it doesn't really paying that much over time. I just think you're probably seeing our investment go up over time not go down. We get plenty of organic growth opportunities, which we want to invest in. MikeMayo: And then how much you spending in climate? Your 66 pages CEO letter was, I guess that's like a -- could be a third of a book almost. But you really had the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do, how much you actually spending? And what's the payback on that spending for shareholders? Or is this really an ESG reputational benefit you're looking for? JenniferPiepszak: So I'll start there, Mike, and then Jamie, you can chime in. But climate is a long game, obviously. And we're investing a lot of effort in our ESG initiatives, not only because they have a positive impact on society and communities, but because they're also important to our clients, customers and our shareholders. So we don't exactly think about it that way, Mike. But we've also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the transition. And we do recognize it's a transition and clients appreciate that. We've also made the Paris aligned financing commitment last year, and we're going to release our annual ESG report next month. So you'll see more there. And then we also committed to finance $200 billion towards climate action and sustainable development. And we're continuing to grow those efforts as well. And in fact, your questions quite timely, because we're planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about long-term scaling of our financing efforts here. So much more detail to come shortly on that. But Jamie, I don't know if you want to add anything. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. JimMitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe just maybe a question on the bank SLR which I think was a bit more of a constraint even than the Firmwide SLR? Just I guess, two questions related to that. What kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage the difference between the two moving assets out of the bank perhaps? And then just if you have any updates or thoughts on potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe relief 2.0 in a more permanent sense on the SLR? JenniferPiepszak: So the bank SLR, I mean, broadly speaking, it's going to be the same levers, we do have a little bit more flexibility, as you note, because we can move things, we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company. So it's a little bit more flexible, but generally speaking, the constraints and the levers are the same. And then in terms of changes, we know what you know. And so, we look forward to our proposal, the only thing I can mention is, of course, the difference between the US and Europe on Basel as it relates to SLR is there, it's 3% plus half year, GSIB. And so we have a constant 2% buffer. And so -- and with that, you get the flexibility in a Basel compliant way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time. So it's possible that it could look something like that, but we don't know. JimMitchell: Okay, thanks. JamieDimon: So I think there is too much focus there. We run the business, do a great job servicing clients over time, we manage 20 years. If I, god knows how many different capital liquidity contents. We have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients. If we've got to adjust our strategy going forward, so be it, we'll probably be fine. I think the question you should be asking isn't what it means for us, is what it means the marketplace. I've already mentioned several times we have $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways into the marketplace with repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these constraints. So the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on JPMorgan Chase. We will find a way regardless of any constraints to do things. The other thing GSIB SLR, they're always bubble thing. They need to be recalibrated. And I think people have been asking why how would you recalibrate to do the best job for the United States and the people of United States not for JPMorgan? JPMorgan is going to be fine either way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. GerardCassidy: Hi, Jen, how are you? Question, I apologize if you address this. I had to jump off for a minute here. But can you share with us on the service -- mortgage servicing business? It looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Can you tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded a small loss? JenniferPiepszak: Oh, gosh, Gerard. Not even sure. But Reggie and the team can follow up with you. GerardCassidy: Okay, very good. The second question has to do with when we go back to the day one, loan loss reserves, established in January 1, 2020 for you and your peers under CECL accounting. If I recall, I think your loan loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately 1.87%. Today, they're approximately 2.42%. I know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like you being a little more conservative. But can you share with us what would it take to bring the reserves back down to the day one levels that we saw in January 1, 2020? JenniferPiepszak: Well, it's very difficult to try to compare today to just taking our balance sheet today, taking the profile of our portfolio today and compare it to CECL day one, because we are a very far away from that, in fact, in a very healthy way. So that's very difficult to do. What I will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first quarter. And we obviously expect things to be, we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the year. And so if we continue to see that, if we continue to see labor markets recover, if we continue to see the vaccine rollout be successful, we would have future releases from here. And but I would note importantly, that the $7 billion that is the distance between our reserve and the base case is just for context, we will always have weightings on alternative scenarios. And so all else equal, which is there's a lot in the all else equal bucket. But we would release something less than $7 billion so difficult to compare back to CECL day one, but there could be further releases ahead. JamieDimon: Yes. One of the negatives to CECL, which I pointed out, right in the beginning that we spend a lot of time on these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank, which is these are multiple scenarios, hypothetical probability based, and obviously, the more volatile environments and more volatile these numbers, if a base case was $20 billion, and we now have something like $30 billion, we're not going to be taking down a lot of reserves now, because you're always, As Jen said, you are always going to have extreme adverse case. Think of it like kind CCAR test, you always have a percentage of reserves up for that permanently. And so always and hopefully, I mean, my view is we should waste a lot less time on CECL that makes almost no difference to the company in general. JenniferPiepszak: And then back on your servicing point, I got the answer. It's updates to the MSR model. So HPI updates, prepay updates. So it's less about the operation and more about the MSR model update. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MattO'Connor: Good morning, I wanted to ask about the CEO letter where there was talk about being open to FinTech deals, which is something you've talked about in the past. But what type of deals would you be interested in? And I guess it could be material to JPMorgan as we think about whether it's a strategy or financial impact? JamieDimon: So remember, we're after paying a steady, careful dividend and stuff like. You might prefer to invest in our business organically, including the acquisitions than buyback stock. We're buying back stock because our cup run is over. We have 13.6% capital to risk weighted, advanced risk weighted assets. We're earning a tremendous sum of money, and we really have no option right now. But I think the door is open to anything that makes sense. So we've already done InstaMed, which is an electronic digital payment platform between providers and consumers in health care. We did 55 IP which is a tax way of -- a tax efficient way of managing money. And we're looking at tons of things ourselves. Some we're doing ourselves like dynamo. Some are going to partner with other people. We've got investments and probably 100 different companies are going to be a partner with or like. So we're completely open minded. It could be payments, it could be asset management, it could be an agency, it could data, and it could be anything like that. It cannot be a US Bank. So we're just reminding people if you got great ideas for us, let us know. MattO'Connor: And as the mentality and FinTech specifically is that to potentially accelerate some of the investments that you would have done on your own or to add capabilities, or maybe to protect what you already have? JamieDimon: Well, it's a little of everything because you see us adding Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan and obviously, see competing a little bit buy now pay later, you see us doing Chase Offers and compete with people, you see us doing Zelle payments, we got tons of fabulous stuff coming. We did do invest a couple of years ago and had a very good quarter, we're ending Robo investing, which is just getting going. So we're adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum. And you're going to see a lot more, and you're going to see personalization apps. If you go into the payment system, you can see, global wallets, you can see tons of stuff is coming in. Like I said, the FinTech has done a great job. And I pointed out that they live under different constraints. But they've done a great job, getting rid of pain points, making full automated digitizing things using the cloud. It's incumbent upon us to go faster the cloud; we already have 115 major AI projects. But my guess is in five years, it'll be 1,000 AI projects. So we're going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers. And obviously, FinTech is -- it will be a challenge; there's a lot of money there. They're very smart people. I want to be clear, we're not wishing regulations on them like I'm not, and I think they are to be bad for America. But we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes around certain products and certain services. Now I for one thing it's grossly unfair, that a neo bank could have a small checking account, earn $200, in Durbin fees, and we earn $100, that just isn't right. And I go on and on and on about some of the unfair things, but let the regulars do it. I'm not expecting any change. We'll just adjust our strategies accordingly. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. BrianKleinhanzl: Hey, Good morning. I just have a quick question. I mean, as we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of implying Fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term? I mean how are you guys thinking about the positive beta this cycle and kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity both on the consumer and commercial deposits? Thanks. JamieDimon: So I think the way to answer is the betas have gamma mean, they change over time. And we have our best guess and numbers that Jen gave you. So obviously, the beta is going up all the time. And then it levels off. JenniferPiepszak: That's right. And so the betas have gamma. Like, I'd say that if you can think of it as being nonlinear, meaning the beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of 100 basis points. And so from here, on the retail side, specifically, the first 100 basis points will be very valuable, because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales Partners. CharlesPeabody: Hello, can you hear me? JenniferPiepszak: Yes, we can hear you go ahead. CharlesPeabody: Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might have on your entity. Specifically, if we -- you touched a little bit on IOR rate and the overnight repo rate being raised. Would that have any impacts on your market related NII, we had to raise by five basis points. Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated in your $55 billion NII guidance? And then thirdly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications for what loan demand might look like? Thank you. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So I'll just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been orderly and so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time or and we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more. I think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Fed increased their RRP facility. Now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any meaningful period of time, they also obviously could increase that. And then for us, I would say not a meaningful impact because obviously we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us. But we do trade around it. JamieDimon: And I would just add, the why is far more important than the number like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and out, the whole thing have been equal, no, it just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative in NII because you're going back into recession, because there's a negative variance, that's a whole different issue, than if it's a temporary timing thing, I will tell you, we would expect rates moving up over time, we expect a rather healthy and very strong economy. JenniferPiepszak: Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. AndrewLim: Hi, Jen, Jamie, morning. So just circling back to the SLR. Despite issuing $1.5 billion preferred, you saw last about 30 basis points on your SLR. I am just wondering how you think about the ratio to three quarters out from now. Whether issuing preferred and having a discussion with wholesale depositors is going to be enough to put a flow on that SLR at 5.5% or whether you can have to pull harder on those levers or have to pull hard on other levers? JenniferPiepszak: Yes. So the minimum is 5%. So we have some room, naturally, we will have a buffer above the minimum as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going. So you can think about some management buffer above that. But we do still have room at 5.5%. And we do think that we can manage this at this point through issuing will be in the market again, with preferred, as well as the conversations that we've had with clients. So far, they have not been disruptive. We're hopeful that remains the case and that we can manage this. AndrewLim: Okay, so what's your level of concept for the buffer above the 5%? And that's my follow up. And then just another question. You gave an update, a couple of quarters guys saying that you had a buffer of, or let's say excess proficiency of about $10 billion versus your best case scenario, economic outlook. Obviously, you've released a lot of provisions since then. Can you give an update on what that figure is now? JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So you can think about a buffer on the SLR of call it 25 basis points. There -- it is important to note, something like AOCI is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of AOCI is that's part of Tier 1 capital. So we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there. So that's why we have a buffer and 25 basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about. In terms of the on reserves, the distance between where we are in the base case, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's now $7 billion. What's interesting to note is that that was $10 billion, it was then $9 billion, and we've released $8 billion and it's still $7 billion. So the all of the scenarios have been moving. And there are a lot that goes into how we think about reserves; we've always just provided that as context for everyone, particularly last year as we were managing through so much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that. Because what I also said, on the $7 billion is that you shouldn't think about that as available for release, because we will always have some waiting on alternative scenarios. And so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect, based upon where we closed the books for the first quarter, it would be something less than $7 billion. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security. MikeMayo: Hi, I'm still wrestling with the deposit conundrum. So I guess your national deposit share is something like 12%. And over the last year, I think your incremental deposit share gain is 20%. And in others, the industry deposits are up around $3 trillion and your deposits are up to $600 billion. So I'm just wondering how much of that was due to QE and how much of that is due to organic growth. And maybe you can fill us in because you're building out the branches in the lower 48 states. And you're expanding commercial bankers and try to build up all this organic growth at a time when you can't really monetize those deposits. Thanks. JenniferPiepszak: Sure. So first of all, as we always say, we're running the place for the long term. And we don't expect this challenge to be a long-term challenge, maybe a short to medium term, but not a long term. And then I'll just say that, yes, there was certainly some organic growth, but it is Fed balance sheets and bank lending that create deposits. And so that's what we are focused on. And we do think given what we expect here that we can manage it. So and it certainly isn't going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise, is that is long term franchise value. JamieDimon: I think Jen another just kind of -- I think Mike the $600 billion and it's really hard -- yes, we think we're growing actual share in almost every business deposits. But $500 billion to $600 billion was the Fed balance sheet. And we're a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank. So obviously a big portion that shows up inside our company. And, again, we try to -- the new branch is doing great, but they're not going to move the needle quite like the Fed, adding $3 trillion to deposit in the system. JenniferPiepszak: That's right. MikeMayo: And just a quick update on the build out into the 48 lower states branches, you said by the middle of this year. JenniferPiepszak: Yes. So we'll be in all lower 48 by the end of July. Is that right? Yes, Reggie is confirming for me. We will be in all lower 48 by the end of July. We opened about 75 branches in market expansion last year; we got a little bit slowed down by COVID. But that's going to be about 150 this year. So remain super excited about that. And all the opportunities that bring across the company not just in deposits, of course, because it brings incredible value to the commercial bank into the private bank. And so the business case there, if you will, is not just about deposits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ErikaNajarian: Hi. Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. Just wanted to react the first question another way, it seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the GSIB for some time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue generation and market share taking in some opportunities. And so investors are wondering, if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful, and that CET1 floor does have to move up from 12%. What is the sensitivity of the normalized, what's the outlook, if any at all if that 12% does have to move up in 50 basis points increment? JenniferPiepszak: Okay, so if the 12% has to move up, Erika that would obviously have an impact. But there is so much between here and there, and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only I know we've been waiting for GSIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that GSIB recalibration will be part of the Basel III endgame which we have also been waiting for a very long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we yet are not -- we were unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet. So we continue to wait for Basel III endgame. And then as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to GSIB constraints. So we're thinking about that 12% number until we know something's different. JamieDimon: And I would just add, we're going to finally try to keep at 12% and we're pretty sure we can do it. So I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up, like if we're earning 20% tangible equity, and our capital goes up by 5%. And we get no return on the 5%; our ROE goes to 19%. So I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great and you have slight low returns. But I even think that will be temporary, we will over time find strategies and tactics to get referred to the federal shareholders. But the most importantly about those returns we have great business. Great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service, good app, the control is good. And that's what we really build all the time. It is other stuffs that just managing around capitals and franchise. It's a shame that this, I mean, this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We are spending time and are calling CECL and SLR and it's a shame and it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over we have one -- we have $2.2 trillion deposits, $1 trillion loans, $1.5 trillion cash and marketable securities. Much of it would cannot be deployed intermediate or lend. How conservative do you want to get? JenniferPiepszak: No, I agree. I think the market needed to hear that. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Jennifer Piepszak : Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thanks, operator. Jamie Dimon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Before we get going, I\u2019d just like to say how honored I am to be on my first earnings call following the footsteps of Marianne and Jen, both of whom taught me so much during my time working for them and whose shoes will be very difficult to fill, but I'm going to try. So with that, this presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page one. The Firm reported net income of $11.9 billion, EPS of $3.78 on revenue of $31.4 billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These results include $3 billion of credit reserve releases, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Touching on a few highlights. Combined debit and credit spend was up 45% year on year and more importantly up 22% versus the more normal pre-COVID second quarter of 2019. It was an all-time record for IB fees, up 25% year on year, driven by advisory and debt underwriting. We saw particularly strong growth in AWM with record long-term flows as well as record revenue. And finally, credit continues to be quite healthy as evidenced by our exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. Regarding our balance sheet, the trends from recent quarters have largely continued. Deposits are up 23% year on year and 4% sequentially, and loan growth remains low, flat year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, although we have bright spots in certain pockets, and the consumer spend trends are encouraging. So, now turning to page 2 for more detail. As I go through this page, I'm going to provide you some context about the prior-year quarter because the year-on-year comparisons are a bit noisy. So, with respect to revenue, the second quarter of 2020 was an all-time record for markets with revenue of over $9.7 billion, and we recorded approximately $700 million of gains in our bridge book. With that in mind, revenue of $31.4 billion was down $2.4 billion or 7% year-on-year. Non-interest revenue was down $1.3 billion or 7% due to the prior year items I just mentioned, partially offset by strong fee generation in Investment Banking and AWM as well as from card-related fees on higher spend. And net interest income was down $1.1 billion or 8%, driven by lower markets NII and lower balances in card. Expenses of $17.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, largely on continued investments. And then on credit costs, going back to last year again, you will recall, in last year's second quarter, we built $8.9 billion in credit reserves during the height of the pandemic, whereas this year, we released $3 billion. So in this quarter, credit costs were a net benefit of $2.3 billion. And setting aside the reserve release, it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $700 million were half of last year's second quarter number and continue to trend near historical lows. On the next page, let's go over the reserves. We released $3 billion this quarter as we grow increasingly confident about the economy in light of continued improvement in COVID, especially in the U.S. In Consumer, we released $2.6 billion, including $1.8 billion in Card and $600 million in Home Lending. And in Wholesale, we released nearly $450 million. So, this leaves us with reserves of $22.6 billion, which as a result of elevated remaining uncertainty about COVID and the shape of the economic recovery are higher than would otherwise be implied by our central economic forecasts. Now, moving to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, down slightly versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was more than offset by higher RWA across both retail and wholesale lending. This quarter also reflects the expiration of the temporary SLR exclusions. And as we anticipated, leverage is now a binding constraint. As you know, we finished CCAR a couple of weeks ago and our SCB will be 3.2%, which reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the third quarter. Okay, now let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 5. CCB reported net income of $5.6 billion, including reserve releases of $2.6 billion on revenue of $12.8 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Of particular note this quarter is the acceleration of card spend. And so, while card outstandings remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, this quarter's trends made us optimistic. Total debit and credit spend was up 45% year-on-year, and more importantly, up 22% versus the second quarter of '19. And within that, compared to 2019, June total spend was up 24%, indicating some healthy acceleration throughout the quarter. And travel and entertainment has really turned the corner with spend flat versus the second quarter of '19, accelerating from down 11% in April to actually up 13% in June. The rest of the CCB story remains consistent with prior quarters. Consumer and small business cash balances remain elevated, resulting in depressed loan growth. Overall loans were down 3% year-on-year from continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and on lower card outstandings, partially offset by strong growth in Auto and the impact of PPP. Home Lending and Auto continued to have strong originations with Home Lending up 64% to $40 billion, the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of 2013, and Auto up 61% to a record $12.4 billion. Deposits were up 25% year-on-year or approximately $200 billion, and client investment assets were up 36%, driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels. And our omnichannel strategy continues to deliver. We are more than halfway through our initial market expansion commitment as we have opened more than 200 new branches out of our goal of 400, which have exceeded our expectations by generating $7 billion in deposits and investments. And we are planning to be in all 48 contiguous states by the end of the summer. Digital trends continue to be strong as retail mobility recovers at a faster pace than branch transactions, which are still down more than 20% versus 2019. Active mobile users grew 10% year-on-year to over 42 million, and total digital transactions per engaged customer were up 12%. Expenses of $7.1 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Looking forward, the obvious question is the outlook for loan growth, especially in card. And we are quite optimistic that the current spend trends will convert into resumption of loan growth through the end of this year and into next. And while we wait, the exceptionally low level of net charge-offs provides a substantial offset to the NII headwind. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $5 billion and an ROE of 23% on revenue of $13.2 billion. IB fees of $3.6 billion were up 25% year-on-year and up 20% quarter-on-quarter, an all-time record, driven by advisory and debt underwriting, leading to a year-to-date global IB wallet share of 9.4% and a number 1 ranking. In advisory, we were up 52% year-on-year, benefiting from the surge in announcement activity that has continued into the second quarter. Debt underwriting fees were up 26%, driven by an active acquisition finance market, offset by lower investment-grade issuance. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 9%, primarily driven by a strong performance in IPOs. The resulting Investment Banking revenue of $3.4 billion was roughly flat year-on-year due to the headwind of the prior year's markup in the bridge book. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the pipeline remains very strong. We expect M&A activity and the IPO market to remain active. And while IB fees are likely to be down sequentially, we still expect them to be up year-on-year. Moving to markets. Total revenue was $6.8 billion, down 30% compared to an all-time record quarter last year. While normalization has been more prevalent in macro, overall, we ran above 2019 levels throughout the quarter on the back of strong client activity, outperforming our own expectations from earlier in the year. Fixed income was down 44% compared to last year's exceptional results, but up 11% compared to the second quarter of '19. Equity markets was up 13%, driven by record balances in prime as well as strong performance in cash and equity derivatives, where we matched last year's great results. Looking forward, while we expect normalization to continue across both, Investment Banking and markets, and most notably in fixed income, the timing and the extent of the normalization is obviously hard to predict. Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% driven by higher deposits and fees, largely offset by deposit margin compression. And security services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1%, as deposit margin compression was predominantly offset by growth in deposits and fees. Expenses of $6.5 billion were down 4% year-on-year, driven by lower performance-related compensation, partially offset by higher volume-related expense. Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 3% year-on-year with higher Investment Banking, Lending and Wholesale Payments revenue, largely offset by lower deposit revenue and the absence of a prior year equity investment gain. Record gross Investment Banking revenue of $1.2 billion was up 37% on increased M&A and acquisition-related financing activity compared to prior year lows. Expenses of $981 million were up 10% year-on-year, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses and investments. Deposits of $290 billion were up 22% year-on-year as client balances remain elevated. Loans of $2.5 billion were down 12% year-on-year, driven by lower revolver utilization compared to the prior year quarter and down 1% sequentially. C&I loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter with lower utilization, partially offset by new loan activity in middle market. And CRE loans were down 1%, but we saw pockets of growth in affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $377 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point. And to complete our lines of business, on to Asset & Wealth Management on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37% and an ROE of 32%. Record revenue of $4.1 billion was up 20% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 11% year-on-year driven by higher performance-related compensation and distribution expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $49 billion continued to be positive across all channels, with notable strength in equities, fixed income and alternatives. AUM was $3 trillion. And for the first time, overall client assets were over $4 trillion, up 21% and 25% year-on-year, respectively, driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 21% year-on-year, with continued strength in securities-based lending, custom lending and mortgages, while deposits were up 37%. Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. Revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, down $415 million year-on-year. NII was down $274 million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued, and we realized $155 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter. Expenses of $515 million were up $368 million year-on-year. So with that, on page 10, the outlook. Our 2021 NII outlook of around $52.5 billion remains in line with the updated guidance we provided last month. But, as you'll note, we've also lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to less than 250 basis points, which, as I mentioned in CCB, provides a meaningful offset to the NII headwind. And it's worth mentioning that the current environment makes forecasting NII even in the near term unusually challenging. So, while $52.5 billion remains our current central case, you should expect some elevated uncertainty around that number, not only because of the ongoing impact of stimulus on consumer balance sheets, but also due to volatility coming from markets, among other things. And as a reminder, most of any fluctuation in markets NII, whether up or down, is likely to be offset in NIR. On expenses, we've increased our guidance to approximately $71 billion, driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses. So, to wrap up, we are encouraged by the continued progress against the virus and the economic recovery that is underway, especially in the United States. Although we want to acknowledge the challenges that much of the rest of the world is facing and we're hopeful that a global recovery will follow closely behind. Our performance this quarter once again showcases the power of our diversified business model as headwinds in NII from consumer delevering are offset by strong fee generation across AWM and CIB, and exceptionally low net charge-offs across the board. While we're proud of the performance of the Company and of our people through the crisis, the competition in every business from banks, fintechs and others is as intense as ever. So, as we look forward to an increasingly normal environment, we are enthusiastically focused on competing for every piece of share in every market, product and business where we operate and making the necessary investments to win. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Jeremy Barnum : Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi there. Hi Jeremy. Welcome. Welcome to the party. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you very much. Glenn Schorr : Question on NII if I could, and I apologize if it's a little multifaceted. But so even though we're getting some inflationary data and you're possibly inclined on economy as it might, rates fell. I'm not sure you want to opine on why, but let's talk about you kept the NII guide, I'm assuming, because deposit growth is strong. Curious your thoughts on consumer payment rates staying at this elevated level, deposit growth staying at this elevated level? And then most importantly, if you're managing the balance sheet any differently, meaning you had been slow playing putting money to work, rates are even lower now, are you still slow playing putting money to work? I appreciate it. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. All right. So, let's sort of take that in parts. So, in terms of our NII guidance, so yes, so we're reiterating $52.5 billion for the full year. So, just to take your deployment point first, obviously, rates are a little bit lower, long end rates are a bit lower. The curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance. But when we provided that guidance, we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year. So, as a result of that, it's not really a meaningful factor sort of at the level of precision that we\u2019re talking about here. In terms of the consumer side, as you say, obviously it's really card is really going to be the big driver. So, you heard us talking about payment rates, and you see the sequential growth in card loans. So, we do believe that the sort of acceleration in the pickup in spend is going to translate to, as I say, a resumption of loan growth in card. But, we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year. So, as a result, we don't really see revolving interest-bearing balances increasing meaningfully this year. And so, as a result, that remains a headwind for the overall NII for this year, which is incorporated in the outlook. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then, in terms of managing balance sheet any differently in terms of putting money to work, are you still conservative on that front? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Look, I mean, I think you've heard us talk about this before, right? So, our central case, from an economic perspective, is for a very robust recovery. And that's pretty much a consensus view between us, our research team, the Fed, et cetera. And that view is associated with higher inflation, along the lines of the Fed's own targets for higher inflation. All those things together -- it's an outlook that's associated with higher rates, all else equal. And so, in light of all that, we do remain happy to stay patient here. And if you look at our EIR disclosure, which you obviously won't see until you get the Q, but some of you guys have written about this recently, our overall sensitivities here are kind of in line with the industry. So when you consider kind of the tail type things that Jamie always talks about, the complexity of the balance sheet and various other factors, we do still feel that being patient here makes sense. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And just one quickie on the recent both acquisitions and investments, and you or Jamie could feel free to take it. I'm curious on A, big picture, is it just coincidence that there's been five things within a very short period of time? And maybe if you want to expand on maybe net mix specifically and why the change in terms of shying away from international expansion in the past and now making a little bit better move in. I appreciate it. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Sure, Glenn. So, let me start with the international expansion point on the consumer side because that's interesting. You've heard Jamie over the years talk about why it wouldn't really make sense to do international expansion in consumer when you think about that through the lens of branch-based strategy. So, if you imagine, going outside of the U.S. and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents, just from a branding perspective, from an operating leverage perspective, we've never felt that, that was likely to be a successful strategy for us, and that hasn't really changed. The difference right now is the ability to do that digital. So, what's really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative both in the UK and now with our recent investment in C6 in Brazil, is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit. Obviously, it's a strategically compelling opportunity. Brazil, as you probably know, is like the third biggest consumer banking market in the world, but it's kind of fun to be the disruptor. And so, I think for us, given our position in consumer banking in the United States, being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels, we see it among other things, in addition to being compelling financially, as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside. So, we're very excited about that stuff. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask you about capital. You mentioned leverage is now the binding constraint. And Jen has previously talked about a 12% CET1 target. I guess, could you talk about the multiple variables that you're balancing as you guys decide what capital levels to run at? You've got a rising G-SIB score, an SLR cushion that's shrinking, but maybe the rules get revised. And obviously, in SCB, that came down a little bit, but maybe you're hoping for more. How are you wrapping that all together into what kind of capital levels to target? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. It's a good question, John, and yes, there are a lot of variables. So, let me start by saying that in terms of a 12% target, it's not off the table is what I'll say about that, meaning 12%, it's not necessarily -- doesn't necessarily need to be higher. So for now, it's not off the table. But, the element of time, i.e. when are we bound by what, matters quite a bit as you think about this. So, just to go through some of the pieces, you've noted the GSIB point. So, we're in the 4% bucket now as of the end of last year. That comes into play in 2023. We're currently operating in 4.5. As you know, that's quite a seasonal number. So, it's still possible to get under 4.5 for the end of this year. But, we have to acknowledge an elevated probability, I would say, of landing in 4.5 bucket this year. But, the 4.5 bucket would be binding in 2024. And as you noted, in the meantime, we're bound by SLR. And we've been quite public about our views about these things, about the extent to which, increasingly, our capital requirements are driven by non-risk sensitive size-based measures, which were really designed, especially in the case of SLR, as backstops, which the Fed has acknowledged. So, our priority right -- and the Fed has talked about potentially addressing some of these things. We know we're waiting for an NPR on SLR, but also, they've said that a potential G-SIB fix could come as part of the holistic implementation of the Basel III end game. So, there's a lot of things that are going to play out between now and some of those minimums becoming binding. And realistically, right now, we're going to be operating above 12% anyway in light of the leverage bound in all likelihood. So, we're managing a variety of different factors, near term, short term, props, common, et cetera. And we're just going to try to be nimble about it as more information comes out over the next few quarters. Jamie Dimon : If I could make a further point, we have tons of capital, $200 billion of CET1, $35 billion of preferred, $300 billion of long-term debt, only $1 trillion of loans, which is the riskiest asset we have, and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities. So, the underlying thing is there's just tons of capital in the system. And I think one day, if you\u2019re going to look at and say, why so much, to the liquid side. John McDonald : Yes. And then, a quick follow-up, Jeremy, on expenses. You revised the fiscal year '21 outlook upward a few times now. Could you give a little more detail on the business volumes and revenues that are driving this? And also, we hear a lot about inflation across the economy. Are we seeing broader inflation play a role in your Company's expenses and outlook? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, a couple of things there. So yes, as you note, we have revised up from 70 to 71. And the biggest single driver there is volume and revenue-related expense, where if you -- it is tough. Well, it's... Jamie Dimon : The comp, we're going to be competitive in comp no matter what it takes. Let's keep that at the back of your mind. Jeremy Barnum : It is a little bit of comp. It's also transaction-related volumes. It's also marketing expense in certain pockets. So, it's all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenue-related. And I think the point is obviously, we're all a little bit focused on the NII headwinds right now. But from an NIR [ph] perspective, across markets, AWM, IB, CIB in general and even pockets, wealth management and CCB, we're actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were built into our prior expense guidance. So that's kind of the dynamic there. In terms of inflation, I would say that we're not seeing inflation in our actuals. But obviously, your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future, but it would be reasonable to assume that that's going to be a little bit of a challenge to a greater or lesser degree if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment. And we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the 71 for this year. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Jeremy, if I could just follow up on your points about capital. And just how we should be thinking about -- you gave us clarity on the dividend, and we know there's the $30 billion open authorization on the buyback. Again, just kind of fitting for the middle there, how do you balance just the magnitude of buyback you do from here versus the ongoing growth that we have in the balance sheet vis-\u00e0-vis what you just talked about as far as the limitations? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So I mean the answer to how we balance it is we talk about it a lot. We have a lot of smart people looking at it, trying to balance all the different constraints that we're managing. And I think Jen talked before, especially when it comes to the balance between our risk-based minimums and the SLR constraint, which, as you know, we can address with pref, so about kind of the mixture of prefs and common. So, we're looking at that. I think RRP is helping a little bit on the deposit growth side, which helps a little bit with the management of SLR. But, as I said previously, we're going to stay nimble there and use the tools at our disposal to try to strike the right balance between buybacks and pref issuance, recognizing that overissuing prefs potentially locks us into high cost prefs with low flexibility because of the five-year lockout. So, there's a lot of balancing there, and we're just staying nimble as information potentially trickles out on the evolution of the rules. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, just so then as far as how you guys will communicate, we'll just find out about the buyback on a quarterly basis as opposed to you giving a more broad outlook of your expectations around buybacks as it happened more in the past. Is that fair? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I think that's right, especially in the new environment that we're operating in from a buyback perspective, now that it's not sort of an approved plan through CCAR, but it\u2019s rather than just the overall $30 billion Board authorization. Given what I just talked about in terms of the need to stay nimble across multiple constraints, we wouldn't want to box ourselves in by speaking publicly ahead of time in terms of what we're going to do, so. And you know, obviously, our normal capital here. At the end of the day, we're always going to invest first and look at interesting acquisitions and pay a sustainable dividend. And at the end of that, we'll look at buybacks in the context of all the other factors. Jamie Dimon : Yes. We can probably give you a more definitive thing after they finish Basel III, which is now 10 years in the making and SLR and all the updates, and then you'll have more certainty about how this is going to operate going forward. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a follow-up on the card business. You had 7% quarter-over-quarter growth in balances, but I think your guidance was still a little cautious. Is that just being conservative, you're still not sure about the relationship between spend and balance growth, or how do we think about the good quarter and sort of that cautious outlook? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, I wouldn't use the word conservative. We've tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case numbers. So, we're going to be wrong, but hopefully, it will be wrong symmetrically. So, we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that don't have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them. So, the point that you highlight, the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in card loans and the relatively muted NII outlook is really just about pay rates. So, we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards really highly unusual as a result of some of the themes that we've called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet. So, as long as that's true, and we're seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances, that's going to be a little bit of an NII headwind until the consumer starts to re-lever, which we do think will happen. We just don't think it's likely to be a meaningful effect this year. Jim Mitchell : That's fair. And then, on the charge-offs, that's obviously been a big benefit. I think if we look at delinquencies, both early stage and later stage, they kept falling throughout the quarter. Is there anything unusual this quarter where we saw a pretty big drop? Should we expect further declines in NCOs as the year progresses, given delinquency trends? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, I think on charge-offs, I would just stick to the updated card guidance that we gave, which is lower, just saying there's going to be below 2.5. But again, it's the same themes, right? Like elevated cash buffers in consumers are resulting in exceptionally strong NCO performance and sort of upside surprises in terms of people paying. So, there's sort of two sides of the same coin right now, lower revolving balances, better NCOS. And then, as we continue returning to normal, presumably in 2022, we should see both of those come back slightly to historical trends. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey. Jeremy, welcome. My question, I want to follow-up, I think Glenn asked Jamie for the answer to this question. So I'm going to try again. Are these acquisitions that you've done, I count eight since December. And the question is, Jamie, what is the strategy? Is the strategy, I guess, in some cases, it's to disrupt to new markets as Jeremy said, maybe it's to avoid costs, maybe it's the scale across tens of millions of customers or, and this is the real question, are you looking to connect some of these acquisitions like Nutmeg with -- these Kraft Analytics, MaxX, [ph] C6 Bank, OpenInvest, 55ip. Is the goal to somehow 1 plus 1 plus 1 to equal more than 3 as you introduce these acquisitions, these companies, these people to each other to create kind of like a 21st century digital banking storefront, or is that too much of a reach? What's the grand plan here? Jamie Dimon : A little bit too much of a reach, but there's a very smart analyst who said it was a string of pearls, and I put in that category. On asset management Campbell [ph] is just managing lumber assets. Timber assets is going to be great things for asset management. 55ip has a tax-efficient management to it there. Obviously, Nutmeg, and what we're already doing in the UK will be linked together, offering consumers digital product, both in deposits, small business, eventually lending and investments, global investing, et cetera, makes sense. C6 is another one. Jeremy said it's a huge market. So, we're looking at anything which has adjacencies. It could be data, it could be management. A lot of these are going to fill in, and some are a little bit more discount for us. So, how we look at retail, digital overseas, we've got patience and time. And we're going to spend a lot of time to see if we can build something very different than we have in the United States. And so, it's a little bit of everything. The cxLoyalty, the travel company, again, if you look at that, we are already so large in the travel business. So, think of this as enhanced services and products and capabilities to work with our clients, travel packages, et cetera, which we already got to remember, the seventh largest travel company in the United States. And that doesn't include all the travel going across our credit card and debit card that's traveled, but we are in the travel -- effectively the travel agent. And so, it's a little bit of all that. I'm thrilled we're doing it. We're looking all the time. We're not going to end up with a lot of wasted assets. But some of these things may not work there, but that will be okay. Jeremy Barnum : Mike, the only thing I would add is there's a couple of themes that to me come through some of the things that we've done recently. One of them is ESG. You see that especially in the AWM deals. And the other is just improving the customer experience, whether it's through various fintech deals or cxLoyalty, customer experience is a key priority for us. And we want to have all the tools necessary to deliver that. Jamie Dimon : And equally important, we're putting a lot of money into building. And we have, like every quarter for the next two years, you're going to have new products and new services being rolled out across the Company. I think they're just exciting and very good, and more and more integrated, more and more simple to use, more and more customer friendly, et cetera. And so, -- but we're doing a little bit of all of that. And we want -- yes, go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Go ahead, Mike. Mike Mayo : And just my follow-up, as you talked about disrupting, I thought that was interesting, disrupting in the UK. But since you wrote your CEO letter, Jamie, I mean, it's only gotten more competitive from the fintech and big tech and big retail and everybody else. And that's a question that comes up probably to everyone on this call. Are you going to be disintermediated over the next five years, whether it's -- you know all the companies, but it just seems like they're ramping up that much more. You have an executive order from the White House, maybe you have to share data. What\u2019s your current mark-to-market of the threat from outside of banking to your business? Jamie Dimon : Yes. I don't see any different thing when I wrote the letter. I think we have huge competition in banking and shadow banking, fintech and big tech and Walmart. And obviously, there's always a changing landscape, but we also have a huge -- we've got brands and capability and products and services and market share and profitability. I think some of these competitors are going to do quite well. I think a lot of them will succeed over time. But that's called good old American capitalism. I'm quite comfortable we'll do fine. I do think there's going to be a lot of people still in the banking business. I'm talking over 5 or 10 or 15 years. I think one day on a call which when they took a shadow bank or banks who will shadow -- will be shadows themselves. Jeremy Barnum : We're working hard to make sure that we're offering services that are not disruptible because they're good. So if our clients are happy, and we're providing them a great experience, then there's nothing to disrupt. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just sticking with the digital strategy. We heard Jamie talk about multiple times around the lack of imagination that cost the banking industry in terms of either payments or buy now pay later, and you talked about your international expansion. But again, going back to Mike's point, as shareholders of banks in the U.S., should the expectation be that banks will be fast followers of what fintech comes up with and replicating that, given the risk of cannibalizing your own sort of revenue set, or do we expect or do you think we should expect more disruptive innovation coming from banks in the United States on consumer banking? Jamie Dimon : I think it's both. I mean, it's not an either/or question. And remember, a lot of these banks have done quite well, including Bank of America has done quite well in digital products and stuff like that. So, when I talk about lack of imagination, I mean, the whole Company. I mean, when you look at some of these things, it was -- we could have imagined more why they become a competitor down the road. So, some of these competitors are quite good. I call it Bobby and Eaton. [Ph] They start with one little thing. They have product. They have services. They have eyeballs. They had customers, and they find ways to monetize it. So, we've got to be a little more forward-looking in how they're looking at active guys and stuff like that. But in our case, there'll be a little bit of everything. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And I would just say the whole like cannibalization and fast following thing, I think we've moved a little bit beyond that. Like there will be times where we have the first idea and we're eager to lean in and innovate that way. There are times when someone else has the first idea, and we're eagerly copying it. But, the whole -- we don't want to do this thing that makes sense with the customer because we might be cannibalizing our own revenues, that's a recipe to become a shadow of your... Jamie Dimon : We have no fun cannibalizing revenue. Just keep that in mind. We will do the right thing when the time comes. And sometimes dayrate dollar short, but we'll do the right thing. And just if you look at the Company, I mean, if you look at -- we talked about SLR, I always get -- about CS and SLR, but look at the flows across this company. Look at the debit card, the credit card, the trading flows, the market share, the -- that's why I look at much more than what are the ups and downs to the earnings this quarter because of CECL. I don't think that means anything for the future of the company. I mean, our bankers, our traders, our credit card, our debit card, our merchant services, our auto business, our digital, it's doing pretty good. I read -- I look at these reports. My God, the company is doing quite fine. And yes, and we'd like to be a little critical of ourselves. I think when companies aren't, that's part of their failure. They should look at what they didn't do well and what other people have done well. And so, I'd be prepared. And we have a really fair assessment of the competition. It is very large and it's going to be very tough. It does not mean that JPMorgan will win, these eyes are open. Ebrahim Poonawala : And I agree and I think banks don't do talk enough about client acquisitions and market share. So, I agree with you there. Just as a follow-up, Jamie, very quickly. There's some questions around like peak inflation, peak growth. I know you guys are very bullish. Compare and contrast how the world looks to you today versus back in 2011 when we came out of the financial crisis and the risk of GDP growth disappointing over the next few years? Jamie Dimon : I think they're completely different fundamentally. Coming out of the '09 crisis, okay, the world was massive overleveraged. We had investment banks at 40 times leveraged, not JPMorgan. We did not need PARP and didn't need help. The Lehman, Baird, Goldman, Morgan, you had banks overseas, Dexia, the landed banks that I can't remember half of them, all went bankrupt. You had hedge funds deleveraging, a constant deleveraging, you had $0.5 trillion to $1 trillion in mortgage losses that were going to be recognized, actual losses spread around balance sheets and derivatives and stuff like that. So, the world is in a massive deleveraging mode. The consumers overleveraged, companies were overleveraged. The bridge book on Wall Street was $400 billion. Today, it's, I think, 60. If you look at today, today, everything we talk about loans being down is the consumer is -- the positive prime. The consumer, their house value is up, their stock rises up, their incomes are up, their savings are up, their confidence are up. The pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror. Hopefully, nothing gets worse with it. And they're ready to go. And you see it in home prices, you see it in auto purchases. You see it -- I mean, they'd be much higher but for supply constraints right now. And so -- and businesses equally are in good shape. They're not overleveraged today. They do have a lot of charts show that corporate debt is like higher than it was, so, is corporate cash. If you look at middle market losses, it's almost zero, almost zero and huge unutilized revolving stuff like that. So, the second the economy starts to grow, which -- and I mean, as you're going to see loans go up because inventory receivables and capital expenditures and stuff like that, so it is completely different. And you've got fiscal policy on autopilot. I mean, there's a lot that hasn't been spent yet. There's a lot more that's going to be passed. And if QE so far is a little bit of [indiscernible] $220 million [ph] a month. And I just think you're going to see -- hopefully, see a very strong economy. We don't know how long. Obviously, if you listened to what I just said, that is a inflationary effect on that. And we don't know in the future, I talk about Goldilocks. Goldilocks is -- and I'm hopeful, not predicting. Like Goldilocks is that inflation goes up, the 10-year bond goes up, the growth is still quite strong. You may have growth in the second half this year as stronger than it's ever been in the United States of America, okay? And Europe is probably six months behind America. And so, growth can go into next year, and the 10-year bond goes to 3% and a lot of growth, the short base grows. It won't make any difference. We always had strong growth in consumer there, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up. These are all good things. And so, obviously, if the inflation can be worse than people think, I think it will be a little bit worse with these kinds of things. I don't think it's all temporary, but that doesn't matter if we have very strong growth. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. There are always risks in any environment, but the risks in this one I think are quite different from the ones that we had coming out of the global financial crisis. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with just a follow-up question on card NII. Jeremy, you did strike an optimistic tone on the higher spend trends and the potential for future NII tailwind as payment rates start to normalize. And just looking at the card revenue rate, given there are another of inputs in that metric, I was hoping you could just help us isolate the potential NII benefit versus the current baseline from a normalization in payment rate. So, just the payment rate normalizing, what would be the incremental step-up in the quarterly NII run rate? Jeremy Barnum : Okay. So, there's a lot of pieces in that question. So first, let's talk about the revenue rate. So, a couple of things. So, in terms of the NII, we don't really see a meaningful uptick in card NII happening this year. Like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, but I think it's going to be pretty hard to see. So, I think you want to be thinking about that as a 2022 effect. I'm not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for 2022. And I will actually point out that we're in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers, and I'm happy to say actually the client acquisition in card is going great and we're seeing great uptake on the offers. But that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense. So, as I look out to next quarter, you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there. Steven Chubak : Okay. And for my follow-up, Jeremy, I just wanted to ask or at least hone in on one comment you made, where you said you could potentially still manage to a 12% capital target. I was just trying to better understand how much capital cushion you are looking to manage to under the SEB? And if the G-SIB surcharge is not recalibrated, where do you think you'll have to run on a steady-state basis just because it feels like waiting for to go, we haven't seen any changes on the recalibration front, specifically with the G-SIB surcharge. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Okay. So basically, that's a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where G-SIB doesn't get recalibrated. And a world where GSIB doesn't get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher, starting in 2023. We obviously disagree with that. We don't think it makes any sense at all, given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have. And as Jamie pointed out earlier, both we and the system are really flushed with capital, and the regulators have been pretty clear that there's enough capital in the system right now, and that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else. So, that's a big part of the reason why we've been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that. And I think we see some of our competitors making those points, too, as they start to creep up into higher buckets. And to be fair, the Fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that used to get fixed. It's just that they're kind of busy trying to get the Basel III end game put in place in the U.S. rules, which brings particular complexities in light of the Collins floor. Jamie Dimon : Can I just add to this? So, I've always remarked that the G-SIB calculation is one of the [indiscernible] I've ever seen in my whole life. And then we doubled it here. So, the European banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of -- they don't -- they can't have the regulators -- they can expand across Europe. But one of the advantages, they have pretty much half the G-SIB. But I still think that in the long run, that's right for America to be doubling what I could consider basing artificial number. So, let's just wait to see what all the new rules are, and then we'll answer that question. You don't have to sit there and guess what's going to happen. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And I think you see the important point is that in the near term, we're actually bound by leverage. So, that's what we're focused on right now. That's our biggest single thing that we'd like to see fixed because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really don't make sense and eventually result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy. Just to touch on your buffer point briefly, when all is said and done and the framework is fully settled, hopefully, we're back to being bound by risk-based constraints. We have a bit more experience with a couple of years of SCB and there's a little bit less rule uncertainty, it would be -- there's an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think it's important, and we've made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers. We've made this point in the context, for example, of the money market complex, too. We have all these kind of guidelines and the rules have them as buffers that you're supposedly free to use, but that's not the way everyone treats them. So, buffers become minimums, and that adds brittleness to the system that makes it more procyclical than anyone wants it to be. So, down the road when things are stable, the buffer discussion could become interesting. But right now, it's a somewhat simpler story, and that's really the SLR. Jamie Dimon : And remember, there's one buffer, you guys -- we don't really talk about, which is $40 billion of pretax earnings a year, okay? That's a huge buffer. It's huge. It allows you to change your forward-looking capital if you buy back stock and don't buy back stock. And so, we have a lot of levers. And whatever happens, we're going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I want to circle back on costs. Obviously, this year, some of it is driven by the stronger-than-expected fees. Some of it is the inflationary pressures you mentioned. Some is I think discretionary, as you pointed out in the past, accelerating some investment spend. But, the question is, as we exit this year, when we look back on costs from 2021 and say they're a little bloated because of all those factors, or is this going to be a good base year to grow off of going forward? Jeremy Barnum : Okay. So, there's a couple of points in there. There's -- the word -- let's talk about bloated. I mean, you've heard Jamie talk about cost before, right? So we go after everything all the time. We go after waste. We try very hard to never be loaded and to not waste. That is a constant discipline. It's hard work. We look for it everywhere. So I would like to say that bloated is not a word we would ever use to describe ourselves. And we spent a bunch of time in the valves of this organization. I really don't think that, that's true. And I don't think anything about what we're doing in terms of how money is being spent this year is wasteful. And in fact, as you know, the really big driver of the kind of impact on run rate spend is the investments that we're making, especially investments in technology and customer experience and then transforming the core efficiency of the company in terms of things like technology, modernization and data centers and so on. So, in terms of projecting forward into 2022, I don't want to get into giving 2022 expense guidance here. And I think that you really have to unpack that cost number between the parts of it that are volume and revenue-related and the kind of more run rate, structural and investment costs as we've talked about before. So, I think this year is -- it's a little bit tricky to unpack the components from their perspective to project them to... Jamie Dimon : If we can find more good money to spend, we're going to spend it. And I told you guys that there's good expense. When we have credit card spend, so much money in marketing, the returns are very good and they spend it. If we can open hire great bankers, something, we're going to spend it. If we can -- we spend $200 million in new data centers, which have a huge benefit for us down the road, we're going to spend it. We do not manage the Company so we can tell analysts what the expense number is going to be. That is just a bad way to run a company. And conversely, a lot of revenue stuff, too. Revenues aren't always good. And we all know how much risk we take in these businesses and stuff like that. So, we spend a lot of time in good revenue, bad revenue and good expense and debt expense. And that's what's going to drive the franchise in the next 5 or 10 years. Matt O\u2019Connor: Understood. And then separately, as we think about capital allocation kind of longer term, is there a thought to more meaningfully increase the dividend payout? I mean, as you saw at the beginning of the COVID crisis, buybacks were suspended, after stocks dropped sharply, banks couldn't repurchase until they roughly doubled. But dividends were maintained. And obviously, your pretax earnings power that you alluded to is very strong. It seems like that soft 30% cap has gone, obviously. So, just thoughts, it's not going to happen all in maybe one CCAR cycle, but if we do get a multiyear economic recovery, is your thoughts of pushing the dividend higher maybe closer to like a 50% payout? Jamie Dimon : Probably not. I mean, I think firstly, we wanted the dividend which is sustainable through a bad downturn, and so we really want to do that. And I think this time kind of proves that. It was a very minor thing relative to capital retention. But we want to invest in our future and invest in growing and stuff like that. And if we can't -- and we don't want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples your ability to do other things. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And the way that flows into just capital buffer sort of makes that point clear, right? So every -- part of the reason that we're at 3.2 instead of 3.1 is the $0.10 increase that the Board announced its intention to do. Jamie Dimon : And if I owned 100% of the Company, there would be no dividend. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- if you take a look at your net interest margin in the quarter, obviously, it came under pressure. And if we assume -- and I know this is a big assumption, but if we assume that rates don't really change from here over the next 6 to 12 months, the long end stays anchored where it is, at what point does the average yield in your average interest-earning assets start to stabilize or maybe go up because the new business that you're putting on equals or exceeds what's running off in terms of interest rates on the products that are coming off the balance sheet? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Good question, Gerard. So, I mean, I guess one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that NIM has hit the bottom in this quarter. And I think we've all learned the lesson that calling the bottom is a very dangerous thing. And I would also point out, and I would direct you to like the last page of our supplement, I'm not going to give you a big speech on markets NII, which is my favorite topic and why that is really a sort of a distraction that we shouldn't look at, maybe a little bit about next quarter. But we do have that disclosure where we split out total NII and markets NII as well as NIM excluding markets. And the reason I raised that is that, yes, your overall mental model is not wrong. It's reasonable to think that NIM might stabilize around these levels. But it's noisy, and the markets numbers in there, and that's going to add noise. And also, I would say right now, there's an unusual amount of numerator, denominator type effects. So whatever winds up being true about the numerator, you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there, which is one of the reasons that we obviously don't manage to that number as you've heard us say before. But your overall frame, it sounds reasonable to me. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up, and I may have misheard you, so correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you said that the higher level of noninterest expense, the outlook that is, was really driven by the improved outlook for noninterest income. Can you give us any color on that part of it, the outlook for noninterest income improvement? Jeremy Barnum : Well, it's -- I mean, some of it's in actuals, and some of it's in the outlook. But at a high level, the point is simply that if you look at the mix of revenue across this company, we have some offsetting dynamics right now. We've got NII headwinds from the consumer delevering, as we've discussed. But, as you saw in this quarter's CIB and AWM results, we had exceptional performance in banking even though -- and in wealth management. And even though markets is down year-on-year, it's actually up significantly from what we expect [Technical Difficulty] higher expense guidance. So, that's kind of how it all comes together. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate it. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : You want some of these expenses to go up because that means that good revenues are going up. Jamie Dimon : Indeed. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a couple of questions. One was just on thinking through the outlook for NII, like you indicated, $52.5 billion, subject to market conditions. Can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about market conditions? What's the trigger point for being maybe better than expected versus coming down? And I ask in context of -- I noticed your securities book, you shifted a bunch from AFS to HTM. So, it feels like from that, you're waiting more for rates to move up materially before you would lean into that yield curve trade. Maybe you can give us a sense as to what that market conditions comment was referring to and how you're thinking about that? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. So, let's go through that for a second. So, I said I wasn't going to give my big markets NII speech until next quarter, but I can't resist. So, you talk about market conditions, the markets NII component of that NII outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus TBA, is the extent to which we have futures versus cash and high rate countries like Brazil, the growth in prime brokerage balances. The common theme across all of these is there are situations where you're deploying balance sheet in the markets business to serve clients. And that's profitable deployment on a spread basis, but there's quite a bit of gross up between the kind of non-derivative piece of it and a derivative or derivative-like piece of it, where the derivative piece of it doesn't have any NII, and the non-derivative piece of it does. So, every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the NII number, either up or down, with very little impact to the bottom line. Now that's not the entirety of the market story. There are parts of the markets business where we're actually doing more... Jamie Dimon : The market, not the market... Jeremy Barnum : No, I know. But a part of the market dependent comment is the market dependent -- I don't have markets. I'll go to the other point in a second, and I'm almost done with the speech. Anyway, you get the point. So, that's one point of fluctuation. But going to your other piece, so the AFS, HTM, and I think your implied question, which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment. So, I will say that the AFS, HTM changes that you've seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment. But given the level of cash balances right now, the AFS, HTM, there really remain constrained in terms of duration buys. And I think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of short-end cash deployment tactically as we always do. So, to get to the punchline, it's kind of what we said before, which is, we're bullish on the economy. We believe that that comes with higher inflation and therefore, higher rates. And in light of that, we're happy to be patient right now. When that actually changes and we decide to deploy more, you'll see it in the future. Jamie Dimon : And just a simple way to think about it, the 52.5 other than the markets business, which goes up or down, if rates go up, you do see our earnings at risk disclosure, we will earn more NII, all things being equal, which of course they never are, but all the deal. And in addition to that, we can make decisions to deploy more money for more NII. Betsy Graseck : It's interesting versus when you were at our conference, Jamie, but it seems like the 52.5 is more a function of the curve, given the fact that card did, it looks like better than you had thought at that time in the middle of June, based on your comments about spend being up so much. But, the... Jamie Dimon : Betsy, let me just -- sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second because I think someone else has a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see that very healthy sequential growth in card loans on the back of spending. But, the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so, our view on that really hasn't changed, and we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook this year. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No, I totally get that. Jamie Dimon : I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year, okay? I think, we'll be a little conservative on that because of all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I look at much more is how many cards you have? How much spend do you have? How many happy customers do you have? NII will take care of itself. Betsy Graseck : And on that front, your card fees were quite good, right? You mentioned that in your press release. Maybe you can give us a sense as to the drivers? Is that new openings? Is that basically what it is? How sustainable is that? Because that was a bit of an upside surprise in this result, the card fees? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think it's just spend, right, Betsy? I mean we can get you a bit more color than that. Reggie can follow-up if you want. But at a high level, I think the card spend number is really all about -- I mean, sorry, the card fee number is really all about spend terms. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just one last if I can squeeze it in. Your VAR came down significantly. Can you give us a sense as to what's going on there? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, that's just the volatility of last year's prior quarter coming out of the time series, right, if you think about it. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Charles Peabody : Yes. I want to ask that NII question a little bit differently. In reiterating your $52.5 billion guidance, you said there was potential for some variation or variability around that number. And I'm trying to understand where the greatest variation could come from. Is it in your loan growth expectations? Because I'm hearing that you really are not expecting much in the way of loan growth, or is it in the shape of the yield curve because of the Fed's QE actions or words around taper? And talking about the yield curve, could you also talk a little bit about what's more important, the short end of the yield curve between Fed funds in the two-year or the long end? And in that conversation, also talk about the significant amount of liquidity that's about to hit the short end. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : There is a disclosure in the March 31st 10-Q, it shows earning risk if rates go up 100 basis points, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar of $7 billion, if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points. So, the $7 billion, some number like 4.5 or 5 is short rates versus long rates. The long rate number is cumulative. I would add every year until you roll over these things at slightly higher rates. That is the number, okay? They are -- obviously, loan growth is loan growth, that's in the plus or minus, but the biggest thing is interest rates. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Jeremy Barnum : Because of variables. Well, let me give you the variables, Charles, because it's kind of a reasonable question. So I'll spare any more markets NII speech. You heard it already, but that's obviously a big factor. Within card, we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth, but just remember that that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive NII. And so, if pay rates remain -- as I said earlier, it's the central case forecast that reflects the recent experience. So, we are forecasting elevated pay rates. But of course, we could be wrong, they could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting. So, that would be downside. And the opposite of that if we see the consumer relevering, starting a little bit sooner, would create upside there. And then, there's the impact of deployment. So we're staying patient right now. That means that we're not earning the steepness of the yield curve. And if that changes, that could create a little bit of upside. And then, there's always the tactical action that we can in the front end of the curve. Right now, those aren't very interesting because IOER is above money market rates, which is a big part of the reason that you see RRP having so much uptake. But if that were to change and there were opportunities in repo and so on, then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there. But that's not again our simple case. Charles Peabody : Just to follow-up on that. I mean, the liquidity that's going to hit in July and August is substantial. And that's going to have some impact on the shape of the yield curve at the short end. We saw a rise in the overnight repo rate, reverse repo rate in June. Is it possible that we have to have another one to keep rates from falling too far? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think that's a question for kind of short-term fixed income market strategists and my old research team. But right now, it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to making sure that repo rates don't trade negative. That's part of the reason they made the technical correction. That's part of the reason RRP is paying what it pays. So, we'll see what happens there. But to me, the front end of the yield curve from a deployment perspective looks not very interesting right now, and that is kind of our central case for the rest of this year. Charles Peabody : And did the rise in the RRP rate have any -- your comments about market-driven NII, did it have any impact on market-driven NII? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. That's not really the way that works\u2026 Jamie Dimon : About 5 basis points. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean I think you may be -- I mean, I don't know if it's part of your question or not, but there's, of course, the increase in IOER, and there's some pretty simple math you can do there about 5 basis points on -- or 10 basis points on $0.5 trillion for half a year. But those are pretty small numbers in the scheme of all the precision we're dealing with here. Operator : A follow-up question is coming from the line from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, I just wanted to follow-up. Can you give us some color about the residential mortgage lending business? How was the gain on sale margins this quarter? Any outlook on margins or any outlook on volumes, I should say? But also, did you say also that you guys sustained a small loss or a loss in the servicing area? If so, what drove that? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So let's talk a little bit about mortgage, which is a business I'm still learning. But, we've had very robust originations, $40 billion this quarter. I think the most significant -- one of the significant things that's going on is we've really finished unwinding all of our credit pullbacks from the crisis. So, we're fully back in the corresponding channel, which is obviously helping the volumes. There's obviously been a huge refi boom over the last year with lower rates. That's starting to slow down a little bit. The purchase market has been quite robust, although now we've seen so much home price appreciation that maybe affordability starts to be a little bit of a headwind. So, as we sit here today from a margin perspective, you have your kind of typical dynamics. As rates go up a little bit, refi slows down a little bit that the industry has built capacity. You have probably a little bit of a margin headwind looking forward. And obviously, there's a mix effect. So, as corresponding becomes a much bigger part of the originations, you have mix-based margin compression, so. And obviously... Jamie Dimon : \u2026 was at all-time highs. And now, it's not even normal. It's just getting -- all-time highs. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, exactly. So it's a headwind relative to a super elevated prior year quarter, but it's still perfectly healthy. In terms of the servicing business, I think really, as you all understand, in the current environment, the prepayment rates, prepayment speeds have been running significantly above our model forecast. And so, as we continue to really update those as part of our risk management, that can -- small risk management losses. But in general, the risk management of the parts of the MSR that can be managed has actually been very good and very stable. So, I think that's everything you had, Gerard, right? Gerard Cassidy : Yes. Thank you very much. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Operator : No incoming questions. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : At the end, I just wanted to thank Jen Piepszak for a great job as CFO. You'll also know she's happy Wisconsin in a new job. And Jeremy, I know a lot of you know Jeremy, but he's been the CFO of the IB for seven or eight -- eight years or so, so a complete professional. And so, Jeremy, welcome to your first call, and congratulations. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, Jamie. Jamie Dimon : Also talk to you all soon. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Well, I survived it. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That marks the end of your call. Thank you for joining, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby, we're about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11.7 billion, EPS of $3.74 on revenue of 30.4 billion, and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 22%.  These results include a $2.1 billion net credit reserve release, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as an income tax benefit of 566 million. Adjusting for these items, we delivered an 18% or OTC this quarter, touching on a few highlights. It was another strong quarter for investment banking, including an all-time record for M&A.  And while loan growth remains muted, we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the Company and particularly in card. And consistent with last quarter, credit continues to be quite healthy. In fact, net charge-offs are the lowest we've experienced in recent history. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $30.4 billion was up $500 million or 2% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 1% with Balance Sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower CIB Markets NII. And NIR was up 3% driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and AWM largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending.  Expenses of 17.1 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses, predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year. and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.5 billion driven by the reserve release. But it's also worth noting that net charge-offs of just over $500 million were approximately half of last year's third-quarter number.  Let's cover reserves on the next page. We released $2.1 billion this quarter driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize. Reserves stand at 20.5 billion, which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding COVID, and the current labor market dynamics, including the exploration of expanded unemployment benefits. Now moving to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CG1 ratio of 12.9% down modestly primarily on higher RWA. The firm distributed $8 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including 5 billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to $1 per share. With that, let's move on to our businesses starting with Consumer and Community Banking on page 5.  CCB reported net income of 4.3 billion, including reserve releases of 950 million on revenue of $12.5 billion down 3% year-on-year. Deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing. Notably contributing to this growth, we ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on the FDIC data, and we're the only large bank to show meaningful share growth up 70 basis points year-on-year. Similarly, client investment assets were up 29% year-on-year. And while market performance was a driver, retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong. Touching on spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 24% versus the third quarter of '19 and in line with last quarter, within that data, travel, and entertainment spend was up 8% versus 3Q '19, and very closely track the patterns of the Delta variant within the quarter, softening in August and early September, and reaccelerating in recent weeks.  Card outstanding\u2019s were up 1% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from higher new account originations. And while the payment rate is still very elevated, it's come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized. And when we look inside our data, we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize in segments of the population that traditionally revolve. So as a result, we're optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances. Moving to home lending. Average loans or down 6% year-on-year, but up 2% quarter-on-quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly 42 billion, up 43% year-on-year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market. And in Auto, we had 11.5 billion of originations, second only to last quarter's record.  So overall, loans PPP, were up 3% quarter-on-quarter on the growth in card and home lending I just mentioned Expenses 7.2 billion, were up 5% year-on-year, driven by investments in the business, including marketing. And more generally, we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up 10% year-on-year to almost 45 million.  So with that, looking forward, we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends. However, we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to pre-pandemic levels, given the amount of liquidity in the system. In the meantime, credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinary low. In card on a year-to-date basis versus 2019, low charge-offs more than offset lower NII.  Next, the corporate and investment bank on Page 6, CIB reported net income of $5.6 billion on revenue of 12.4 billion. Investment banking revenue of $3 billion was up 45% versus the prior year, and down 12%, sequentially. IB fees were up 52% year-on-year, driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our number 1 rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 9.4%. An advisory was an all-time record quarter benefiting from the surge in M&A activity, and we almost tripled fees year on year in a market that doubled. Debt underwriting fees were up 3% driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing.  And in equity underwriting, fees were up 41% primarily driven by our strong performance and IPOs. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the overall pipeline is healthy and the M&A market is expected to remain active. And if so, IBTs should be up year-on-year, but down sequentially. Moving to Markets, total revenue was 6.3 billion, down 5% compared to a record third quarter last year.  Notably, we were up 24% from 2019, driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products. Fixed income was down 20% year-on-year due to ongoing normalization across products, particularly in commodities, as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio.  Equities was up 30%, a record third quarter, with strength across regions and, and reflecting higher balances in prime, strong client activity in cash, as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives. In terms of outlook, keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against the record fourth quarter last year.  But the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues. Wholesale payments revenue of $1.6 billion was up 22% or up 10% excluding gains on strategic equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was driven by higher deposits and fees, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Security Services revenue of 1.1 billion was up 9%, primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels. Expenses of 5.9 billion or flat year-on-year as higher structural and volume and revenue-related expense, as well as investments, were offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of 638 million, driven by the reserve release I mentioned upfront. Moving to commercial banking on Page 7, commercial banking reported net income of $1.4 billion, revenue of 2.5 billion was up 10% year-on-year on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue.  Record gross investment banking revenue of $1.3 billion was up 60% primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in MNA and acquisition-related financing across both corporate client and middle-market banking. Expenses of $1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were up 4% sequentially, mainly driven by higher operating balances, and loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C & I loans were down 3%, but up 1%, excluding PPP, driven by higher originations. And it's also worth noting that consistent with last quarter, we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market.  And those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels. CRE loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of 363 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 6 basis points.  And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion with pretax margin of 37%, record revenue of 4.3 billion was up 21% year-on-year as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 2.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation, as well as distribution fees.  For the quarter net long-term inflows of 33 billion, continue to be positive across all channels, asset classes, and regions, with notable strength in equities and fixed income. AUM of $3 trillion and overall assets of $4.1 trillion, up 17% and 22% year-on-year respectively, were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows.  And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, with continued strength in custom lending, securities-based lending, and mortgages. While deposits were up 5% sequentially. Turning to corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $817 million, including 383 million of the 566 million tax benefit, that I mentioned upfront. Revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion down 957 million year-on-year.  N II was a loss of 1.1 billion down 372 million, primarily unlimited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued. And we realized 256 million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to 466 million of net gains last year. Expenses of a 160 million were down 559 million year-on-year, primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year. On the next page, let's discuss the outlook. Our full-year outlook for 2021 remains largely in line with our previous guidance.  We still expect NII to be approximately $52.5 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $71 billion. But as you'll see on the page, we've lowered our outlook for the card net charge-off rate to around 2% as delinquencies remain very low. So to wrap up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic.  The strengths of the Company, both in terms of our diversified business model, as well as our fortress Balance Sheet, talent and culture, have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients, customers, and communities. As we look ahead and the environment normalizes, new challenges will undoubtedly arise, but we feel confident with the position of the Company and the strategy going forward. With that, Operator, please open the line to Q&A. Operator : And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John, please proceed. John McDonald : Good morning, Jeremy. Wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year. It seems to imply a nice step-up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly 13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step-up and would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think about our 2022 NII forecasts? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, John. Good question and good catch there. It's true, that is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the math, it suggests about 350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolving and deployment and so on, The increase is non-intuitively high.  And so just to explain within that, there are a couple of factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets and our growth between the third and the fourth quarter, which in general we would sort of encouraging you to ignore. And there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number. If you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth, which is a little bit more consistent, I think with the overall story that we've been tying, which is that the real acceleration in NII, especially from higher card revolve, is a 2022 item.  In that context, then if you take that sort of lower number and thinking about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that that would be a lower-end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of -- especially card revolve. But obviously, we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022, next quarter. John McDonald : Okay. And as a follow-up, your cash balances continue to grow and you have been conservative on liquidity appointments, could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment, pacing that, and what factors you're balancing? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, totally. At the highest level, I would say that nothing's really changed, meaning we're still all else equal, happy to be patient. We still believe in a robust global recovery. We still are a little bit concerned about inflation, I think relative to the consensus. And all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment. But it's also fair to say, that relative to last quarter, rates are obviously higher. We start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit, so the market-implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view and given that, it wouldn't be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front-end deployment, cash, and cash-like activity, as well as possibly some duration management. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please, proceed. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Just first on loan growth. As you noted, the auto has been a strong card starting to show signs of life, but it looks like outside of acquisition, finance, C &I still seems a little weak and we've got ongoing supply chain issues. I don't know, as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess loan demand trends playing out, and what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously, that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in. And so if we start with a card, which is obviously the one that's going to amount of the most in terms of NII impact, as you said, we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway and it seems hopeful like Delta is really fading so that's going to help.  If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality, normal growth there. And the question really for Card as we've talked about a lot is whether that growth in spend and in Card outstanding translates into Revolve.  But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers, and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to Revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there. So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstanding to grow with the higher spending, but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year. It's going to take time obviously, but that is the core view. In-home lending, broadly, we expected this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue.  And then in C&I, which you mentioned, just a reminder, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers were eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise. But from a financial performance perspective, that's more of an outcome rather than a goal. But we do, as I noted up front, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates. So that's consistent with a theme that we've been seeing, which is that the smaller you are, the less likely you are to have benefited from the wide-open Capital Markets, the more likely you are to be borrowing.  We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline, as we've fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward. And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets actually, and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets, but it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of, in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's all very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. You and your peers have all seen higher expenses this year, higher capital markets, and incentive expenses, and increased investment spend. But as we think about going into next year, our capital markets activity normalizes as many expect. Can we start to see expense growth slow or are there other considerations to think about whether it's investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So it's a little bit of an all-of-the-above story I would say. So first of all, we're still in the middle of budgeting and it's sort of a little early to be giving you 2022 expense guidance. We'll do more of that next quarter, but realistically, expenses are going to be up next year. Now, to your point about capital markets-related expenses, it's obviously true that we pay for performance and in light of the very strong performance over the last couple of years in both Banking and Markets, we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up.  And therefore, as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in 2022, you're going to see that come down in line all else equal. Obviously, I would point out, that I think that the amount of growth in that number that we've seen through the pandemic, is less than a lot of people would have expected, actually.  And therefore, on the way back down, you would also potentially expect less participation, not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stock-based compensation investing. So all of that aside, at the same time, we are still investing. We still see significant opportunities.  We still see marketing opportunities in the card, and yeah, labor inflation is a question. You saw us raise wages in parts of the U.S. at the entry level. That just came into effect this September. And as we look out, we see a lot of churns. And as Jamie was saying, it's good stuff, it's normal, it's understandable in this environment, but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us. So when you put all that stuff together, as I said, we'll update you more next quarter, but that's how we see the expense outlook for next year. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi, there are a couple of events during the quarter that I wanted to ask about, and specifically, how has the tech strategy evolved? One, you made the announcement that you're changing the retail bank core system entirely to the public cloud. and that's a big change.  And Jamie, I would love to hear your comments on that. And then second, your expansion in the UK with digital banking, what metrics are you shooting for? And third, your recent Fintech acquisitions to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in addition to JPMorgan? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Okay, Mike. Hang on. I'm writing doing your questions because I don't want to lose track. Let's start with the Cloud first. Yeah, you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with Thought Machine. At a high level, there's actually nothing new here. We've actually been committed to the Cloud for a long time.  And by the way, when I say Cloud, I think we're talking about both private and public Cloud. Our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both. And I think that's very important for us as a regulated institution from our resiliency perspective. But the reasons, for do -- and that's all part of our overall tech monetization road map. And a lot of the investments that we're doing that you've heard all the leadership of the Company talk about. When it comes to Thought Machine in the consumer space, There are five main reasons why we did that and it's all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech monetization.  We want to be able to innovate quickly and bring custom products to consumers faster. We want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform. As I mentioned, resiliency is critical. Increasingly, we want to be able to run the bank much more in real-time rather than based on batch processes.  And obviously, APIs are central to the entire strategy in this environment. So that's what I would say about that. Now -- yes, Jamie. Jamie Dimon : Thought Machine is, basically, the core general ledger. It's not all the other stuff around the consumer. And when you do these conversions different than conversions in the past, you can do them -- you could schedule pieces, do part at a time, not all at once, like a big bang, which we used to have to do when we did big merge and stuff like that. So it's -- put it at a lower risk for the Company. But the core strategy hasn't changed at all. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. Okay. And then Mike, international consumer and acquisitions, I think you asked about. So in terms of international consumers, you will have seen that we launched -- it's obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that, but you will have noted actually that we've just rebranded NutMeg as a JPMorgan Company just a couple of days ago.  So all that's proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received. I think the offering has seen us differentiated and innovative, so we'll have more to say about that over time. Generally -- Jamie Dimon : I just again, this is -- this is a 10-year game plan. This is not, they're going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two. And with this the long-term work to try to get this thing right because if we're ever going to be retail overseas, it's going to be digital. And so we're going to be very patient. and at one point Mike, we will report some metrics so you can see them, but they're not going to be material to the firm's numbers for years. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. That's going to take time for sure. So -- but just more generally, in terms of the acquisition strategy, we've talked about this a little bit before. We're not claiming that we have some overarching top-down acquisition strategy.  I think broadly we are just doing things that make sense. But there are some themes that you can detect around bolt-on and adding capabilities. If -- just for the sake of argument, if you start with AWM, you'll see a pretty consistent theme in there of ESG related capability additions.  You've mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth, and it will be a long game, as Jamie says. And then, yeah, there's definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that we've done in the CIB.  And then within the consumer, most recently, the collection of things that we've done I think is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers. We've always been very proud of the value proposition that we offer, especially in the Card product. But we think we can take it up another notch with some of the stuff that we're doing around lounges and CX loyalty and stuff like that. I think I touched on everything there, Mike. Mike Mayo : That you certainly did. And just as a follow-up, we see the results, the marginal efficiency in the businesses where you're growing has improved. And we just don't have the why. So how much of that is tech-driven versus other reasons that I guess you have metrics internally that we just don't have. But your, your marginal efficiency is what or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to why the marginal efficiency is improving? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. I mean, I think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff, especially in terms of what parts of the expensive space to see us a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating.  I would've said that in reality, marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think. So the operating leverage that you see, especially in the type of environment that we've had with really big increases in revenue on the capital markets areas and on the NRR site is actually relatively consistent with what I would've expected, but a little bit to your point, Mike, what's also true is that we're a big organization.  There's a scale play here. We have a big fixed cost base and a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesn't creep and that it's as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible. And that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible. But that's a long play there. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Jamie Dimon : And Mike, one of the things you think about, one is you people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that. We're playing the game for ten years here. So we're going to -- and we're not going to disclose certain things, like, margin byproduct or something like that because it's competitive information. But in the long game, we're competing with some very large, talented, global players, who are not even in banking today. And we are going to compete in that. So even some of these acquisitions are more around that, than around what I consider traditional banking.  And so -- in my whole life, just so you know, we've been modernizing technology, Every year of every month of every quarter, that's like a permanent state of affairs. Obviously, now it's to the Cloud and stuff like that. Those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward. That was true, by the way, 20 years ago. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Next up, we have a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please, proceed. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon card fees and card revenue rate. We all certainly expected the marketing expenses to go up inside that line. And just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter and just what your general outlook is for the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Ken. You're right. Part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend, which you would have expected. As a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth and spending as we emerge from the pandemic and the fact that we're out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and we're seeing nice growth there.  So that's expected. And I think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated. And if anything ticks up a little bit sequentially, just based on how the amortization there works. So you should expect to see that continue.  But in addition, this quarter we have an adjustment to the rewards liability, which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well. So that is not something that we see continuing. So that should come out of the run rate as we look forward. Ken Usdin : Can you help us understand what the magnitude of that is and what you think about the overall Card revenue rate going forward? Jeremy Barnum : I mean, we don't really manage the Card revenue rate, so it's not a number that I'm eager to guide to. But I think the -- if I remember correctly, I think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like 180 million, so we'll confirm that, but I think that's right. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks. If I might just ask Jamie, you made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing by next year around this time. What are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the logjams and the potential for that to open up from here? Jamie Dimon : I'm not hearing much different than you're hearing. I'm just -- I know that the over-focus over time is so extraordinary sometimes in the press, that people forget the big picture. The economy's going 4 or 5%. What people are buying is changed, which has also hurt supply chains a little bit.  There's not one Company I know who's not working aggressively to fix the supply chain issues. Sales are still up, credit card debit card spends still up because it was in great shape. And capitalism works. I doubt we'll be talking about supply chain stuff in a year. I just think that [Indiscernible] we're focusing on too much is simply dampening a fairly good economy. It's not reversing a fairly good economy. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next up, we have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I have 2 questions : one, just following up on the Card discussion that we just have regarding the fees and the 180 million on the -- roughly 180 million on the rewards adjustment. I mean, it still leaves us with a pretty big decline in Q-on-Q. And I'm just trying to think through that a little bit because I know marketing rewards, etc, is up.  But was there anything, in particular, that would have driven a one-timer that is unlikely to persist or not? I realize that cashback is a little more expensive, so maybe that's a piece of it and it's a one-time move or is it more a function of, hey, we're going to be ramping our offerings here. And so you should expect that the forward-look is a step-down from what you had been seeing in 2Q? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So Betsy, in short, it's really the latter. So the only thing that is one-time - ish in nature, for lack of a better term, is the rewards liability adjustment. And the rest of it really is marketing spend.  And we see that as a critical investment at this moment to moment of high engagement with the product, and we're very committed to making those investments. And so that is going to remain elevated. And if anything, tick off a little bit as we look forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then separately, I think today is the last day of the Vice-Chair of Supervision, Randy Quarles as Vice-Chair of [Indiscernible] and so the question is, how should we be thinking about how you are positioning for an environment where maybe these rules don't change, right?  Like the LCR, the SLR, other things that we had been hoping might have some changes in them. Should we be anticipating that in order to help deliver the growth that you're looking for, that we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So I think, obviously, we're a little disappointed that we haven't seen some of the changes on the non-risk sensitive size-based constraints that we'd expected, but we're still hopeful that that will come soon.  We know the staff is hard at work on the [Indiscernible] endgame, and that's complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of those things are connected.  And our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the SLR constrain, without over issuing and therefore being stuck with a high-cost product that isn't callable for 5 years.  So that's part of the reason why we're operating a little bit above our CET1 target right now, and we're just going to continue to be nimble in that respect. Operator : Thanks. Next up, a question from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line proceeds. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near-term. Did I hear your comments on payment rates and cards for [Indiscernible] seasonality, optimism about revolving card balances.  So is there an implicit comment within there about buying now, pay later, and the impact it may or may not have? I'd love to get your perspective on hand this old, but I guess a new payment option might have on the cards industry overall. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So BNPL, everyone's talking about it. It is funny how layaway is back in the e-commerce checkout land. But -- and obviously, we're looking at it. Everyone is talking about it and it's a moment for us as a Company where even though for any given thing that's emerging, you can easily convince yourself that it's kind of not a threat.  We're in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions, especially [Indiscernible] type disruptions quite seriously. And in the case of BNPL, it's obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that we've seen, although it's a relatively small portion of the overall market.  I will remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of My Chase Loan and My Chase Plan, which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of the post-purchase experience. You can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to an installment plan if you want. But yeah, we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point-of-sale, which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there.  But even more generally when you take a step back, what we're really trying to do in the consumer business here, is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth and BNPL and how can we respond to it in a strategic holistic way across all of our customers, and not too narrowly and too reactively, just respond to BNPL, but it's, obviously, a thing that we're looking at it and it's quite interesting. Jamie Dimon : I think it's another example of growth in the Company. You saw a firm come out and it's no longer just about BNPL. They're going to have a debit card and attached banking accounts. So these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to. And so that's why when we talked about, like, expenses, we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Maybe one mother comment or get your thought on the right perspective to think about China and Evergrande and what people care about most is, is there an expansion across the border, meaning, is this a contained within their market? Are the funders, that will have some marks within their market, or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So look, obviously, everyone is looking at Evergrande. Let me start by just saying that, for us, in terms of direct Evergrande exposure is absolute de minimis. So that's one piece. As you would expect, we've also looked at more indirect exposures in terms of the broad China property sector, as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with, to the China property sector, and in general, those exposures are all very modest.  So we're, obviously, watching it closely and continuing to look for reading across and do what you would expect us to do, but we're not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us.  I think, in terms of cross-border contagion, I don't hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard, but it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the Chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines. So it's a process that's being managed. And I would say the better view right now is that it will be contained. But of course, it's the market, so we'll see what happens. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for all that, Jeremy. Thanks. Operator : Next up, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on two things that were discussed; one around FinTechs and the regulatory changes, a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies.  Jamie, you've talked about in the past in terms of regulatory arbitrage, when you look at big tech non-bank players, I think BNPL is a good example of that. Do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies, they're alert to this arbitrage, and do you think we see a clampdown, or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would level the playing field? Jamie Dimon : I don't expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks. And, I think, that we just have to compete with what we're -- the hand we're dealt, and not expect anything like that. And I think that you're going to have some people clamp down more in banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or service, something like that. But I'm not expecting any relief. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good. Yeah. and I was just wondering if there would be increased scrutiny of the non-bank players then it's good to banks, but point noted. And I guess, just on a separate question, Jeremy, we didn't see any building the CET1 when I look at the numerator, anything going on there this quarter that impacted it? And with the stock rate is at 2.4 times tangible, just remind us of how important are buybacks here, and opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, the answer to how important buybacks are that they're at the end of our capital hierarchy we often say, right. So organic growth, including acquisitions, sustainable dividends, and only then do we look at buybacks. And in light of the SCB environment that we're in, where we don't have a Fed-approved buyback plan anymore and we just simply have to comply with the minimums and BAU, that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness, which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world Jeremy Barnum : where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon. So nothing really going on in this quarter other than a little bit of RWA growth in the denominator and we're just really going to stay nimble there. Ebrahim Poonawala : But is there a case to be made, Jamie, in terms of just holding some dry-powder in excess capital given your macro outlook, as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations? Jamie Dimon : Yeah, I [Indiscernible] evaluations -- as the stock goes up, you're going to -- you should expect to one day buy less. And we don't need dry powder, we have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity. I mean extraordinary, and we earned 40 billion pre-tax a year. I mean, how much dry powder do you need? We have $1.6 trillion of cash and marketable securities. We have 200 -- well over 200 billion of equity. We can issue prefers, we can issue debt, we can issue stock if we had to do something. So I don't think we need dry powder. I think our capital cup runneth over where it is. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. Thank you. Operator : Next one is from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Steven Chubak : Good morning. So, Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth? Or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration lending activity, whether it's just greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the card payment rates, or something else? Jeremy Barnum : Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I -- I'm not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I mean, we've talked a lot about Spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher, so that's one piece.  And the Revolve story within that as a function of the spend down and cash buffers, especially in our revolver -- the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well if you think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings in the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives things.  In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system. In a world where, even if tapering sorts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly 8 months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE.  So we're dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum. But. frankly, that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps, Jeremy Barnum : but it's a good question. Steven Chubak : Thanks, Jeremy. It absolutely helps. And just one clarifying question on the [Indiscernible] commentary. You noted this quarter's result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio. So maybe you can help unpack what that adjustment actually entails, what prompted it, and could you help size the impact in the quarter? Jeremy Barnum : I could help unpack it, but it would take another 20 minutes which we don't really have. It's just bog-standard liquidity evaluation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction costs would be associated with transferring certain types of positions. It's normal course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger. I think fixed income was down 20% and I think without that it would have been down 15%. So if that helps. Steven Chubak : Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Next question is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Hey guys. I was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And, I guess, it's to lead it a little bit. If we look at the growth in deposits, and I know some of them are considered non-core, but take out the loan growth and the growth in the securities book since COVID. It's not about an extra 500 billion of deposits. And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities? And understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up. So that'll go to some. But is there a way to a size that 500 billion capacity in terms of buying securities? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is at any given moment. Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also we will always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII.  And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see the value. And that if anything is probably the biggest single factor right now. As I talked about earlier, Jeremy Barnum : it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective. And that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. but when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in and the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed, and there's just not a lot of value there. So we always try to be long-term economically motivated there, considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that. Matthew O\u2019Connor: I mean, I just did on a near-term basis, but I think a lot of investors are sitting here saying if the 10-year or really any part of that curve hits that magic point for you, what is this at capacity? So for example, if the 10-year gets to say 3%, and your confidence is not going to go to 5, do you have 100 billion at capacity, is it 300 billion? Just any way to frame it longer-term appreciating that it's not what you're looking to do at this moment at these levels. Jeremy Barnum : No, I get the question. Jamie Dimon : We could easily do 200 billion. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. I mean, I get the question. I get why you want to know, I guess, I just think, for a Company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff, the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount. Of course, Jamie is right, but it's always going to be situational, it's always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is. I mean, in your question you alluded to it, it's like if the 10-year note's at 3, and we're sure it's not going to 5, but then where's the rest of the yield curve, what are the other options, what's going on in that moment. So we're always going to be situational and tactical about it. Matthew O\u2019Connor: That's helpful. And then kind of squeeze in, you've announced a bunch of what most of us have characterized as relatively small acquisitions, some this quarter and obviously, looking back for the full year. Is there something that -- is there a way you could kind of size the capital impact of that?  I know most of the terms weren't disclosed individually, but any way to frame the capital and financial impact? And then just lastly, remind us, what is the driving force when you look for a deal? Because some of the deals you look at and you're like how does that fit into broader JPMorgan Chase? Thank you. Jamie Dimon : The capital impact in total isn't that big a deal and we're not going to disclose any more nor is the immediate financial impact. And each one is different. So in Consumer, Jeremy already said, it's more about lifestyle, travel, lounges, millennial, stuff like that.  In asset management of products, there was [Indiscernible] products, ESG products, timber products, stuff like that. And then between NutMeg and C6 and stuff like that, that is a longer-term view of us trying to get positioned into retail overseas over 10 years if we can. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Great. Thank you. Operator : Next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Jeremy, you were saying that -- when we were talking earlier about the potential SLR changes and such, and we haven't seen anything in [Indiscernible] leaving today. But you mentioned about maybe the [Indiscernible] is focus on the Basel III end game, that's coming very soon here. Can you share with us from your guy's perspective, what are you focusing on with the Basel III final rules and regulations that could affect your growth going forward? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So I think, I mean, the thing about the Basel III End Game is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the Basel floors -- the Basel standardized floors and the Collins floor. So you need to simultaneously -- so from the perspective of the staff that's working on this stuff, they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place the U.S. rule, which is Basel compliant, while also complying with the Collins floor standardized or WA minimum.  And so that's complicated and it's hard and it's quite technical and that sort of explains why it's taking a little bit longer than we might have all otherwise thought. In terms of the impact of that on our long-term growth, I mean at a high level, it's unlikely to be significant.  I think the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these non-risk sensitive size-based constraints like G7 SLR, where obviously, most prominently in the case of GSIB, it's really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was. And to a very significant degree are driven by the expansion of the system that we've seen in the last 18 months. So that's why we believe that that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original role. And so across all of those potential changes, you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those.  You can imagine that Basel III endgame in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital efficient at the margin. But we're a big diversified Company. We're pretty good at navigating this stuff. So when we have clarity, we'll make the necessary tweaks. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then obviously, you in the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year-over-year basis. I think your deposits are up 20% all-in. You talked specifically about retail being the number one market share and retail deposits.  When the Fed ends QE, assuming it does some time by the middle of next year, and I'm not asking you guys to forecast what your deposits are going to be, but just higher level, should we anticipate that deposits could actually decline?  Or know that they are going to be so sticky even with the liquidity that everybody carriers, that we shouldn't really see a decline in deposits after QE, and this, let's call it second half, for next year? Jeremy Barnum : I think there's a couple of factors in here. So let's, for the sake of argument, set our RP aside for a second and hold that constant -- if you just look at the impact of QE on system-wide deposits, we talked about tapering, but as I said earlier, tapering still involves another 0.5 trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering, or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering.  If the Fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time, there would be an extended pause between the end of QE and the beginning of QT. And again, setting our IPO aside for a second, it would only really be with the beginning of QT that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking, and I think the timing the last time if I remember correctly, was something like 22 months between the end of QE and the beginning of QT.  Now, of course, RP could bounce around and there could be other factors, but at a high level, that's how we're thinking about it. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Jamie Dimon : I will just add my two cents. I think that they'll have to go quicker than that, and they'll have to reverse some of it. So you're talking about we're still going to increase deposits for a year, and then there will be a fairly large reduction over a 2 or 3-year period, which we should be prepared for. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Please, proceed. Charles Peabody : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get a progress report on your new headquarter building. Specifically, what's the projected move-in date, or has that been affected by the pandemic? Secondly, are there costs, noticeable costs, running through 2021, expense structure for that build-out? And does that tick up noticeably when you move in? And then thirdly, what's the plan for unloading the properties that you'll be vacating and how is that being affected by the current real estate market? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : So the plan is on schedule moving date 20, I think 2025. There is no material expense, of course, it's duplicate expenses and we got to sell the building, stuff like that, but nothing material to our shareholder. We need to disclose. Operator, are there any other questions? Operator : Yes, sir. That is coming from [Indiscernible] from Societe Generale. Please proceed. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So you put, Jamie, about how you all focusing on inflation. Just wondering if you could outline what you're looking at exactly metric-wise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually materializing with the concern. And how will that payout versus your expectations?  In terms of, like, how we deal with this if it does materialize as concerned, is there anything that you can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there? Jamie Dimon : Yeah, I think we should look at the big picture here, which, I think, is always important. I mean, 2 years ago we were facing COVID, virtually a great depression, global pandemic. And that's all in the back mirror, which is good. So by hopefully a year from now, there will be no supply chain problems.  The pandemic will become endemic. and I think it's very good to have good healthy growth, which we have. And it'll be good to have unemployment of 4%, it's good that their jobs are open, I think it's good that wages went up [Indiscernible], and I think there's too much focus on -- and none of these changes how we run the business, which to we add clients all the time. Consumer, card, auto, deposits, real estate, small business, large companies, and stuff like that, which is the underlying thing to drive JPMorgan. It's not whether they take your revolver from 25% to 27%. So having said all that, and I'm not focused on inflation; we simply have pointed out -- well, you have [Indiscernible] inflation. It's 4%. It's been 4% now for the better part of a couple of quarters and it's, in my view, unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that. Another question is, does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages? More people looking for work or does it continue to go up? And of course, we prepare for probabilities and eventualities and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think and they'll have to tamp down.  I doubt that will happen before late 2022. In the meantime, I think it's unbelievable that we're getting out of this and we have 4% unemployment, and you can have good growth with some inflation, and that's okay. I think that people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns. If you have inflation of 4% or 5%, we're still going to open deposit accounts, checking accounts, and grow our business. I also should point out because it's always in the back of my mind, about $30 billion of revenues, 20 billion in subscription revenues. Asset Management, commercial banking, consumer banking, which are pretty good.  Wholesale payments, security services, custody, and so we're pretty crowded with the people who've accomplished all this, that if you look at the actual underlying numbers to getting earnings per second, more customers, more accounts, more share. And at the end of the day, that is what drives everything. Andrew Lim : Okay. That's great. It seems like you're taking a benign view, and it's manageable, it's not going to get out of hand. Which is fair enough. Jamie Dimon : It's not -- I'm telling you. I don't -- I'm sorry, [Indiscernible] I don't know. We're prepared for all eventualities. There may be effect Gelb inflation. And the one other thing about our balance sheet, you guys talked about, putting your stuff like that. One of the stack tails of banks do, that are banks should be worried about is high inflation and high rates. And we have been very liquid, protects us more than against that and other things. Andrew Lim : Right, got it. Thanks for the clarity on that. And just a short follow-on question, Remy. Could you update us on the number of excess provisions you've got versus your base case economics scenario, you've given that number in the past and perhaps a bit of color more so on how that base case has changed over the quarter if it has indeed? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. I think the base case -- the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarter-on-quarter in light of the revisions and GDP outlook. But as you know, the framework also involves looking at probability-weighted scenarios. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter.  In terms of sizing the overall balance, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the COVID -related unusual features, i.e. uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now, or uncertainty about labor market conditions, or the fact that even though a lot of the -- essentially all the federal level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too.  There are still some forms of assistance. The mortgage foreclosure moratorium, student loan stuff, rent moratoria, stuff like that, that don't roll off until later in the year. So there's a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual, which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have. And as things play out, those will develop. Jamie Dimon : Jeremy, just to interrupt real quickly. I got to go because I am out of town I have meetings I have to go to. You guys should continue and folks, thanks for listening to us and we'll talk to you all soon. Jeremy Barnum : All right. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : And by that, we have no further questions waiting. Jeremy Barnum : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Everyone, that marks the end of our call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining. Enjoy the rest of your Enjoy the rest of day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. It\u2019s slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year. Starting with the fourth quarter on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $10.4 billion, EPS of $3.33 on revenue of $30.3 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 19%. These results included a $1.8 billion net credit reserve release, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. Adjusting for this, we delivered a 17% ROTCE this quarter. Touching on a few highlights, as we suggested last quarter, we have started to see a pickup in loan growth, 8% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter ex-PPP, with a significant portion of this growth coming from AWM and Markets. But we\u2019re also seeing positive indicators in card, as well as increasing revolver utilization and C&I. And it was an exceptionally strong quarter for Investment Banking, particularly M&A, as well as another good quarter in AWM. On page 2, we have some more detail on the fourth quarter. Revenue of $30.3 billion was up 1% year-on-year. Net interest income was up 3%, primarily driven by balance sheet growth, partially offset by lower CIB Markets NII, and NIR was down 1%, largely driven by normalization in CIB Markets and lower production revenue in home lending, mostly offset by higher IB fees on strong advisory. You\u2019ll notice that we\u2019ve added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show NII and NIR, excluding Markets, as well as the third line of standalone Markets total revenue, which as we said before, is more consistent with the way we run the Company. We\u2019ll be keeping this format going forward and you\u2019ll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook. If you look at things on this basis, the drivers are the same, but the numbers are a little different. NII, excluding Markets, is up 4%; NIR, excluding Markets, is up 3%; and Markets is down 11% on normalization. Expenses of $17.9 billion were up $1.8 billion or 11%, largely on higher compensation and credit costs were a net benefit of $1.3 billion, reflecting reserve releases. Looking at the full year results on page 3, the Firm reported net income of $48.3 billion, EPS of $15.36, and record revenue of $125.3 billion. We delivered a return on tangible common equity of 23% or 18%, excluding the reserve releases. And then, onto reserves on page 4. We released $1.8 billion this quarter, reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment. Our outlook remains constructive, but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment. On the balance sheet and capital on page 5, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13%, up slightly, and reflecting nearly $5 billion of capital distributions to shareholders, including $1.9 billion of net repurchases. With that, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with consumer and community banking on page 6. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion, including reserves releases of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $12.3 billion was down 4% year-on-year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card, partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer and business banking. Many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter. Deposits were up 20% year-on-year and 4%, sequentially, and client investment assets were up 22% year-on-year, about evenly split between market performance and flows. Combined credit and debit spend was up 27% versus the fourth quarter of \u201819 with each quarter in 2021 showing sequential growth compared to 2019. Within that, travel and entertainment spend was up 13% versus 4Q \u201819, but we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the Omicron wave. Card outstandings were up 5% year-on-year, but remain down 8% versus 4Q \u201819. However, it\u2019s promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in May of 2021, since then, they\u2019ve kept pace with 2019 growth rates. In home lending, loans were down 1% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter as prepayments have slowed. And it was another strong quarter for originations, totaling $42.2 billion, up 30% year-on-year. In fact, it was the highest fourth quarter since 2012, driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes. In auto, average loans were up 7% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. After several strong quarters, the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to $8.5 billion, down 23% year-on-year. So overall, loans ex-PPP, were up 2% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by card and auto, and expenses of $7.8 billion were up 10% year-on-year on higher compensation, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $11.5 billion for the fourth quarter. And for the full year, net income was $21 billion on record revenue of $52 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $3.2 billion was up 28% versus the prior year and up 6% sequentially. IB fees were up 37% year-on-year, primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory. And we maintained our number one rank with a full year wallet share of 9.5%. In advisory, we were up 86% and it was the third consecutive all time record quarter, benefiting from elevated M&A volumes that continued throughout 2021, specifically for midsized deals. Debt underwriting fees were up 14%, driven by an active leverage loan market, primarily linked to acquisition financing. And in equity underwriting, fees were up 12%, primarily driven by our strong performance in IPOs. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.3 billion, down 11% against a record fourth quarter last year. Compared to 2019, we were up 7%, driven by a strong performance in equities. Fixed income was down 16% year-on-year, reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter, especially in rates, as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies, emerging markets, credit and commodities. Equity markets were down 2% on $2 billion of revenue, as continued strength in Prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives. For the full year, equities revenue was $10.5 billion, up 22% at an all-time record. It was a particularly strong year for both Investment Banking and Markets. And looking ahead, we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in 2022. However, for purposes of the first quarter in Investment Banking, the overall pipeline remains quite robust. Payments revenue was $1.8 billion, up 26% year-on-year or up 7% excluding net gains on equity investments. And the year-on-year growth was from higher fees and deposits, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was flat year-on-year. Expenses of $5.8 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume related and legal expenses. And credit costs were not benefit of $126 million, driven by the reserve release, I mentioned upfront. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion and an ROE of 20%. Revenue of $2.6 billion was up 6% year-on-year on record Investment Banking revenue, driven by continued strength in M&A and acquisition related financing. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses. Deposits were up 8% sequentially on seasonality. Loans were down 1% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 4% ex-PPP, primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased short-term financing and corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 1% with higher new loan originations, offset by net payoff activity. And credit costs were a net benefit of $89 million, driven by reserve releases with net charge-offs of 2 basis points. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with a pretax margin of 34%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher performance related compensation and distribution fees. For the quarter, net long-term term inflows were $34 billion and for the full year were positive across all channels, asset classes and regions, totaling a record of $164 billion. AUM of $3.1 trillion and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion, up 15% and 18% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in custom lending, mortgages and securities-based lending while deposits were up 15% sequentially. Turning to corporate on page 10. Corporate reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. Revenue was a loss of $545 million, down $296 million year-on-year. NII was up $160 million, primarily on higher rates, mostly offset by continued deposit growth. And NIR was down $456 million, primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments. Expenses of $251 million were down $110 million year-on-year. So with that, as we close the books on 2021, we think it\u2019s important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the COVID period, and then pivot to discussing the 2022 and medium-term outlook. So, turning to page 11, what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period, especially when you strip out the reserve builds and subsequent releases in 2020 and 2021. If you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom left-hand side of the page, you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits. NII, ex-Markets, was down nearly 20% on the headwinds of lower rates and card revolve that we\u2019ve discussed throughout the year. This was partially offset by significant NIR growth ex-Markets, largely from higher IB fees and AWM management and performance fees. And we also saw strength across products and regions in CIB Markets, as the extraordinary market environment in 2020 did not normalize as much as we expected in 2021. So, when you look across the Company, we saw consistent modest revenue growth, as well as good performance in the areas that we control, notably, staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively, resulting in quite stable returns, once again proving the power of the JPMorgan Chase platform. So, turning to the next page. The strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that we\u2019re prepared for the long-term. On the left hand side of the page, you can see the expense drivers from 2019 to 2021. The first bar is structural. And while the growth of 2% is modest over the two-year period, that includes some COVID-related effects that we would see as temporary including, for example, lower T&E spend and elevated employee attrition. And we do expect some catch-up in those effects as we look forward. Then, the middle bar is $3.4 billion of growth in volume and revenue-related expenses. Some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation, primarily from Investment Banking, Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance. And remember, we\u2019ve seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in AWM and CCB. So, don\u2019t assume all of this is CIB as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets in fee wallet goes one way and AUM goes the opposite way. And then, this bar also includes volume-related non-comp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees, some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because they\u2019re offset with revenue gross-ups. Then, the last bar of $1.7 billion, as previewed with you this time last year, is a result of our investment agenda, which we\u2019ve been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our longstanding priorities. You can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the right hand side of the page, $9.6 billion growing to $11.3 billion across the categories that we\u2019ve often discussed. We\u2019re continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network. Then marketing, where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a full year spend comparable to 2019. And tech, which we\u2019ve broadened to include tech adjacent spend, reflecting our recognition, the tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics, AI as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers. And what\u2019s really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments, which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns. So, over the next few pages, let\u2019s double click into some of these investment areas to see what we\u2019re doing, starting with examples of marketing and distribution on page 13. We\u2019ve expanded our reach across the U.S. and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous 48 states, an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans. We also continue to expand internationally, including 13 international markets as part of our Commercial Bank expansion, China in both our CIB and AWM businesses, and in the UK with Chase UK, where we\u2019ve seen exciting progress since we launched in September, although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall. We continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking, private banking and wealth management, really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share. And as I just said, the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the Company. So, we\u2019re not making short-term claims about share outcome causality. But as you can see at the bottom of the page, our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the Company. Turning to page 14. In addition to all of our distribution-related investments, a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over $12 billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it, change the bank spend. It\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s in the investment category. About half of that is foundational and mandatory, which includes regulatory-related investments, modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future. On the left hand side, you can see some more detail around this. Modernization, which includes migrations to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture, data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary data set by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it, attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills, and a product operating model, which is obviously a popular buzzword these days. But if you look through all that, it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with end-to-end ownership. Underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the Firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment. Moving to the right hand side. The other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our client-facing products. We believe it\u2019s critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience. And we\u2019re attacking the problem with a combination of building, partnering and buying. And so, a few examples of that. On the retail side, we\u2019ve been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like Chase MyHome and launch a cloud native digital bank with our recent Chase UK launch. On the wholesale side, we continue to innovate on our Execute trading platform, commercialized blockchain through Onyx and are building out real-time payments capabilities. In addition, our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies. And you can see several examples of this on the page. So, taken together, our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there, whether we\u2019re the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale. With that, let\u2019s talk about the outlook and the year ahead, starting on page 15. As you\u2019ll remember from Daniel\u2019s comments in December, the 17% that we have talked about as a medium-term ROTCE target is not realistic for 2022. We do expect to see some tailwinds to NII, including the benefit of the latest implied and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase. But the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet, and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary pressures. However, despite these potential challenges for the near-term outlook, we do continue to believe in 17% ROTCE as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher and we realized business growth, driven by our investments. So, let us try to give you more detail around forward-looking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds. So first, the rate curve. Our central case does not require a return to a 2.5% Fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in 625 basis-point hikes over the next three years. Assuming we realize the forward curve, from there, we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus 175 basis points of ROTCE impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case. And of course, there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there, which could produce different outcomes over the near term. In this illustration, the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve, more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience. And of course, what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on NII, but for the performance of the Company as a whole, credit matters a lot. And the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that. In markets and banking, we feel good about the share we\u2019ve taken, and there are reasons why the beginning of a rate hiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular, at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of post-COVID revenue normalization. In our central case, markets and banking normalized somewhat in 2022 relative to their respective record years in 2020 and 2021, and resume modest growth thereafter. The downside case assumes a return to 2019 trend line levels with sub-GDP growth rates, whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels. As we\u2019ve been discussing in consumer, the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moment of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve, even as spend has started to return. In our central case, we assume healthy sales growth from the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions. And that, combined with relatively constant revolve rates, generates a strong recovery in revolving balances. But there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior, which could be a source of downside. And in that scenario, revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the long-term pre-pandemic averages, resulting in approximately 50 basis points of downside relative to our central case. Of course, there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside. And then, let\u2019s touch on inflation for a second, which is obviously increasingly relevant. On balance, modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us. But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit, which could represent around 75 basis points of downside. And while it\u2019s not on the page, another key driver is capital, where even though we remain hopeful, our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher CET1, reflecting that we finished the year in the 4.5% GSIB bucket which equates to a 1% increase from GSIB in the central case. Although as a reminder, that does not become binding until 2024. This is a good opportunity to point out that QE deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxy by GDP growth of the factors in the original 2015 rule release combined represent two full GSIB buckets. So, in the absence of those, we would still be in the 3.5% bucket. With that in mind, any recalibration could be a tailwind. And each 1% change in the CET1 level is worth about 150 basis points of ROTCE. And to be clear, for simplicity, we\u2019ve assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page. So, when we take a step back, 17% remains our central case in the medium term. But over the next one to two years, we expect to earn modestly below that target. In light of all that, let\u2019s talk about near-term guidance on page 16. We expect NII, excluding Markets, to be roughly $50 billion in 2022, up approximately $5.5 billion from 2021. As I mentioned upfront, this is a change relative to how we\u2019ve previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of Markets\u2019 NII can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottom line neutral. Looking at the key drivers of that for 2022, there are a few major factors. Rates, with the market implied suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the reason steepening of the yield curve, we would expect to see about $2.5 billion more NII from that effect. You can see at the bottom right, we\u2019ve shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10-K, reflecting the year-end rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition. And as we note in our quarterly filings, there are lots of reasons to be careful in trying to use EAR to predict NII changes under real-world conditions. But at a high level, if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and what\u2019s happening to the yield curve recently, you should find the $2.5 billion increase relatively intuitive. Then, balance sheet growth and mix, where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to 2019 levels, and also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of 2021 and into 2022. And partially offsetting both of those factors is the roll-off of PPP. So, while we do expect NII to increase year-on-year, depending on the path of rates, it may take a couple of years to return to the full NII generating capacity of the Company. Turning to page 17. As we said at the outset of this section, we are in for a couple of years of sub-target returns. Despite this, we are going to continue to invest and we\u2019re not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions. And so, looking at adjusted expenses, we expect roughly $77 billion in 2022, an increase of about $6 billion year-on-year or 8%. And before we go into the breakdown, it\u2019s worth noting, while the year-on-year increase is eye-catching, a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of 2021 across various categories. So starting with the first bucket on the page, which is the structural expense increase. As I alluded to earlier, we are seeing some catch-up this year, both from the impact of inflation and our compensation expenses as well as higher non-comp expense with the resumption of T&E. Then, volume and revenue-related expenses. Remember that this is both comp and non-comp. From a comp perspective, to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues, there should be a tailwind here. But keep in mind a couple of points. The normalization assumption for Markets and IB fees at this point is pretty modest. And our assumption for AUM is for modest increases. At the same time, we have the impact of volume growth on non-comp, both in wholesale and in consumer, which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation. And most importantly, we are adding another $3.5 billion of investments, which I would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that I just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones I discussed earlier. As I wrap up, it\u2019s another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earnings generating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the Company. So, in closing, on page 18, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last two years. Not only the business results, some of which are highlighted here on the page, but also continuing to serve our customers, clients and communities, and importantly, executing on our strategic priorities. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the long term. And while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic, we\u2019ve never felt better about the Company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape. So, with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, and it\u2019s on page 16. And it\u2019s a two-part question on this guidance. The first is, could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit beta that you presume in this $50 billion number as well as the size of securities deployment? And the second part to that question is, clearly, we\u2019re missing that white box, right, in terms of CIB markets contribution. And if you could give us sort of rails to think about CIB markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive? Jeremy Barnum : Right. Okay. So, three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we\u2019re assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn\u2019t before. So, that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So, it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we\u2019re assuming a reprice experience that\u2019s similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But, if you\u2019re looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card. And then, in terms of Markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to Markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of relevant places, like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus future positions, which is the example I\u2019d like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there\u2019s a couple of things we could suggest. So, if you look at the supplement, we\u2019ve actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So, you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you address that thing against the Fed funds rate, you\u2019ll actually see that there\u2019s a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So, it\u2019s sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection. Erika Najarian : Very clear. Thank you. My second compound question is on capital. If you could give us an update -- I know that January 1st is the adoption date for SA-CCR, if you could give us an estimate on the impact of CET1? And just to clarify, that 17% medium-term ROTCE does take into account that your GSIB surcharge is 4.5%? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So, as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So, that does mean 4.5% GSIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So, I think if you do the math, that\u2019s like 10 basis points of CET1. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please proceed. John McDonald : Hey Jeremy, I want to follow up on that. Maybe a broader discussion on how you\u2019re managing the capital constraints, the SLR and the rising GSIB. And what does it mean for balancing share buybacks, which obviously reduced this quarter, preferred issuance and other levers that you have? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that\u2019s at the bottom of our capital stack. So, to the extent that we\u2019re seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don\u2019t want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes, the capital build. But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that we\u2019re making. And frankly, we\u2019re kind of happy about that. That\u2019s just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks. John McDonald : Okay. And then, as the follow-up, maybe compound follow-up. The new CET1 target or where you expect to kind of run this year, if you could clarify that. And also, any color on the modest normalization of the FICC and equities wallets that you could flush out? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table. And that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel III endgame, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the minimum. But as you can see, and as I said in response to Erika a second ago, the 17% target assumes something closer to 13% as a function of the expected increases in GSIB and some other factors. So, we\u2019re kind of going to operate in that type of range throughout the year with obviously the flexibility that we have. And then, sorry, you also asked about normalization of markets and IB fees. I mean, I would say, if you\u2019d ask me in the middle of the year, we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to 2019 run rate was a thing that like could happen in theory. The way we feel right now, our central case is obviously that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance, both in IB fees and in Markets. But I think we\u2019re expecting that normalization to be a little bit less, like we\u2019re near all the way down to the 2019 levels, partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust. We feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there. And then in fixed income, we\u2019ve already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually. And as the monetary policy environment evolves next year, that could actually create some tailwinds for that business. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next up, we have Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you very much. I wonder if I could ask a little follow-up on the expense side. Slide 17 breaks a lot out. First, I\u2019m curious on -- if I overgeneralize and say, 40% used called structural comp normalization, a 60% investment. And thank you, I just saw a further breakout in the bottom of the slide. But the question I have is how much of that 60%, the higher volume, the investments, has investments made? In other words, you made 11 either M&A deals or investments over the last like 15 months. How much of that is related to that coming through the P&L, or straight up brand-new investments for \u201822 entering for all those items that you listed below? Jeremy Barnum : Right. Okay. I think I get your question, Glenn. So, number one, to the extent that we\u2019ve done some M&A over the last 15 months, as you allude to, and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate, the run rate impact of that is in the $3.5 billion. It\u2019s a relatively modest contribution. On the top of my head, I want to say it\u2019s probably like $300 million or something like that. So, it could be a little bit more, depending on some factors. So, that\u2019s one point. The other point is that there are different types of investments here. So, if you look at, for example, the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card, a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year. So, that\u2019s actually already in the run rate. Whereas other aspects of the investment agenda are obviously thinks that we\u2019re executing now, expanding in places, hiring people, hiring technologists to do things that we need to do. So hopefully that answers your question. Glenn Schorr : And maybe if I could just ask a very general question, I think people get normalizing capital markets and a higher investment spend when it adds up to falling short of the 17% over time target. The question -- the simple question I have is the fact that you\u2019ve mentioned multiyear shortfall, is that a function of timing of NII going full run rate with the timing of capital markets short off and the high denominator, as you just answered with John\u2019s question? Jeremy Barnum : Your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question, and I think the simple answer is yes. So, in other words, we\u2019re sort of saying that as we -- as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve formalization as well as run rate normalization and Markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth in our Markets and Investment Banking revenues with the background expectation of growth, and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So, you can kind of see -- it\u2019s not that long, if you know what I mean, in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment. Jamie Dimon : Glenn, I would just like to add, we don\u2019t really know about 2023, and I\u2019d be very cautious in that. Plus, I expect more interest rates increases is in the implied curve. And obviously, the world is very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if you can get that to the rest of our lives would be exceptional. So, reconfirming that that\u2019s kind of what we do, we can do is pretty good. By the way, I would say 15% on tangible for the rest of my life, if I can guarantee that. Operator : Next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I wanted to ask you just a couple of more questions on loans. You mentioned that you\u2019re starting to see some better activity. I wanted to just ask if you can kind of just flesh out what you\u2019re seeing across corporate lending, commercial lending, noticing that the wholesale-related commitments were actually down 3% sequentially. So, can you kind of just talk us through what clients are saying and doing? And just how strong can that rebound on the corporate and commercial side could we see as we go forward? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Yes. So, in terms of C&I loan growth, as I said in the script, we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates, especially in the commercial bank. And it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients. But, we are starting to see an uptick in that actually even in the bigger clients. So, that gets an encouraging sign. One of the things I\u2019ve heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is CEOs and management teams who\u2019ve been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems, wanting to run higher inventories, and that is maybe driving higher utilization there which, as a result, while it would, I guess, theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth. But at the same time, we\u2019re also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the C-suites and all else equal, that should be positive for C&I loan growth. But clearly, the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment-grade issuance, in particular, and more recently, the high-yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period. And so, people are well funded from capital markets issuance. Ken Usdin : Okay. Second question is just on fees. There are a couple of zigs and zags in mortgage banking, security servicing, which were both down a little bit more than expected. And card did get a little bit better. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of color on the drivers of each of those, please? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. So, let me do mortgage and cards. So, in mortgage, you\u2019ll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there. So, there\u2019s a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So, that\u2019s one factor. In addition, you actually -- we did -- despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter of originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on. So, that\u2019s a little of a factor. And then there\u2019s the sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit. So, you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And though obviously with higher rates we expect things to be weaker next year, we\u2019re still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which by historical standards is very robust. So, that\u2019s that part. And then, in card, I imagine that you\u2019re looking at the card income line where we had a significant drop last quarter. And this quarter, the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you\u2019ll remember that for card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter, depressing the number. This quarter, we have another sort of one-offish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So, that\u2019s contributing to the card income line, the revenue rate a little bit. But it\u2019s important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization comfort revenue expense, which, as you know, amortizes over 12 months. And so, as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as part of the reopening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly, 100,000 point offers in the market and stuff like that. And so, that\u2019s coming through the numbers. So, as a result, when you look at the sort of full year revenue rate for card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we\u2019ve laid out. Operator : So, that question is from Jim Mitchell coming from Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Just you guys are doubling the investment spend. So clearly seeing success in the prior efforts. So, could you just give us a little bit big picture discussion on what you\u2019re seeing from a return on investment standpoint and what time frame? Because I think you kind of alluded to 2023 still being a little bit subpar in return. So, does that mean the payback is a little longer and you still expect significant growth in investment spend in \u201823? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, I mean, at some level, the question that you\u2019re asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that we\u2019re making are paying back and on what time line and how do we measure that? And it\u2019s interesting. We were just talking about card marketing. I think of that as a continuum. You have a continuum of investments that start with card marketing where every dollar that we put into card marketing investment as part of a very sophisticated, extremely data-driven, highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term. So, there\u2019s a lot of signs there, and it\u2019s pretty precise and you get feedback pretty quickly. At the other end of the continuum is tech modernization type stuff, which is a big part of the theme right now. And those things are things that are just we obviously need to do them. If we don\u2019t do them, we\u2019ll be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when we\u2019re trying to compete. And it\u2019s impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that there is a tangible return payback from that, but we know that they\u2019re absolutely mandatory. So, when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate, we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that we\u2019re making now and that we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon. But, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is not of that nature. And in some sense, those are actually the most important investments because they\u2019re the hardest decisions to make. Jamie Dimon : And some are very basic. Opening 400 branches, $800 million a year, obviously, the payback comes over time, adding thousand of sales people kind of know pretty much what the payback is, but obviously, it comes over time. And so it\u2019s a whole mix. And just think about it as expenses you should expect to go up a little bit in 2023. Jim Mitchell : All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow-up on -- just on the NII. I think futures markets are now pricing in four hikes. I think you have three in your assumptions. If we do get a four hikes starting in March, is that a material change to the NII outlook for this year in your models? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, if you look at the bottom left-hand side of page 16, footnote 3, an extremely small print, you will note that the implied curve that we use is from January 5th. So, you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveat that I won\u2019t give you and draw your own conclusions. But I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind, very modest. While we wait for the next question, I said something inaccurate before. I realized I wasn\u2019t that confident when I said that. The $40 billion standardized RWA increase in SA-CCR, if you do the math, is obviously not 10 basis points of CET1. It\u2019s 30 basis points of CET1. So, correction coming through there. Operator : We have a question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, a couple of questions. First, on the NII outlook. Could you give us a sense as to what\u2019s embedded in that with regard to your thoughts on how balance sheet shrinkage at the Fed, right, the QT is going to impact the liquidity pool? And then, how much of that liquidity pool you currently are assuming is going to get redeployed into more duration in your forward look? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, I mean, I forget exactly what the market is assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they\u2019re now calling it. But from us, I look closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly. And therefore, the impact on system-wide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And that -- and our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we\u2019re not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because ultimately that\u2019s going to be primarily a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I\u2019m saying. And so, then, in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So, we\u2019re still being quite cautious about really buying duration. And if you look at again page 16, you noticed that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that\u2019s tied as balance sheet growth and mix. So, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that we might be -- we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict, but it shouldn\u2019t be too dramatic. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then, my second question is just on the investments, the $3.5 billion that you\u2019ve got incremental here. And I assume that this is built up, bottoms off from business unit leaders\u2019 requests to do everything that you mentioned in the call. And my question here is what percentage roughly like just got numbers, but what percentage are you giving them this year? In other words, do they ask for 7, you\u2019re giving them 3.5 and we should expect another uptick materially in 2023? I know, Jamie, you mentioned 77 is a run rate that we should grow from next year. But I\u2019m kind of asking a slightly different question, which is how much of what they need are you giving them this year? And a subset question is, at what point -- does this fully fund your ability to get into the cloud for U.S. consumer? Jamie Dimon : I answer that question. We do not sit at the table and tell people you can only do X. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do? So, think of it\u2019s 100% within our capability because some things you just simply can\u2019t do. You can\u2019t attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. And that\u2019s number one. So, we want to make those kind of investments. Each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and do NPV. I was like just don\u2019t do an NPV. Just get it done. That\u2019s just serving your client properly and stuff like that. And so -- and like as I said, a lot -- I mean, Jeremy mentioned it\u2019s 400 branch in the United States. It\u2019s 13 sites overseas. It\u2019s more countries, more products. It\u2019s all the things we should be doing that you\u2019d want to do if you owned 100% of the Company. So, it may not be what you do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y or Z or something like that. And the second part of your question wasn\u2019t that, it was -- the consumer digital and stuff like that. We\u2019re not going to start giving you real numbers and all that, but that is a march. That\u2019s a journey, and it\u2019s hard. And we want to get there as soon as possible. Pieces and pockets have already gotten there. So certain applications and certain datasets already running on the private cloud, somewhere in the public cloud, some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the companies, that\u2019s a lot of work. And there is -- you guys have pointed a little bit call it bubbles expression there. We\u2019re not going to disclose that either because then we just got a doctor closing 84 other bubble expenses. Those are our responsibility. And to the extent we have opportunities to do more, we will do more. We have extraordinary capability. And I think I also want to point out, Jeremy, you mentioned the assumptions around capital. I mean, SLR, G-SIFI, and most of these other companies should be recalibrated, okay? Even the regular these things should be recalibrated for the global side, the global economy. If you put capital against treasuries and capital Fed deposits and let\u2019s see what happens. So, we -- on that, we\u2019re kind of conservative. We\u2019re not going to be expecting a lot of relief. But, even some of the folks yesterday we mentioned that were being questioned Fed prospects were being questioned about SLR and acknowledge that there are issues around SLR that are not good for the markets. Jeremy Barnum : And Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get 5. I mean, we would -- we aim to manage the Company much better than that. So, I certainly don\u2019t have that type of authority. That\u2019s not the way it works. And I think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda, two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So that\u2019s where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now, whether it\u2019s the right priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether in the case of where the returns are measurable, where it\u2019s producing the right returns. And that\u2019s really part of how we operate the Company and part of the discipline of the day to day. Jamie Dimon : I\u2019d like to give you another example. If we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second. Betsy Graseck : But, the step function that we see this year -- I mean, given the pace of competition and the impact of everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s possible we could see this type of step function again. Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s possible. But if it happens, it will be for a good reason. And I read about the competition, the global competition, the nonbank competition, direct fiber lending competition, there\u2019s Jane Street [ph] competition, the [indiscernible] competition, there\u2019s fintech competition, there\u2019s PayPal competition, there\u2019s direct competition, it\u2019s a lot of competition, and we intend to win. And sometimes you guys spend a few bucks. Betsy Graseck : All right. I got it. Thanks. Jamie Dimon : And I want to emphasize, too, embedded upon that, as we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re going to -- we want to be very, very competitive and pay. There\u2019s a $1 billion in merit increase. There\u2019s a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who actually say, by the way, did an extraordinary job in the last couple of years delivering this stuff. And we will be competitive and pay. And that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it. Operator : Next up, we have Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : So, I want to start off with a question on capital. Carlos highlighted in his one-song speech, the potential for Basel IV implementation, increasing capital requirements as much as 20% for select banks. While we haven\u2019t seen a formal proposal from the Fed, I was just hoping you could provide just some preliminary thoughts how you\u2019re handicapping the risk of higher RWA inflation ahead of Basel IV adoption? And to what extent is that contemplated in the updated ROTCE guidance? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So Steve... Jamie Dimon : Don\u2019t give too much... Jeremy Barnum : This is fine. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable question. So, okay. So, here you go. So, when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel III endgame or Basel IV proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you\u2019ve got the change in the credit conversion factors, which all else equal is a tailwind. You\u2019ve got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and it\u2019s going to depend institution by institution, but it\u2019s potentially for some folks a headwind. And then, you\u2019ve got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there\u2019s a bunch of RWA inflation. But, a couple of things. First, there\u2019s all things plays in the context of the global regulatory community or at least in the U.S. saying that the system has enough capital. And it doesn\u2019t actually need more capital. And it\u2019s important to realize\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Which by the way, anyone does any real analysis at all would come to that conclusion. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And so, it is important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA, and then in turn, how that interacts potentially with the Collins Floor as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak, potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So, the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation. And the way we see the world, we don\u2019t expect the Basel III endgame in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company. Jamie Dimon : And you were conservative in saying, it\u2019s the 4.5% G-SIFI. Jeremy Barnum : Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium-term ROTCE assumptions. Steve Chubak : Thanks for clarifying that and for now punting on the topic, Basel IV. Just for my follow-up here... Jamie Dimon : We will very, very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers, like very aggressively manage them. Steve Chubak : Fair enough, Jamie. You certainly have the track record that supports that. Just for my follow-up on card payment normalization. How are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates? And just maybe to speak to your confidence level that we see card payment rates return to pre-pandemic levels, just given the emerging threats from BNPL that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios. But I think it\u2019s a little bit simpler. If you just take a step back, you look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. So, there\u2019s a few things to note. So, the revolve rate having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized. There\u2019s a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff. But broadly, it\u2019s stabilized. In the meantime, the growth in overall Card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So, what\u2019s important about that is that we\u2019re not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019re simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth therefore contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so, the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly. And then, sorry, Steve, I think you had another -- was there another part of that question that I forgot? Steve Chubak : No, no. That\u2019s sufficient. That\u2019s perfect. Operator : Next, we have Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. As we think about the 17% medium-term target, can you help frame what you think or what\u2019s being assumed on the efficiency ratio, and then maybe on credit costs as well, please? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, in terms of credit cost, as I said, we\u2019re assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point. So that would mean card charge-off rates back into the sort of low to mid-3s type of thing. As we said, pre-pandemic, we were assuming we would get to, especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time. Jamie Dimon : And building reserves as the loan books grow. Jeremy Barnum : Importantly, Yes, exactly. So, I mean, I would just broadly describe, and consistently with the way we\u2019re describing it, which is kind of medium-term guidance in a normalized environment that the charge-off environment should, in turn, be normal. So, that\u2019s that. And then, you\u2019re kind of asking me, I guess, about the overhead ratio a little bit. So personally, I kind of don\u2019t love that measure. I think it\u2019s more of an output than an input. And more often than not, it\u2019s driven by revenues, not expenses. And more often than not, in the short term, the revenue number that\u2019s swinging is a function of the rate curve. So essentially, the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the Fed funds rate, which makes it not a great management tool for the company. But having said that, in the assumptions that we\u2019re using to build up that 17% rate, we do get back to something like a 55% overhead ratio. But, as Jamie said before, if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns in the long term, it will, like we don\u2019t consider it to be a constraint. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Then obviously, the math implies to get back to 55%, you have kind of outside operating leverage for a few years, right? I mean because I think the efficiency ratio goes the wrong way again in \u201822 for the couple of years of pretty big operating leverage, right? Jamie Dimon : You\u2019ve got to do your own models, okay? Jeremy Barnum : In a world where there are inflationary pressures, there\u2019s a lot of post-pandemic effects in the numbers, and we have some critical investments to make. The notion of operating leverage at the level of the Company\u2019s overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful. I\u2019m not criticizing your question. I understand what you\u2019re asking, but is this kind of another way you think about it. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And I was just curious, Jamie, if you\u2019re mentioning -- still think grow more than expected. Obviously, expectations have moved up quite a bit. And I\u2019m just wondering kind of what\u2019s basing that opinion. And on a side bar, do you think the long end will go up or if it hasn\u2019t gone up yet, why will it from here? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Well, first of all, we prepare for all eventualities here. We\u2019re not kind of guessing at one. But the consumer is very strong. And with respect to the fact that people suffering still and COVID and all that, the fact is despite of Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever. And 2022, it looks like it either be 3.5% or 4%, which is actually pretty good. The consumer is $2 trillion more in their balance sheet, their home prices are up, asset prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, which is good for them. We\u2019re not against that, and sharing the wealth a little bit of Americas recovery with everybody. So, the consumer is in really good shape. The spending, I mean, Jeremy took you through the numbers, 25% more than they spent in pre-COVID. 25% more. And that number drives all the order books for everybody else, whether it\u2019s goods and services and obviously, it\u2019s bouncing around between goods and service dollar, kind of stuff like that. Businesses equally are in very good shape with cash and capability and confidence levels are high. What are they seeing? They\u2019re seeing their order books go up, more cars, more motors, more patios, more home improvements, more homes, more demand. We have a shortage of homes in America. So, you see the table is set pretty well with -- for the growth -- with obviously the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that. So, my view is a pretty good chance there\u2019ll be more than 4. It could be 6 or 7. I mean, I grew up in a world where you -- Paul Volcker raised interest 200 basis points on a Saturday night. And this whole notion that somehow it\u2019s going to be sweet and gentle and no one is ever going to be surprised. I think it\u2019s a mistake. That does not mean we won\u2019t have growth. It does not mean unemployment -- in a good position and stuff like that. And the other fact is, it may very well be possible that they\u2019re loan rates -- and I\u2019m a little surprised how low they stay. But the loan rates may react more to the actual QE and then QT. And so, at one point, the Fed is going to be letting run off $100 billion or whatever number a month they\u2019re going to come up with. And then you may see loan rates react a little bit to that. And particularly, I just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that, that also tends to drive 10-year bond rates and all that. So, all things being equal. If you look at the company, and it\u2019s very important, we have huge firepower to grow, to expand, to make loans to extend duration and you look at capital liquidity, I just want to point out, it\u2019s $1.7 trillion -- these numbers I\u2019ve never seen the bank with them. And you look at percentages, not just gross amounts, $1.7 trillion in cash and marketable securities, $1 trillion of loans, okay? There\u2019s $500 billion or $600 billion of those cash and marketable securities that could be deployed in higher-yielding assets or loans when and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that we have to deal with. And those are extraordinary numbers. It\u2019s $2.5 trillion deposits. And we don\u2019t like taking risky deposits. Those are -- they may go down a little bit in QT and all that. But look at how this balance sheet is funded. I\u2019ve never seen a bank balance sheet like that. And that\u2019s -- think of that as kind of firepower over time as we navigate through the world. And so, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. And if -- I wish I could own 100% of the company and be private. Matt O\u2019Connor: Can I just sneak in, based on all that, I was thinking, like the expense pressure or increase that we\u2019re seeing at JPMorgan or expect to see in \u201822, do you think this is indicative of the broader market as you talk to leaders outside of banks and they see the pipeline of volumes, do you think there\u2019s going to be material surprises on expenses for the broader market? Jamie Dimon : Yes, I would expect that because almost every CEO is talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that. But I just -- I don\u2019t want to be -- please don\u2019t say I\u2019m complaining about wages. I think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up. And businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices. So, if you -- commodity prices go up and down, mozzarella goes up and down, wages go up and down. They shouldn\u2019t be cried babies about. They just deal with it. The job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there. So I\u2019m not opposed to it. But I do think you\u2019ll see more people seeing wage pressure, et cetera, and some have more ability to offset it than others. It hasn\u2019t stopped us from doing anything, zero, none, nada. We\u2019re not cutting back in growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because there was some wage inflation. Operator : Next, we have a question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just two very quick follow-ups. One, Jeremy, in terms of capital deployment. Just talk to us about inorganic growth. Is there any likelihood that you look at any larger M&A transactions, use your currency at any point this year? And should we see a slowdown or a let up in the pace of inorganic fintech investments that you\u2019ve been on over the last year, if you could address those two? Jamie Dimon : So, the large transactions like over billions unlikely. But we always look. We\u2019re always open mind. We\u2019re looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that. And then the pace of fintech investors, stuff like that, that won\u2019t change at all. Jeremy Barnum : My version of that, which is consistent with Jamie\u2019s is that we continue to be interested in looking at M&A, and we\u2019re doing that. Obviously, yes, very large deals aren\u2019t realistic. And the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that we\u2019re looking at when we look at deals. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. And just double-clicking on something, Jamie, that you mentioned. You\u2019ve talked about when more square banks leaving the ground open for fintechs over the last few years. Just talk to us, to the extent you can, how these investments -- clearly the market\u2019s focused on near-term expenses, ROTCE pressures. But talk to us two years or three years fast forward, how do you feel about JPM as a franchise competing with bigtech, fintech head-to-head? Jamie Dimon : Great. But it\u2019s battle and gate. I mean, some of these people do a very good job. I think there are some things we, your bank should have done, so we should be a little self-critical. But we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we\u2019re not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That\u2019s just not even on the card. And we have assets and strengths. Look, the competition is very bright. I mean, they\u2019re bobbing and weaving. They\u2019re not changing, and they\u2019re not static. And I think sometimes few act like they\u2019re static and they\u2019re not static. But if we do a good job, like today, on consumer, I\u2019m sure some you Chase customers, free trading, a lot of ATMs, you\u2019ve got better and better services, more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more -- and you got more of that coming. And we\u2019ve gotten friendlier an overdraft. We\u2019ve gotten -- that\u2019s just one business. That\u2019s true for every single business. So, I look at middle way around JPMorgan, that\u2019s going be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase UK. We\u2019ve been very, very clear that costs us money, and a lot of you want to pay back tomorrow and stuff like that, we\u2019re not going to disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We\u2019re going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives, okay? So, I doubt, over the long run, we\u2019ll fail. We may not do -- we may not become the best digital bank in the UK or somewhere in the short run. Operator : Next, we have Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Jamie, I hear that you\u2019re ready to do an LBO on JPMorgan that you\u2019re so confident. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I think you\u2019d help me raise the equity capital. Mike Mayo : Well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out here with -- it\u2019s a little frustrating this call because the guidance you\u2019ve given has given all the bad news without any targets. I mean, you\u2019re saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE, despite the booming economy. You\u2019re guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage. I get it. That\u2019s not how you run the company. But $15 billion of investments, that\u2019s up one-half over last three years. And that $15 billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest U.S. bank. So, you gave us that, but you didn\u2019t tell us what to expect from all those investments in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting, what specific revenues do you expect, when do you expect that? Can you put some more meat on the bone here because this is -- at $5 billion of investment spend, look, it worked. You gained share. At $10 billion of investment spend, it worked. You gained share. But now you\u2019re going to $15 billion. It might not always work so well. So, can you, again, put more meat on the bones? The stock is down 5%. The feedback so far is like you\u2019re spending the rate hikes for investments over the next 10 years. That\u2019s great. You\u2019re in there for the long term, but a lot of the investors aren\u2019t planning to invest for a 10-year horizon. Jamie Dimon : Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we\u2019ll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets. It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- but the 400 branches that we\u2019re building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we\u2019re adding in private banking, and Chase Wealth Management, we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019ll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years. And so yes, we can\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there\u2019s a little bit of bubble expense in that. There\u2019s even a little bit of bubble expense on new headquarters. And so, we\u2019re pretty comfortable we\u2019re doing the right things. And we\u2019re being a little conservative. Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return, I told our folks that we\u2019re going to -- our card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We\u2019re not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it\u2019s not good enough yet. But it\u2019s got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We\u2019re pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true. Mike Mayo : I\u2019ll follow up and then I\u2019ll requeue after my follow-up. But as it relates to technology specifically, Jeremy, you talked about retiring technical debt. And so, that\u2019s kind of playing defense, but also on the offensive side, where are you investing for tech where you would expect some more revenues? You talked about digital banking in the UK? Are you also going to Brazil? What other countries are you targeting for that? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean -- it\u2019s funny. I wouldn\u2019t actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense. I mean, I think that\u2019s actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation, which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if you\u2019re playing defense focused on short-term targets. But if you\u2019re playing offense for the long term, it\u2019s exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you\u2019re articulating that\u2019s critical for the long-term success of the country -- the Company. So that\u2019s\u2026 Jamie Dimon : So, we spent $2 billion on brand-new data centers, okay, which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that. We\u2019re still running the old data centers. Now, we\u2019re not going to get involved in every time you talk, I\u2019ll explain every part of the pain cake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out. But all this stuff going to these new data centers, which is now completely up and running are -- well, some are, but most of the applications that go in have to be cloud eligible. Most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible. We\u2019re running a whole bunch of major programs, which I don\u2019t think we disclosed on AWS. And we\u2019re working with Google and Microsoft to run some of the stuff into cloud, so we want to have multiple cloud capabilities. And this year, roughly 30%, 40%, 50% of all our apps and all data will be moving to cloud-related type of stuff. This stuff is absolutely totally valuable. I mean, I can\u2019t -- if you sat in this room and look at the power of the cloud and big data on risk, fraud, marketing, capabilities, offers, customer satisfaction, dealing with errors and complaints, prospecting, it\u2019s extraordinary. You actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff. Like, for example, with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware, our fraud calls are down this year. There\u2019s a reason for that. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve deployed huge capabilities in those things. So, we have to do those things. And that\u2019s a margin that will be hugely valuable for us. And you\u2019ll see some of that benefit, which is why we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019ll continue to grow and expand and earn. Like I said, with 17% return on tangible capital, I would take that. If I could push a button and give you that the next 20 years, I would take it. And also, if I did it for the next 20 years, that number would probably be like a big part of the GDP of the United States of America. Mike Mayo : Okay. I\u2019ll requeue for my follow-up. Jamie Dimon : Mike asked another very good question market shares. We expect to go up in retail deposit market share, investment market share, private banking market share, fixed income market share, equity market share, investment banking market share, global market share, payments market share and security services market share, commercial banking market share, and what did I miss? I\u2019d be surprised if any of them go down. And we\u2019re not going to give you the number. Operator : As per now, we have one last question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, I\u2019m trying to figure out what the discussion topic is going to be first quarter of 2023 when we talk about fourth quarter numbers. And I think it might have more to do with credit than we\u2019re hearing about on the call today. Can you share with us the underwriting standards that you guys are using compared to what they were at the height of the crisis back in 2020? I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re easier today because the economy is stronger. But also, can you compare them to 2019? How does it look today versus what you guys were doing in 2019? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So I think broadly for the company, there\u2019s no really large change in our credit risk appetite, and therefore, in our underwriting standards. I think I alluded a little bit to this earlier, which is there\u2019s a subtlety in the card business, where if you remember, pre-pandemic, we had talked about card charge-off rates being at 3.25% and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages, still well within our credit box, still within our overall credit risk appetite, but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there. So, that happened back then, and we just didn\u2019t see it flow through because of obviously the extraordinary dynamics that we\u2019ve experienced with pandemic. And now, we\u2019re exiting the fourth quarter of this year with a card net charge-off rate. And I forget the exact number, something like 1.2% or something, so. Jamie Dimon : So, we can never see\u2026 Jeremy Barnum : Obviously exceptionally well. So, the question then becomes like -- and then I think somewhere in your question there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening, how did we modify the credit box and standards. And the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the pre-pandemic level. So we were obviously very confident in light of what we were seeing about what credit conditions were. Jamie Dimon : It got tied a little bit, and now it\u2019s back to where it was... Jeremy Barnum : Exactly. Jamie Dimon : None of that was completely material to the results. But one of the things in Jeremy\u2019s slide that you point, we\u2019ve been over earning on credit for years. And we expect that eventually to normalize. You could argue how fast and what time, but credit card has been a number that you\u2019ve never seen in our lives. Middle market has been lower than ever. Other sales have been lower than ever. Mortgages have been lower than ever cards. They\u2019re all low. Eventually, they\u2019re going to normalize. And then we kind of build that out. And the other thing is the loan book, and this is very important for your own modeling. Just assume as the loan book grows, we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth in the loan book, all things being equal. We\u2019ve got CECL and all this stuff like that. So, there\u2019s -- that\u2019s a flip to the negative, obviously, for next year, one item. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And so, Gerard, to your point about the fourth quarter of next year, right? I mean, one lens to look at that through is what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net charge-offs is through the course of 2022. And I don\u2019t want to get into too much specific guidance there, but the numbers that we\u2019re putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low-3s around the end of 2022 or early \u201823 in terms of card net charge-offs. So yes, on the one hand, maybe we\u2019ll be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up, but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And just as a quick follow-up, Jamie, and Jeremy, you talked about the balance sheet, the way it is today and all that liquidity. And I think, Jamie, you said $500 billion could be put to use. How long will you guys -- will it take you to get to a balance sheet and a mix of business that looks like you would have thought back in 2019 before this whole pandemic started and the balance sheet did what it did? Jamie Dimon : I think, we\u2019re in a -- again, some of those things are outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff. But the real fact is we got Basel IV, a lot of changes. And when all that happens, we\u2019ll give you a little bit better update how we\u2019re going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that. But we\u2019re in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet. We\u2019ll be very patient. Operator : Mike Mayo had another question. Mike Mayo : Just more detail on the tech spend. And what I asked before was on digital banking, you\u2019re going to the UK. What other countries are you going to? Again, just looking for some more specifics, at least on digital banking and other tech areas where you expect revenue pickup, not just -- you mentioned fraud and AML and ransomware and cyber, and that\u2019s all -- that\u2019s table stakes, as you would say. But as far as actually getting revenue growth from your tech investments, and starting off with digital banking, which new markets are you entering? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, on digital banking, we\u2019re not going to disclose specific countries that we\u2019re going into, one. Jamie Dimon : There isn\u2019t one we\u2019re talking about for next year. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean I think just to validate Mike\u2019s question, as you know, we have made this investment in C6 in Brazil. So Brazil, it\u2019s not exactly the same. It\u2019s not a de novo build by us, but we\u2019re there. We\u2019re engaged. It\u2019s a significant investment. And Brazil is like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective and the digital play there is quite interesting. So, that\u2019s one example. And obviously, we\u2019re thinking about additional places to go, and we\u2019ll let you know when we do it. Mike Mayo : Okay. And the other tech investments where you could expect additional revenues, what would that include? I mean, for example, with your marketing and the degree you\u2019re using AI and big data for what kind of improved take rates do you have or just again, looking for more specifics where you can provide it? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories. I mean, there\u2019s cool stuff, like we\u2019re doing some AI-enabled lead optimization stuff in AWM, for example. So I could come up with a list of like 20 things like that. But in reality, it\u2019s really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff. Examples where it\u2019s like I spent $10 million on X that\u2019s technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring, as Jamie says, and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that. I\u2019m sure we have some of those examples somewhere. I don\u2019t have them with me. Maybe we can talk about them next quarter. But I generally think that that sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture. Mike Mayo : Okay. Last one. On the -- what is your total tech spend, again? I thought I saw in the deck. How much of that is to run the bank versus change the bank? And then as it relates to the cloud specifically, what do you expect -- that\u2019s a bold move to move Chase, the core bank to the cloud. What do you expect that to save once that gets done? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, a couple of things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it\u2019s like $12-ish billion, a bit more, 50-50, run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So, it gives you a little bit of a... Jamie Dimon : Hey, Mike. I\u2019m going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think, these numbers are accurate -- we did this a while ago. Card runs a mainframe -- which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, et cetera, it\u2019s been updated for years, but it\u2019s a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn\u2019t the reason we\u2019re doing it. The reason we\u2019re doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the database is that it uses to feed, its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to enormous machine learning. So that you can -- when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you -- we know what you like to eat, steakhouse, you eat here, immediately offers and fraud stuff is 10 times what it is today. And so that\u2019s the real value. The value isn\u2019t the immediate cost save that you\u2019ve gone from -- you\u2019re saving $30 million running this application. I want the $30 million. And the other thing that allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system. You touch a mainframe system, you\u2019ve got to be a little careful when you go into it, make some modifications. So, like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system 4 times a year, big releases and stuff like that, of course, multiple -- for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to do this. And it also makes is hard to quantify the benefits and the cost. Jeremy Barnum : But Mike, just a big one example, I guess, from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa\u2019s Securities Services business, it\u2019s an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So, in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially on services administration tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so, that was typically the dynamic there. And I think a lot of the investment that we\u2019re making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business, it\u2019s a little bit more accretive. So, that\u2019s kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it\u2019s more profitable, for example. At the same time, we\u2019re also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that, which maybe will help us win more mandates. Jamie Dimon : I know we got to end this call because we\u2019ve got some of the stuff we got to do. Just for example, is an important one, and Teresa, there\u2019s all the credit for this. We now are using JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking derivative capability to help clients use derivatives for custody to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can\u2019t do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they\u2019re using more and more what you and I call derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That costs time. It costs money. It\u2019s on the cloud. It\u2019s hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage. Folks, thank you very much for taking some time with us. Good luck to everybody. Operator : That marks the end of your call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%. These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well as $500 million of losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB. Regarding loan growth. We're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter ex PPP with the sequential growth driven by a continued pickup in demand in our Wholesale businesses, including ongoing strength in AWM. On Page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2 billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower Home Lending production revenue, losses in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB as well as investment securities losses in corporate. And Markets revenue was down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine as well as builds for Russia-associated exposures in CIB and AWM. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down year-on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA-CCR adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of other drivers. The rate sell-off led to AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. But keep in mind, all else equal, these mark-to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature. And price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead. With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion, which was down 2% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by flows in addition to market performance. In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year-on-year on lower production revenue from both, lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the rise in rates. And as a result, mortgage loans were down 3%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 8% year-on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations, leading to higher acquisition costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quarter of '21 levels. And in Auto, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%. Touching on consumer spend. Combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year-on-year with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year-on-year. We maintained our number one rank with a wallet share of 8%. In Advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2021. Debt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leverage finance as issuers contended with market volatility. And in equity underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market. Equity markets were down 7% against an all-time record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best with robust client activity across both, derivatives and cash. And prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around all-time highs. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both, increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter. We were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who generally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty related, not trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Other line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported VaR, which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings. Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year-on-year or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments, driven by continued growth in fees, deposit balances and higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 3% year-on-year, mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4 billion was flat year-on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances, offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both, fewer large deals and less flow activity. Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year-end. Loans were up 5% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter, excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a pretax margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees and alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $19 billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities, multi-asset and alternatives. And in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion. AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year-on-year, respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And finally, loans were up 3% quarter-on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities-based lending, while deposits were up 9%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Revenue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year-on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately $400 million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184 million were lower by $692 million year-on-year primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year. Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect NII ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77 billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month. So to wrap up, once again, this quarter, the Company's performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment. We helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments around the world. And of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our employees affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Please standby. And our first question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. I was wondering about the net interest income outlook. I know it sounds like we'll get more at Investor Day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February. And obviously, rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color on what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Good morning, John, good question. And yes, look, obviously, given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting questioned into the front of the curve, we would actually expect the access part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at Credit Suisse. So, to size that, probably a couple of million dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. We -- there have been very big moves, and we want to get it right. And so, we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day. John McDonald : Okay. And as my follow-up, could you give us some thoughts about the Markets-related NII? What things should we think about there, whether it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I guess, I would direct you to my comments, I think, one or two quarters ago on this. But generally speaking, that number is pretty correlated to the short-term rate. So, all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through, which, in general, in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues, as I've mentioned in the past. And so, that's why we don't focus too much on that number. Operator : The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Jeremy, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic growth. With a 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer-term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first quarter? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, thanks. So, let me just give some high-level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So, as you know, we went into the quarter with elevated buffers, knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA-CCR. And so, of course, that happened. And we would have expected roughly to be 12.5 right in the middle of the range this quarter. Of course, it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways. And so, we saw RWA inflation from market risk, which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%. From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are, in fact, going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So, we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obviously come back over time. And probably most importantly, to the prior question, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook, which will, of course, accrete to capital. So then, if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the G-SIB requirement in the first quarter of '23 coming in. And then, there's a question of SCB, where we don't know, obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and that the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed scenario, you might expect SCB to be a little bit higher when it's published in June, effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make. So, I guess, to summarize, when we put all this together, between improved income generation, some of the denominator to KFX and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as soon information comes into play, we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve. Ken Usdin : And just a follow-up there, too. Is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to help bridge the gap, or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with possibly just utilizing less buyback to allow things to just grow back? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I think, the -- I guess, in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments are callable. And we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations. So I think that's an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be. Operator : The next one is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you mentioned how you expect to achieve double-digit market share over time in payments. And what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves. For example, in consumer credit card, you're at 20%, 25%. In treasury, I think you're at 7%. So, could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to double-digit and what kind of time frame you're thinking about there? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So yes, Betsy, so that number, the double-digit relating just to Wholesale Payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously, we already have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit north of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building out. And I gave some examples and I\u2019d give a lot and then you have Investor Day coming up, we're building all the things we need, real-time payments, certain blockchain-type things. While it's a couple of acquisitions, they're building out our Wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what I'd say very good cyber and risk controls, which clients really need too, by the way. So, it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it, but it's an area we want to win in. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And getting to double digits is over the same kind of time frame with the same pace going from 4% to 7%, or do you think you can accelerate that? Because I see what... Jamie Dimon : I wasn't meaning to put a time frame on it, but I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just a follow-up here is on the NII outlook, where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side and is it a couple of billion. And I guess the question I have is historically, you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well. What I hear -- what I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at Investor Day. Is that a fair takeaway? Jamie Dimon : No, no, no. We don't look at that way like we're reinvesting NII. We -- the investing stuff, we look at all the time we're investing, and we're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why you're saying... Jeremy Barnum : I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time, some short-term headwinds to that, mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with a question on QT. In the past, you've spoken about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves in the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path per balance sheet reduction, how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk? Any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle, given a more aggressive pace of Fed timing? Jeremy Barnum : Hey Steve, so this is a fun question. So, let's nerd out a little bit. I'm sure Jamie will jump in. So look, I think we've talked a little bit about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So, you had QE, and then you had big expansion in bank deposits, system-wide expansion. And at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in, and then RRP has gotten sort of quite big as QE finished. And so now, as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink. But I think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize that there's a lot of interacting forces here and is really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen here. And just to outline a couple of those. So, it's worth noting for starters that in general, industry-wide loan growth outlook is quite robust, and that should be a tailwind for system-wide deposit growth. So, as you noted, yes, QT will start in May in all likelihood for the minutes headwind. Then, you just have to look at what's going to happen in the front end of the curve, particularly in bills. So, the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage of short-dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so, those things are going to interact in various ways. I think, one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value non-operating-type deposits. So, in any case, we'll see. But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth in deposits for us as a company. And just pivoting away for a second from the system to us, from a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in Wholesale, we've had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So, that's the current thinking on that topic. Jamie Dimon : So, the answer is we don't know. Okay? And you guys read economies [ph] reports, but the fact is initially probably won't come out of deposits. Over time, it will come out of Wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be that different than was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and minuses. You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis-point increase. Steve Chubak : Just one more topic or a follow-up, I should say. Jamie, just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation. And what's your expectation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just help us understand given your own rate outlook, how that's informing how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher-yielding securities? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. And look, no one knows. And obviously, everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that. Okay? I give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and just about deposits. And we've never been through ever QT like this. So, this is a new thing for the world and I think is more substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change their investment portfolio. So, we're going to be fine because we're going to certainly help our customers and gain share. So, what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase, we'll be fine. We got plenty of capital, all great margins. We already have the returns we want and all things like that. So, I just -- I would just be cautious. I think what you should expect is volatile markets. Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed -- we think the Fed needs to do, they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing, if possible. Steve Chubak : And any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity? Jamie Dimon : No, don't expect that. Operator : The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions, just because what I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of an adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to a big... Jeremy Barnum : It really is that... Jamie Dimon : And we don't know, and it's a guess. It's probability weighted, hypothetical, multiyear scenarios that -- we do the best we can, but to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of time. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business. Charge-offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market, 1 basis point, credit card 1.5. We would have told you in the past that the best it'll ever be is 2.5. So, credit is very good. That will get worse. NII is going to get much better. Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have -- yes. Glenn Schorr : The 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So, I appreciate that. Jamie Dimon : I don't -- Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is. Glenn Schorr : Okay. So, I think you might have just answered it, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follow-up I have on credit, and I know it's in much better shape, and it depends on the go forward. But are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets, meaning leveraged loan, high-yield, CLO, private credit, anything in there that makes you like turn a side eye? Jamie Dimon : Just spread widening, a little bit less liquidity. Glenn Schorr : That doesn't sound so bad. And... Jeremy Barnum : I mean, I think, look, we -- no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak. Glenn Schorr : Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there any buckets of income that you're seeing early stage delinquencies picking up? Jeremy Barnum : In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in card and you sort of -- that heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so, we're watching that, especially in the kind of LMI segment of our customer base. But right now, we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry. Operator : The next one is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that you guys built up and was due to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is it because you're concerned about the lower-end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that might lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And how much was it due to the Ukraine situation? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Glenn (sic) [Gerard], it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 name specific, primarily related to Russia-associated individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a -- you might call it, Volcker-style, Fed-induced recession in response to the current inflationary environment, which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases, which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro portfolio level thing, except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top-down modification of the probabilistic ways. Jamie Dimon : One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it. Gerard Cassidy : Understood. And then, as a follow-up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it's going to accrete back into the capital as those securities mature. Two things. Is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward, is there anything you can do to mitigate that, whether to shrink that -- the available-for-sale portfolio, which looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period, or do you just have to grow the revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think that, obviously, we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes, there are some things that can be done to mitigate this. But the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out as along the lines of the central case, we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so. Operator : The next one is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have a question for both, Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But since quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse. And I'm guessing your SLR might be very even close to that minimum. So, I understand your central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good. But at what point do you say you stop buybacks, or do you think you'll buy back maybe half of the $30 billion authorization, or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps, given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months? So, that's my question for Jeremy. But the bigger picture is for you, Jamie, your CEO letter. The takeaway was in the eye of the beholder, like Jamie is really worried about a recession this year. Now he's not. So, the first question certainly ties into the second. So Jeremy, plan for buybacks, stopping at asset cap? And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Okay, Mike. So, let me take this capital one. So first, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a distraction, and the terminology is unhelpful. Then, in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So, 5.20 is actually still pretty far away from 5%. And of course, there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier. In addition, I do think it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, you're subject to a 60% restriction, which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So, it's obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there. And then, in terms of buybacks, just a reminder that the $30 billion authorization is a nontime-bounded SEC requirement. It's not the old CCAR standard. So, it's just a signal that we want to have that capacity and that flexibility. But it doesn't really say that much about how much we're actually planning to do in the near term. Mike Mayo : Are you allowed to say what you're planning to do in the near term? Like just -- like if you're kind of like half the level last year, do you think you can keep that, or does this slow down, or you're not giving guidance? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Let's talk about buybacks for a second. So in the kind of post-SCB world, we haven't been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks, mainly because, as you know, they're at the bottom of our capital stack. So, we're focused on investing in the business, providing capital to support growing RWA, acquisitions when they make sense, et cetera, et cetera. And buybacks are -- an output. As we've discussed, in the current environment, the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the 2021 period as a result of the interaction of all those effects. And that's a good thing. It means that we have better uses for the capital. And if things evolve one way or the other, then the rate of buybacks will be an output, but it's one of the tools in the toolkit. Jamie Dimon : Mike, I would just add, if you look at liquidity and capital, it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So, we're going to manage this pretty tightly over time. And obviously, when you have AOCI and earnings and CECL, all that, but being conscious of all of that, we can manage through that. And we've done some acquisitions this year. And so, -- and plus, we are adding -- we're planning to have more capital for the increase in G-SIFI down the road, which reduced stock buyback and -- but the amount -- I look at the amount of liquidity, the earnings, the capital, that's the stuff that really matters. And at the end of the day, it's driving customers. We serve customers, which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an output of stuff we do. And so -- and then your question about -- I think it was about recession basically. Yes, do you want to repeat the question? Mike Mayo : Yes. No, I mean, if you read your CEO letter, and that's great. You're the Chief Worry Officer. You're the Chief Risk Manager. You're bringing up all the things that keep you up at night, which is great. But you can read it one way and say, hey, Jamie and JPMorgan thinks there's going to be a recession this year. And you can read it in other way, saying, hey, things are fine, but these are some tail risks. So, do you think -- and I'll repeat what Glenn said. Your view is better than mine, and I'm not going to accept anything else. You have a lot of people, a lot of resources. Do you think the U.S. is going to have a recession this year based on everything you know? Jamie Dimon : Yes, I don't. But I just want to question this. First of all, I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And the Fed forecasted and everyone forecasted, and everyone's wrong all the time, and I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve clients through thick or thin. That's what we do. We know there will be ups. We know there will be down. We know the weather is going to change and all that stuff like that. What I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth, right now, which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money. They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high, but the fact that they have money, they're spending their money. They have $2 trillion still in their savings and checking accounts, business are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So you have this -- that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter, third quarter. And I -- after that, it's hard to predict. You've got two other very large countervailing factors, which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QE/QT. You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that we've -- those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not. That's a fact. And I'm quite conscious of that fact, and I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that. And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that war in Ukraine. Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I don't -- I'm not looking at this on a static basis. Okay? So you're looking at this war in Ukraine and sanctions. Things are unpredictable. Wars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcome. You've already seen in oil markets. The oil markets are precarious. Okay? So I pointed that out over and over that people don't understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons, cyber reasons or just supply-demand. And so, that's another huge cloud in the horizon, and I -- we're prepared for it. We understand it. We're just -- I can't tell you the outcome of it. I hope those things all disappear and go away. We have a soft landing, and the Board is resolved. Okay? I just wouldn't bet on all that. I just -- and of course, being a risk manager, we're going to get through all that. We're going to serve our clients, and we're going to gain share. We're going to come to that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past. Operator : Next one is from Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Connor: I was hoping you guys could comment on the -- there are some articles on the nickel exposure and how the losses could have been significant if the trades hadn't been canceled and from the actions that were taken. And then, just as a follow-up. You guys have talked about kind of looking at that business and reevaluating how you think about some of the outsized risks, and maybe you can update us on that process. Jamie Dimon : We've already told you, we're helping our clients get through this. We had a little bit lost this quarter but we manage through it. We\u2019ll do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later. We're not going to do it now. Matthew O\u2019Connor: And then, I guess, I mean, more broadly speaking, given what we just saw where it was probably a several standard deviation event and kind of, as you mentioned, markets might do more of these unusual things. Like, does it make you step back and look at other portfolios, other businesses and try to... Jamie Dimon : In my life, I've seen so many 10 standard deviation events [indiscernible]. Obviously, we're aware of that all the time in everything we do. Jeremy Barnum : And I would take it one step further. I think the whole paradigm of saying it's a 10 standard deviation event is na\u00efve, right? We know the returns are not normally distributed. We know that. Regulators know that. The capital framework recognizes that in a broad variety of ways, including things like stress. So I don't think -- of course, you can't predict where and in which asset class and in which particular moment you're going to see these types of fat tail events. But the framework recognizes in a range of ways that that's the case. And that's how we manage risk, and that's how we're... Jamie Dimon : So, we do CCAR once a year, as you guys see. But we actually run 100 different various stress tests every week with extreme movements and things. And that's what we do. And we're always -- you're always going to be a little surprise somewhere, but we're pretty conscious of those risks. And all events like this, we always look at -- but it doesn't have to happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that maybe we were on the wrong side of something, too. But at the end of the day, in all of our businesses, we are here to serve clients all the time. That means taking rational, thoughtful, disciplined risk to do that. Matthew O\u2019Connor: And then, just separately, you had mentioned earlier that you weren't looking to deploy large amounts of your liquidity. And I guess, the question is, you might get the rate benefit just from Fed funds going up, but is there an opportunity to accelerate that benefit just by moving some cash into shorter-term treasuries? We've also seen a big move in... Jamie Dimon : Guys, we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%. Convexity is going up. AOCI is going up, all these -- there are all these various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And Steve (sic) [Matthew], just to -- just go one level deeper there for a second, right? So you talk about deployment. Of course, as Jamie says, we're always going to take relative value opportunities in the portfolio. Mortgage spreads have widened, there's interesting stuff to do. So in that sense, yes, deployment out of cash into various sorts of spread product that looks more interesting, we do that all the time. The high-level simple question of buying duration as Jamie says, balance sheets extended a little bit. That was never -- we were never planning to do that much of that anyway. And frankly, given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes, increasingly, it just kind of doesn't matter that much. And yes, so I think it's helpful to keep that in mind. Operator : The next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about the trajectory of loan growth from here, where you're seeing the biggest pockets of strength? And specifically in cards, is the significant year-over-year growth driven more by slowing paydowns, or is that increasing demand or a combination of both? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, you'll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high single-digit loan growth for the year. And this quarter, we've roughly seen that. Interestingly, it's a little bit more driven by Wholesale this quarter, which sort of brings us to your question of card. So overall card loan growth is reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on. And that's really primarily driven by spend, which, as you know, is very robust. The question inside of that is then what's going on with revolve. And I think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the pre-pandemic levels of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a good approximation. At the margin, we probably saw the like takeoff moment delayed by 6 weeks or so because of Omicron. But some of that's reaccelerating now. We see that in some of the March numbers. So, we'll see how it goes. But also just a reminder that there's a very, very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in charge-offs. And so, in the moments where revolve is lagging potentially, certainly that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we thought. We also saw exceptionally low charge-offs. So, on a bottom line basis, the run rate performance, there's significant offset there. But the core thesis is still there. Spend is robust. We are seeing spend down some of the cash buffers in the customer segment that tends to revolve. So, more or less as anticipated, I would say. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then, maybe just on -- skipping over to trading. Clearly, a stronger quarter, must have finished off strongly in March. So, any confirmation of that? And how do we -- if you're expecting more volatility around Fed in QT, is it -- should we be thinking that this could be a better than normalization year? How are you thinking about trading, I guess, going forward? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, you know that we're going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance. Jim Mitchell : I could try. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, obviously, yes. But just to your point about normalization, right? We've been saying that, of course, we expect some normalization. The question is, if you define normalization as a return to kind of like 2019-type trading run rate levels, we never expected that because there's been a bunch of organic growth in the background, some share gains. And we had said that as we emerge from the pandemic and monetary policy normalized, that was going to add volatility to the markets and that with any luck and good risk management, that would net-net help a little bit mitigate what we might otherwise expect in terms of the drop from the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic. So, obviously, there are some particular things that played out this quarter, but one of those was more volatile rate market, and that helps a little bit. So yes, all else equal, the much more dynamic environment right now would mute the normalization you would see otherwise. But our core case is still that the pandemic year period market's performance was -- is not repeatable. Jamie Dimon : And I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward. We've already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy, QT, inflation, war, commodity prices, there's almost no chance that you want to have volatile markets. That could be good or bad for trading, but some [indiscernible] change won't happen. And I think people should be prepared for that. Operator : The next one is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just one more question on the macro outlook. I guess we can debate whether or not we get into a recession over the next year. But Jamie, would love to hear your thoughts around as we think about just the medium term, do you see a better CapEx cycle for the U.S. economy? We've heard a lot about reshoring, labor productivity, how companies are dealing with it. Just given the lens you have in terms of large corporate middle market customers, do you see some pent-up demand for CapEx spending that's going to be a big driver of growth, maybe not for the next six months, but as we think about the medium term, next few years? Jamie Dimon : Yes, in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that, yes, and generally see CapEx going up. And I forgot the exact number. You better off looking at our great accounting forecast -- than asking me. And we see in the borrowing a little bit\u2026 Jeremy Barnum : Yes, we do see pretty nice loan growth in the commercial bank. I mean, there's a bunch of different factors there, could be some inventory effects and so on, but we'll see. But yes. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just on that front, like have you seen any improvement in supply chains? And how big a setback was the Russia war to supply chain improvements? Jamie Dimon : It's very hard to tell. There was some improvement and then there was Ukraine. And now, it's all mixed again. So, it's hard to tell. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one follow-up around you launched the UK digital bank last month. Any early wins in terms of how that's playing out? Any perspective on what the markets are as we think about how that strategy plays out? I'm sure you're going to talk about that at Investor Day, but just wondering any early thoughts. Jamie Dimon : We'll leave that to Investor Day. Operator : And the next question is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. My questions have been asked and answered. I'll see you guys at Investor Day. Jeremy Barnum : All right. Thanks, Erika. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. Jamie Dimon : Well, thank you very much. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks very much. Jamie Dimon : See you, I guess, at Investor Day. Jeremy Barnum : May 23rd. Jamie Dimon : Okay. Goodbye. Operator : Thank you so much, everyone. That marks the end of our conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining, and you can enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%. Touching on a few highlights. We had another quarter of strong performance in Markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is still quite healthy, and net charge-offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, with average loans up 7% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $2.8 billion or 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex Markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and higher card acquisition costs, and Markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year-on-year. Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge-offs of $657 million and reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let\u2019s start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters. The new 4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter, and the 4% G-SIB effective in 1Q \u201823 further raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB to be higher and made it clear that in the near term, share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than expected, we have paused buybacks for the near term. As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any access over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities. We have a long established track record of balance sheet discipline across the Company, and this quarter\u2019s RWA reduction shows evidence of this discipline. Turning to this quarter\u2019s results, you can see that our CET1 ratio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk RWA from the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio. Now let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB\u2019s performance, let me touch on what we\u2019re seeing in our data regarding the health of the U.S. consumer. Spend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up 15% year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments. Notably, the average consumer is spending 35% more year-on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories. At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending, including in the lower income segments, with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year-on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started, though cash buffers still remain elevated. With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion, which was down 1% year-on-year. In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits. Deposits were up 13% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. And client investment assets were down 7% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows. Home Lending revenue was down 26% year-on-year as the rate environment drove both, lower production revenue and tighter spreads, partially offset by higher net servicing revenue. And mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income, largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion, down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates, while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year-on-year driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume and revenue-related expenses. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, down $121 million year-on-year, driven by card and a reserve build of $150 million in card driven by loan growth. Next to CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million with about $345 million reflected in payments, and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 61% year-on-year or down 53%, excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were down 54% versus an all-time record quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In advisory, fees were down 28%, reflecting a decline in announced activity, which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses. Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 million was up 79% versus the prior year, driven by gains on mark-to-market hedges as well as higher loan balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year-on-year in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year. In fixed income, elevated volatility drove both, increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise, most notably in currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by Credit and Securitized Products in a challenging spread environment. In Equity Markets, we had a strong second quarter, and again, increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $218 million, largely driven by funding spread widening. Payments revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year or up 25%, excluding the markdowns on equity investments. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion were up 3% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. The Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $788 million was down 32%, driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 18% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenue-related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, driven by migration of non-operating deposits into higher-yielding alternatives, which we expect to continue given the current rate environment. Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6%, reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across Middle Market and Corporate Client Banking. CRE loans were up 3%, driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, Credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth, while net charge-offs remain historically low. And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins, partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management as well as higher volume and revenue-related expenses. For the quarter, net long-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion, down 8% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, were predominantly driven by lower market levels, partially offset by net long-term inflows. And finally, loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 7% sequentially, driven by seasonal client tax payments. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII was $324 million, up $1.3 billion, predominantly due to the impact of higher rates. And expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. You will recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex Markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now expect it to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year-end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately $77 billion and the Card net charge-off rate to be less than 2% for 2022. So to wrap up, the Company\u2019s performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well positioned for a broad range of outcomes. With that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Please stand by. And the first question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : Hey. Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. I wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve provided an update on your firm-wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13%. And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your G-SIB surcharge to 4.5%, your regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital target for you to manage to from here over the long term? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you\u2019re right in the sense that we didn\u2019t talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two G-SIB bucket increases coming, one in the first quarter of \u201823 and the other one in the first quarter of \u201824. So, we had worked all that out on Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected. So, for now, we\u2019re really focused on 1Q \u201823. Of course, all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5% to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher. But there is another round of SCB, and that\u2019s a long way away. And as you know, and as you can see, there\u2019s a lot of organic capital generation. So, we\u2019ll kind of cross that bridge when we come to it. Jamie Dimon : We intend to drive that SCB down by reducing the things that created it. Steve Chubak : Fair enough. And just for my follow-up on the loan growth outlook. Loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy, that you conveyed was quite constructive, despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companies just citing higher inventory levels, declining personal savings rates, growing inflationary pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here, I was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different businesses? And what do you see as a sustainable run rate of loan growth over the medium term? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, we\u2019ve talked, as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid -- high single digits loan growth expectation for this year. And that outlook is more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination. We\u2019re also seeing good growth in CRE. And of course, we continue to see very robust card loan growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I\u2019m not going to give now. And obviously, as you know, it\u2019s going to be very much a function of the economic environment, so. Jamie Dimon : Yes. The only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio-based, think of mortgages, and there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re going to drive it down substantially. Operator : The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all. Meaning JPMorgan is always growth-minded. You underwrite for returns over the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you\u2019ve noted in some of the articles you\u2019ve been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightened the underwriting box to build capital and liquidity faster, or do you think you can get there just through what you\u2019ve laid out today on the buyback pause? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. No. So, I mean, look, I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So, first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time, if not early. At the same time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we\u2019re going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elements or lending, which are either low returning or have a low client nexus or both. We do that all the time anyway. But of course, in this moment, we\u2019re going to turn up the heat on that a little bit. In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box. And I don\u2019t think we expect any particular change there. Jamie Dimon : And the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So, if you look at our bridge book, it\u2019s smaller than it was because we price our self out of the market. And that was a good thing because a lot of people can lose a lot of money there, and we lost a little. And so, we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the poor scenario in this quarter? And just curious on how you thought about that. Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Yes, but we didn\u2019t do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So, we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what\u2019s implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably, we were sort of early on that. So, it really wasn\u2019t necessary this quarter. Operator : The next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Jeremy, I was wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you\u2019re seeing, the differences between commercial deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, great question, John. And I think you\u2019re right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there. So, on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition, and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the commercial bank for non-operating deposits, knowing fully that our pricing strategy, as rates went up, was going to be to not pay up. And therefore, we expected the attrition from those -- from that client base. And so, we\u2019re seeing that, and that\u2019s actually something that we want, all else equal. And it\u2019s playing out in line with expectations. You do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in wealth management. I think that\u2019s just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual. And then, on the consumer side, we\u2019re really not seeing much at all. So, that remains strong, not seeing any attrition there. And it\u2019s early in the cycle to really be observing much, one way or the other from a pricing perspective. John McDonald : Okay. And then, as a follow-up, in terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate ex you have assumed in your outlook? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, the 66 number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like 68, 68 plus, something like that. Obviously, we\u2019re annualizing one quarter. So, there can always be noise in there, but that seems like a good number to us. That\u2019s consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question? Jamie Dimon : For \u201823. John McDonald : \u2026deposit -- yes. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, yes, yes. So, in terms of \u201823, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate. And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we\u2019re starting from a higher launch point, higher rates and less so after the CPI trend, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So, that could have some impact on the dynamic. Obviously, this is all in an environment very volatile implied, but the core view of some upside from that fourth quarter run rate into 2023 is still in place. Operator : The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Jamie, you mentioned just on the SCB earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise. Could you give us a sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that SCB up? Because I talked to folks that say it\u2019s a black box. So, it would be helpful to understand what you see as what the drivers were to that SCB increase. Jamie Dimon : First of all, it\u2019s public. So, you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit loss and stuff like that. And we don\u2019t agree with the stress test. It\u2019s inconsistent. It\u2019s not transparent. It\u2019s too volatile. It\u2019s basically capricious arbitrary. We do 100 a week. This is one. And I need to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points. So, we\u2019ll work on it. We haven\u2019t made definitive decisions. But I\u2019ve already mentioned about we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We\u2019re probably going to drive down mortgages, and we\u2019ll probably drive that other credit too that creates SCB. So, I could go into specifics on that. It\u2019s easy for us to do. You\u2019ve seen us do it before. We\u2019re going to drive out non-IP deposits. It creates no risk to us, but as the G-SIFI and all various things. And so, we\u2019re going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns, have great clients and not worry about it. We just want to get there right away. I don\u2019t want to sit there and dawdle. That\u2019s the rule. They gave it to us. We\u2019re going. Jeremy Barnum : Hey Betsy. Maybe I\u2019ll just jump in a little bit on the black box. Jamie Dimon : There\u2019s another very important point for shareholders. That number, when they -- that doesn\u2019t even remotely -- the stress loss doesn\u2019t even remotely represent what happened under that kind of scenario. And I\u2019m not saying the Fed says it should or shouldn\u2019t. But I would tell you, we\u2019d make money under that scenario. We wouldn\u2019t lose. I think they had us losing $44 billion. There\u2019s almost no chance that that would be true. And I just -- and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and say, well, what\u2019s going to happen? And there\u2019s good evidence. We didn\u2019t lose money after Lehmann. We didn\u2019t lose money in the great -- what just happened. We didn\u2019t lose money, great financial recession. The Company has got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, asset management, custody, payment services. And then, we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. Now, we\u2019ve got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit. But again, that\u2019s an accounting entry. And so, we feel in very good shape. We just have to hold a higher number now, and we\u2019re going to go there. Jeremy Barnum : And Betsy, maybe I\u2019ll just comment briefly on the black box point because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that across the industry. And it\u2019s -- you have to -- we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements, but there are pretty big changes that come into effect fairly quickly for banks, and I think that\u2019s probably not healthy. And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of information released, as Jamie says. But since the SCB is really a quantity that gets measured to the peak drawdown period, and that information does not get released, it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to understand what\u2019s actually driving it. And that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central criticism, I guess, I would say. But nonetheless, you got capital generation... Jamie Dimon : This got bad effects for the economy because -- I just said, we\u2019re going to drive down this and drive down. It\u2019s not good for the United States economy. And the mortgage business in particular is bad for lower income mortgages, which hurts lower income, minorities and stuff like that because we haven\u2019t fixed the mortgage business, and now we\u2019re making it worse. There\u2019s no real risk in it, not a benefit to JPMorgan, but it hurts this country, and it\u2019s very unfortunate. Betsy Graseck : I hear you on all that. And the mortgage comment you made earlier was about shrinking mortgage growth rates or shrinking the balances of mortgages that you have on the books? Jamie Dimon : The balance -- well, no, we\u2019ll originate but the balances in the books will probably come down. And look, we reserve the right to change that. But that\u2019s a portfolio decision. And if it doesn\u2019t make sense to own mortgages, we\u2019re not going to own them. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And would you reduce the buffer? I mean, in the past, Jamie, you\u2019ve talked about, hey, as these required capital ratios increase relative to the risk in your business, staying more consistent than you\u2019ve said before that you may operate with less of a buffer. Could you unpack that a little bit? Jamie Dimon : We\u2019re going to keep a buffer -- I\u2019m not even sure what the SCB means at this point. We\u2019re not going to go below any regulatory minimum. And if we have to, we\u2019ll just drive down credit more to where we got to create. It\u2019s a terrible way to run a financial system. And we owe you more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much -- what I think is so much excess capital. It just causes a huge confusion about what you should be doing with your capital. But keep in mind, one thing, we\u2019re earning 70% of tangible equity. We can continue doing that. The Company is in great shape. We\u2019re going to serve our clients and manage the hell out of the rest of the stuff. We still think we have great businesses and stuff like that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Most of this stuff doesn\u2019t create any additional risk at all. It just creates capital. Operator : The next question is coming from Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just on expenses. If I kind of look at the first half with the slowdown in investment banking, I think you\u2019re annualized less than $76 billion, but you\u2019re still targeting $77 billion. Is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half or just uncertainty around getting the pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Jim, good question. We\u2019ve looked at that, too. It\u2019s definitely more of the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense, including deal, M&A closing and adding to the run rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans, resulting in increased headcount, probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on. So, I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions about lower than $77 billion based on the first half numbers. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. And then, just maybe on credit. It continues to look, I guess, very good, whether it\u2019s on the consumer side or commercial side. We don\u2019t really see it, but are you starting to see any initial cracks in credit or strains in the system? Jeremy Barnum : Look, I think the short answer to that question is no, certainly not in any of our reported actual results for this quarter. The place that everyone... Jamie Dimon : Excellent. Jeremy Barnum : Right, exactly. Obviously, running still well below normal levels from the pre-pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the magnification of the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segments and early delinquency roll rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn down of excess cash is a little bit faster there, buffers are still above what they were pre pandemic, but coming down, and that absolute numbers for the typical customer are not that high. And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre-pandemic levels, but getting closer in the lower income segment. So, if you wanted to try to look for early warning signals, that\u2019s where you would see it. But I think there\u2019s really still a big question about whether that\u2019s simply normalization or whether it\u2019s actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really not very exposed to that segment of the market. So, not really very significant for us. Jim Mitchell : Right. So, prime is still holding up quite well? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Jamie Dimon : Even better. Operator : The next question is coming from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a follow-up on the point about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think about your ability to manage the RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might impact either the net income outcome or the ROTCE outcome as you look forward? Jamie Dimon : Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. I can think we do without affecting our ROTC targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it will affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit of stuff like that. But all told, we\u2019re going to imagine how it will be fine. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s a fair point. And then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the denominator increase in there, too and spend versus lend. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So on card revenue rate, we\u2019ve said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year, and it\u2019s running a little bit lower right now. And I think the current level -- but where is it, Michael, 9.6 or something is probably the right the right number for the full year at this point. And really, the difference is driven by a couple of factors. The main one is that while the growth in revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization and revolve balances happening towards early -- beginning of next year, that -- starting point of that did get slightly delayed by Omicron by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal\u2019s a little bit of NII headwind relative to what we\u2019d expected, but still obviously very robust\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Can I just add a little bit on -- because I know I\u2019m harping on mortgage a little here, but I just want to explain it. Because -- if you go to Europe, okay, the capital held against mortgage is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that and standardized risk-weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So, there are a lot of ways to manage it. And we don\u2019t have -- there\u2019s no securitization market today. So, our view would change if there was a securitization market, we might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, sign it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk of returns. And so, it\u2019s unfortunate, because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our clients. Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad with what they need, how they need it. And now we spend all the time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements. Jeremy Barnum : Right. So, yes, and just to finish on card. So, slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay. And that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there\u2019s some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well. Operator : The next question is coming from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Could you help me reconcile your words with your actions? After Investor Day, Jamie, you said a hurricane is on the horizon. But today, you\u2019re holding firm, which you\u2019re sending $7 billion expense guidance for 2022. I mean, it\u2019s like you\u2019re acting like there\u2019s sunny skies ahead. You\u2019re out buying kayaks, surfboards, wave runners just before the storm. So, is it tough times or not? Jamie Dimon : Let me -- first of all, we run the Company -- we\u2019ve always run the Company consistently investing, doing stuff through storms. We don\u2019t like pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets, out of markets through storms. We manage the Company, and you\u2019ve seen us do this consistently since I\u2019ve been at Bank One. We invest, we grow, we expand, we manage through the storm and stuff like that. And so what I -- and I mentioned to all of you on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in good shape. They\u2019re spending money. They have more income. Jobs are plentiful. They\u2019re spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus more than pre-COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they\u2019re in good shape. They\u2019re doing fine. We\u2019ve never seen business credit be better ever like in our lifetimes. And that\u2019s the current environment. The future environment, which is not that far off, involves rates going up, maybe more than people think because of inflation, maybe stagflation, maybe soft -- there might be a soft landing. I\u2019m simply saying there\u2019s a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard landing, driven by how much rates go up, effect of quantitative tightening, the effect of volatile markets, and obviously, this terrible humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the effect of that on food and oil and gas. And we\u2019re simply pointing out, those things make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different. It\u2019s not going to change how we run the Company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We\u2019re going to run the Company. We\u2019re going to serve more clients. We\u2019re going to open our branches. We\u2019re going to invest in the things, and we\u2019ll manage through that. We do -- if you look at what we do, our bridge book is way down. That was managing certain exposures. We\u2019re not in subprime fundamentally. That\u2019s managing your exposures. So, we\u2019re quite careful about how we run the risk of the Company. And if there was a reason to cut back on something we would, but not only we think it\u2019s a great business. It\u2019s got great growth prospects. It\u2019s just going to go through a storm. And in fact, going through a storm, we will -- that gives us opportunities, too. I always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in 10 years. We\u2019re here to serve clients through a thick or thin, and we will do that. Mike Mayo : So clearly running the Company for the next 5 to 10 years. If we have a recession in the next 5 to 10 months, how does technology help you manage through that better, whether it\u2019s credit losses, managing for less credit losses, expenses, more flexibility or revenues may be gaining market share? What\u2019s the benefit of all these technology investments if we have a recession over the next... Jamie Dimon : Mike, I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day, for example, AI, which we spend a lot of money on. We gave you a couple of examples, but one of them is we spent $100 million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process payments on the consumer side, losses are down $100 million to $200 million. Volume is way up. That\u2019s a huge benefit. I don\u2019t think it wants to stop doing that because there\u2019s a recession. And so -- and plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper, branches are enormously -- bank are enormously probably. We\u2019re going to keep on doing those things. And we\u2019ve managed through recessions before. We\u2019ll manage it again. I\u2019m quite comfortable to do it quite well. We stop starting on recruiting or training or technology or a branch, that\u2019s crazy. We don\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve never done that. We didn\u2019t do it in \u201808 and \u201809... Mike Mayo : The only other thing is just market revenue is a lot weaker, right? I mean the market outlook is worse. And so, we know you\u2019ve had a structural spending. So when all else equal, that would be a little bit less then. Jamie Dimon : But that\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s very performance-based too. And again, Mike, the way I look at it a little bit in 15 years, the global GDP -- or 20 years, the global GDP, global financial assets, global companies, companies over 5 -- $1 billion will all double. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building for. We\u2019re not building for like 18 months. Operator : The next question is coming from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago. Can you elaborate on QT and the impact that you\u2019ve seen? Now granted that I know June was not full QT of $95 billion a month. But, can you guys give us a flavor? And I think, Jamie, you mentioned that -- if I heard it correctly, that maybe $300 billion to $400 billion of deposits could outflow over time, I am assuming due to QT. But can you guys elaborate what you saw in June? Is it tracking the way you think it\u2019s going to be? And any further outlook for what the deposits could be over the next 12 months due to QT? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Hey Gerard. So, as you know, QT just started. So, I think it\u2019s not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and then sort of track it sector by sector, because you can see the clear impact on system-wide deposits, but that also interacts with RP and TGA and stuff like that. And so how that flows into the banking system and then to any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer segments is kind of a tricky thing. So, it\u2019s early on that. But, at a high level, and your comments to what Jamie said before are right. The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in deposits in the banking system, and we would see our share of that. But we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily come out of the non-operating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could, in theory, have a little bit of a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the strength of the franchise and the ability to take share. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up, I don\u2019t believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book. But two questions. And Jamie, you\u2019ve been very clear about this for the last 10 years, how you\u2019ve derisked that balance sheet, and you mentioned that already today. Can you just give us some color on how different it is today from \u201808, \u201809, just so investors know that it is meaningfully different. And second, what caused the write-down in the bridge book this quarter? Jamie Dimon : So, if you go back to \u201807, I think, the whole Street bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole Street bridge book today is 100 or under 100. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. It\u2019s like 20%. Jamie Dimon : Our percent of that bridge book has come down substantially just in the last 12 months. And that\u2019s really just underlying loan by loan by loan, and you win some and you lose some. And if you guys look at high-yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds are down 6%. That\u2019s what you see. So, you have some flex, you don\u2019t have some flex. And we\u2019re big boys. We know that, and there are write-downs of a couple of bridge loans. They\u2019re not huge. They\u2019re just -- I think they were in the investment banking line. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. It\u2019s in the IB revenue line, and there\u2019s a small amount in the commercial bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in leveraged finance. So, we feel good about where we are. We\u2019re still open for business with the right deals at the right risk appetite upside on the right terms, absolutely, but we\u2019ve been careful. Operator : The next question is coming from Erika Najarian from UBS. Erika Najarian : I just had a few follow-up questions. The first is on balance sheet management. Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3, did that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billion-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non-operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well, please. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, hey Erika, sure. So first point, you have to turn over your magnifying glass. But if you look at Footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it says, assumes flat RWA in the projection, so. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be, and you\u2019ve heard Jamie\u2019s comments on that. But if you look at the table above, you see that you\u2019ve got the usual moving parts. We\u2019ve got organic loan growth that we want, that\u2019s been profitable on its own or part of important relationships that we\u2019d like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit passive. We can\u2019t really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like war. And then there\u2019s the mitigation piece of it, which we\u2019re going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client nexus or both. So across those three bits, we\u2019ll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we\u2019ll see how it goes. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we\u2019ve heard your caution about the economy. And I think there\u2019s a bigger debate on how the U.S. consumer is going to be impacted in light or in context of a downturn. The statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy starting point for the consumer that you bank. And the reserve build for loan growth in card and the less than 2% loss rate in card lead us to believe that your consumer is still okay. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how does the U.S. consumer perform? Because it feels like that\u2019s the big wildcard, and we\u2019ve seen the journal term a job for recession. I just wanted to get your thoughts there. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So first, I just want to point out that on that chart, that\u2019s not a forecast for what it is going to be at the end of the quarter. So, we\u2019re going to -- if you\u2019re going to pencil some of your models, it\u2019s 12.5% on December 31, and it\u2019ll probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And because obviously, we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer -- I feel like a broken record. The consumer right now is in great shape. So, even we go in a recession, they\u2019re entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they\u2019ve been -- did in \u201808 and \u201809 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful. Now, of course, jobs may disappear. Things happen. But they\u2019re in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects consumer income and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it\u2019s exceptional. But again, we\u2019re adults in that. We know that if you have a recession, losses will go up. We prepare for all that, and we\u2019re prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We\u2019re not going to just immediately run out of it. And so, I think it\u2019s great the consumer is in good shape. And it\u2019s excellent that -- I\u2019d like the fact that wages are going up for people at the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentiful. I think that\u2019s good for the average American, and we should applaud that. And so, they\u2019re in good shape, right now. Operator : The next question is coming from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. The next question is coming from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, just one for -- a couple of follow-ups, Jeremy. In terms of the markets have gone very quickly from pricing in a ton of rate hikes to potentially pricing and rate cuts next year, just talk to us like how that\u2019s informing your ALCO balance sheet management as you think about hedging downside risk from lower rates 12 to 18 months out? Like, should we expect you to add duration or do anything synthetic to protect against lower rates? Jamie Dimon : We\u2019re going to keep that to ourselves. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. But I don\u2019t know, maybe if you want a little bit of general color about how we\u2019re thinking about the portfolio. I do think -- yes, okay. I\u2019ll keep it brief. The -- on duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-year yields, the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then, the other piece of it is whether there\u2019s the opportunity to deploy cash into non-HQLA securities broadly into spread product. And obviously, spread product is more attractive right now. But as we\u2019ve been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital. So, that will be something for later, I would say. Jamie Dimon : And I should just point out, the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime. We don\u2019t necessarily make investments based on the forward curve. And second, we\u2019ve always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of outcomes, not just to try to add NII. So, if you said add NII next quarter, yes, we could do that. That would be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes here, which is to protect the Company through all possible outcomes. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on credit. I heard your comments on the consumer if we enter some version of a mild recession, like if you had to pick one or two areas, where do you think losses would be driven by? Is it on the commercial side? Is it CRE? Like, how do you expect that downturn to kind of play out? Jamie Dimon : I think at Investor Day, you had a chart that showed through-the-cycle losses? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, I mean I would just go back to that and we show -- we think through-the-cycle, loss would be for credit cards, C&I and a bunch of other things. And obviously, through-the-cycle is an average, and you can kind of double that from... Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale. So, whether or not that\u2019s a prediction of the future or not, but yes. Operator : The next question is coming from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Sorry about that. I got disconnected. Sorry if I missed this, but if we think about provisioning or reserving for a moderate recession, what\u2019s the best guess on how much that might be? I think for COVID, it was around $14 billion ex CECL. But obviously, you alluded to the consumer being better. The loan mix has changed. There\u2019s lots of puts and takes. But, how would you frame kind of total reserve build\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Let me state very simply for you. In COVID, we got to 15% unemployment within three months. And in two quarters, we added $15 billion, which we can easily handle. That is clearly -- I would put that almost out of the worst case. It will clearly be a lot less than that. And you guys can look at the things yourselves. Every 5% is another $500 million or something like that, if you change your odds, and so. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, we think the current reserve, the current allowance, we think, is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios. And as you know, it\u2019s already kind of skewed to the downside and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there. So, we\u2019ll see how it goes. We feel that it\u2019s just appropriate and conservative at this point. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, separately, you\u2019ve got about $14 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature. What\u2019s kind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here? Jamie Dimon : 10 basis points a year. Jeremy Barnum : Of CET1, yes. Matt O\u2019Connor: Right, 10 basis points, you said? Jeremy Barnum : 10 basis points of CET1 a year. Jamie Dimon : [Indiscernible] Jeremy Barnum : After -- yes, after tax. Jamie Dimon : Basically five years. It kind of bleeds back in over 5 years. Jeremy Barnum : Weighted average life of four or five years, yes. So, the good rule of thumb on constant rates is about 10 basis points of CET1 accretion a year. Operator : At the moment, there are no further questions in the queue. Jamie Dimon : Folks, everybody, thank you very much. And we\u2019ll be talking to you in a quarter. Operator : Thank you. Everyone, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you all for joining and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 18%. The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in Corporate of $959 million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling U.S. Treasuries and mortgages. Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment. Touching on a few highlights. We had a record third quarter -- we had record third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion, we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit is still healthy with net charge-offs remaining low. On page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion was up $3.1 billion or 10% year-on-year. Excluding the net investment securities losses, it was up 13%. NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billion or 24%, largely driven by lower IB fees and the securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year-on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5 billion included net charge-offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of $808 million included a $937 million build in Wholesale, reflecting loan growth and updates to the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending. On the balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI. RWA was down approximately $23 billion quarter-on-quarter, with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk RWA. Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter and 13% in the first quarter of 2023. These current targets include a 50 basis-point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibility over the coming quarters. To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk-based requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So, we announced the call of $5.4 billion in press this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting on page 4. Before I review CCB\u2019s performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, with combined debit and credit spend up 13% year-on-year. Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments. However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits year-on-year, particularly in the lower income segments. And not surprisingly, small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks and the economic outlook. Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which was up 14% year-on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60% year-on-year, making us the fastest-growing among the top 20 banks. And we are now number one in L.A., in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top ranked in the three largest markets. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by flows, while lending revenue was down 34% year-on-year on lower production margins and volume. Moving to Card & Auto. Revenue was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18%. And while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 35%, due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates. Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, driven by the investments we\u2019re making in technology, travel, marketing and branches. In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $679 million, which were up $188 million year-on-year, largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending. Card delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.7 billion was down 43% year-on-year. IB fees were down 47% versus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our number one rank with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity. In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline is healthy, conversion will, of course, depend on market conditions. Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher NII on loan growth. Moving to Markets. Revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in securitized products. Equity Markets were down 11% against a record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity. Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was relatively flat year-on-year. Expenses of $6.6 billion were up 13% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486 million. Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $761 million was down 43% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Deposits were down 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of non-operating balances, while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking. Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charge-offs remained low. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.2 billion, with pretax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year-on-year, driven by compensation, including investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management initiatives. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion across fixed income, equities and alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year-on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1 billion, down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $125 million year-on-year. Next, the outlook on page 9. Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm-wide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be approximately $19 billion, implying full year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion. While we\u2019re not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 NII ex Markets run rate of $66 billion, with potential upside for the full year 2023. Today\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of $76 billion. And from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full year 2023. In addition, there\u2019s quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice and loan growth. So, keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models. Moving to expenses. Our outlook remains unchanged. And as it relates to the card net charge-off rate, we now expect the full year rate to be approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations. So to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks. Jamie Dimon : Jeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I just wanted to give you a little more insight to how we\u2019re looking at capital and interest rates a little bit. So capital planning, we\u2019re very comfortable with the earnings power of this company, which, you can see, is enormous and the margins and the returns. And more importantly than that is we\u2019re growing franchise value, I think, all around the Firm. And in most areas, we\u2019re up in market share, in a few areas, we\u2019re not, and of course, that disappoints us. But the earnings power gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll get over that 13% in the first quarter. But we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things. So, we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don\u2019t know when and how this is going to be, and any change in GSIB such as an uncertainty in back of our mind. AOCI: AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but this kind of environment is more pro-cyclical. So, think of it as rates go up another 100 basis points, that\u2019s $4 billion, easily can handle it just in the back of our mind. CECL: CECL already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets worse, we\u2019ll have to add to reserves. And/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher, we\u2019ll change our reserves. Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you\u2019re probably talking about $5 billion or $6 billion over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just doesn\u2019t affect capital a little bit. And then, RWA management, I mean, I think we\u2019re showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that. With that what I would say, a very limited financial effect. And the way you should look at this is, we don\u2019t tell commercial bank or investment bank don\u2019t get new business, don\u2019t serve your clients. So we\u2019re serving clients the way we always do, and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas, but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us. So, we\u2019re not putting -- conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate the most part, because it makes very low sense to do that in the balance sheet, and we make other choices. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we\u2019re going to find ways to reduce RWA. I\u2019m talking about over years strategically, I think without affecting our basic franchises. Interest rates : I think the way to look at it is we\u2019re fairly neutral at this point, interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion, please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today. And I\u2019m just going to mention a few. We\u2019re not worried about them. It\u2019s not going to change things dramatically, but does change things. What\u2019s going to be QT\u2019s effect on deposits? How much deposit migration you\u2019re going to have in this new technological environment? And there are pluses and minus from that. And of course, there are lags. There are lags in consumer. There can be some lags in treasury services. There can be some lags in commercial banking. So it\u2019s just on the back of the mind, we\u2019re going to kind of actively manage that. And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part, it could be want to sell our rich securities and replacement chief securities. We don\u2019t want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better. So, you might expect to see that taking place now. There may be some securities loss in the future, we can do that. We\u2019re not doing -- we can do this to manage interest rate exposure. But for the most part, we can do that with swaps to or other things. We just do it the most efficient and effective way. I want the people that manage these portfolios to know that we can sell things we don\u2019t want to own and buy things that we do want to own. And other than that, we think it was a very, very good strong quarter across the board. And I guess, we\u2019ll open for questions now. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Let\u2019s go ahead and open up for questions. Operator : Please stand by. And the first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie\u2019s comments there. Obviously, one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta. So just starting to see it, it looks like in terms of deposit costs starting to increase. So, how do you think about it now in this new environment, where we might go to 4.5, maybe higher in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you\u2019ll recall that Jen said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we\u2019re now seeing, as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we\u2019re seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle, just through the actuals. And the question was why is that? And it\u2019s, of course, we don\u2019t really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lagged, but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles. So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point, that will start to come out. Obviously, in wholesale, they come out much faster. That\u2019s probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. And then just the second follow-up on Jamie\u2019s points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead -- looking ahead, you might have to build a little bit more understandable over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario now -- scenarios build and just today, it still looks great, tomorrow, there\u2019s some more uncertainty. So, how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta? And how do you think about it versus either, I don\u2019t know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It\u2019s very hard for all of us to see this, of course. Jamie Dimon : Yes. As you know, I think CECL has informed us the bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on it because it\u2019s not a real number. It\u2019s a hypothetical probability-based number. And the way I\u2019m trying to make it very simple for you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up $15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that. Okay? And all it did swing all these numbers, and it didn\u2019t change that much. I\u2019m trying to give you a number, obviously, this number to be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 60%, [ph] and that becomes the central kind of case, and then you have possibilities it gets better and possibilities it gets worse, we would probably add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters. I mean, that\u2019s as simple I can make it. Right now, what we have -- right now, we already have a percent in these adverse -- in severe adverse case. We can -- if we change that next quarter, that will be part of that $6 billion I\u2019m talking about. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just following up, Jamie. So I appreciate CECL and the model-based approach. I think you were quoted in the press talking about the potential for a recession in the next 6 to 9 months. Would appreciate any perspective in terms of are you beginning to see cracks, either be it commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter through to your clients? I would appreciate any insights there. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I\u2019ll take that, Ebrahim. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no. We just don\u2019t see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side. But we\u2019ve done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that. And we do see, in some cases, some tiny increases. But generally, in almost all cases, we think that\u2019s normalization, and it\u2019s even slower than we expect, so. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I think, we\u2019re in an environment where it\u2019s kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers, you see it in other people\u2019s numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% pre-COVID. Balance sheets are very good for consumers. Credit card borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see -- and that\u2019s really good. So, you go in a recession, you\u2019ve got a very strong consumer. However, it\u2019s rather predictable if you look at how they\u2019re spending and inflation. So, inflation is 10% -- reduces that by 10%. And that extra cap -- money they have in the checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year. And then, of course, you have inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil -- volatility war. So, those things are out there, and that is not a crack in current numbers, it\u2019s quite predictable. It will strain future numbers. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the systems, be it the UK gilts market, LBOs. How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world? Jamie Dimon : I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it\u2019s a very large change in the flow of funds around the world, who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt. There\u2019s a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at -- the tilting [ph] alone is a bump, it\u2019s not going to change what we do or how we do it. And you\u2019re going to see bumps like that because all of the things I already mentioned. It\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don\u2019t know. I have pointed out, it\u2019s harder for banks to intermediate in that, and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that you\u2019re going to see a crack of some sort. But again, it\u2019s almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the fact where I told you. Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Hey, Jeremy, at the Investor Day, you noted that expense growth in \u201823 would slow from this year\u2019s level and might be slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time. So, is that -- now that you get closer to next year, does that still hold? And if the economy does get worse than expected, is there some levers to pull, or is it just still investing heavily regardless? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Jim. So broadly, yes, it still holds. No real change on the outlook. Just to remind everyone, at Investor Day, I think the consensus was 79.5 for 2023. We said you were a little low. I think it got revised up to sort of the 80.5 or something like that. And that\u2019s still -- that\u2019s not -- still roughly in the right ballpark. Obviously, we\u2019re going through our budget cycle. We\u2019re looking at the opportunity side and the environment set for next year. So, it\u2019s not in stone. But broadly, on the question of investment, and I\u2019m sure Jamie will agree here that our investment decisions are very much through the cycle decisions. And so, we\u2019re not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short-term economic environment. Of course, the volume and revenue-related expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect. Jamie Dimon : Now, I would just like to add. Obviously, compensations go up or down dramatically. So, you\u2019ll have different estimates about investment banking revenues and markets revenues, and we can\u2019t really adjust for your numbers for that. But I just want to point out the other side of this, we\u2019re making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business. I think that\u2019s a very good thing. Jim Mitchell : Right. And maybe on that front, leverage loan -- were there any leverage loan write-downs this quarter? And is that -- and how do you -- is that market beginning to clear, or are there still overhangs? Jamie Dimon : There are no real levels of loan write-down this quarter, and that market isn\u2019t yet clear. We own -- our share of it is very small. So, we\u2019re very comfortable. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous. John McDonald : Jeremy, I wanted to ask about your EAR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures. They look a little different than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you\u2019re liability-sensitive. Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, John. And I\u2019d love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I\u2019m going to keep it short here. It\u2019s really all about lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EAR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state. As you well know, right now, we\u2019re in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we\u2019ve experienced this year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we\u2019ve revised our NII outlook from 50 at the beginning of the year to now 61.5. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities or rate fluctuations given the lag environment that we\u2019re in. John McDonald : And just to follow up on Jamie\u2019s comments about not annualizing the fourth quarter, is that where the risks lie to annualize in the fourth quarter? What are some of the puts and takes that -- you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized? Jamie Dimon : Yes. I\u2019ve already mentioned, you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration. Everyone does EAR differently. So, one is lag. One is we assume deposit migration. Some people don\u2019t. We assume -- our ECR is included there, some people don\u2019t and all of that. I just think for your models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the 19. So, instead of 76, use a number like 74. Just keep it as simple as possible, and we don\u2019t know. We hope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, I just -- you just got to be a little cautious and conservative. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Erika Najarian : I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So, I\u2019m going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year. So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17%, and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about -- your capital build is going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year? Jamie Dimon : Yes. That\u2019s obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we\u2019re very honest. We are -- we\u2019re not over earning in NII, maybe a little bit because the lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are over earning on credit. Think of credit card. And the 1.5%, we\u2019ve never seen a number of that low risk. We\u2019re quite conscious of that. So we don\u2019t drag about the 19% this quarter, figure that\u2019s going to continue but it was not. And obviously, we may adjust that 17 a little bit, but it\u2019s not a material adjustment. We\u2019re going to -- we\u2019ve got a lot of great, bright people. We\u2019re going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like call CCAR is and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisition, for example, they were a non-G-SIFI acquisitions, noncapital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service related. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do over time, and we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we\u2019ll get very good returns. So yes, we\u2019re quite -- and next year is totally dependent on what happens in [Technical Difficulty]. But the other thing I would look at, maybe both given this number of other time, is what would we earn in a recession? We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean -- so I feel very good about that. Erika Najarian : And this is a super micro question as a follow-up for Jeremy. Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter? And should we expect that to be zero next year? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Erika. Jamie Dimon : We\u2019re advancing the Markets businesses at the yield curve. So, you\u2019re earning this and you\u2019re paying to finance the training book. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Erika. I mean, basically, as rates go up, the funding cost goes up. And the offsets on the other side, in many cases, work through derivatives or derivatives like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive. You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn\u2019t expect to see as many changes at least from rates. Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased, one way or the other. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Jamie, once again, I\u2019m trying to reconcile your actions with your words. You\u2019ve said publicly, you mentioned the hurricane. You mentioned a recession. You mentioned look out, and there are all sorts of risks. I don\u2019t think anyone disagrees with that. On the other hand, your reserves to loans are still well below CECL day one. So, your actions with the reserving don\u2019t seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy. So, how do I reconcile the two? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, the way to do that is in our CECL -- in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already. So, it\u2019s in there already. A lot of people work in the CECL reserves. Our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. It\u2019s not set by me because I have to think that the odds might be different than other people. And so -- but I conclude as Jeremy saying. But the numbers are very good. We have some of that. I\u2019m trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here\u2019s what it might will mean for reserves. That may be different because, of course, these calculations change a lot of time. But that will be, Michael, which is another thing, which is CECL, the timing of when something happens is very important. So, if it happens, if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year, that would be very different -- so, it\u2019s going to happen in the first quarter of next year. Mike Mayo : Yes, I just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that... Jamie Dimon : It is. But some loans -- yes, some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life. Mike Mayo : Let\u2019s just cut to the chase. So, where are you versus three months ago? I mean, is it -- you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment and all that. And it\u2019s -- look, like as you said, you have Fed tightening, QT, tighter capital rules for banks. You have like the trifecta of tightening by the Fed and then you have wars and everything else. So I don\u2019t think -- and the stock market supports your view and about all the risks out there, but are things better, worse or the same as they were three months ago? Jamie Dimon : They\u2019re roughly the same. We\u2019re just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events. So -- in my hurricane, I\u2019ve been very consistent, but looking at probabilities and possibilities. There is still, for example, a possibility of a soft land. We can debate what we think that percentage of yours might be different than mine, but there\u2019s a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in a very good shape. And there\u2019s possibility is something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that. Those -- I would not change by possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me. And that\u2019s relatively different point. Mike Mayo : Yes. Last follow-up. I know your investor cycles. You\u2019ve always done that. You\u2019re consistent. But I mean, your headcount increase is probably going to be the highest in the industry. I mean, headcount from 266,000 to 288,000, your CIB, you\u2019re adding headcount. I mean, you did expect weakness in nine months from now, wouldn\u2019t you wait to hire people, maybe get them a little cheaper? Jamie Dimon : No. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, just on the investment spend, could you give us a sense as to the areas that you\u2019re leaning in the most, as we should be thinking about into next year? Because you\u2019ve obviously done a lot this year with regard to technology advancement, companies that you\u2019re buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion, in particular on the consumer side. So, just thinking through is this continuation on those themes, or is there something else we should be looking for? Jamie Dimon : Betsy, it\u2019s exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change. So, take out that deck, we broke out by business kind of investment. Investment spend in tech is pretty much on track for that. Betsy Graseck : And the inflation that drives some of that cost structure, you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere. Is that fair? Jamie Dimon : Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around, look, we don\u2019t need to hold stuff we don\u2019t need to hold, we don\u2019t want to hold with that. That kind of suggests to me that there\u2019ll be more bond restructuring as we go through the next quarter. Is there a reason why you didn\u2019t clean the whole thing up this quarter? Jamie Dimon : No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So, if you look at -- if you looked what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out. They gapped in, we bought. They gapped out, we sold and that kind of stuff, you\u2019re getting 2, getting 2.5s. So you can have different point of views. But, I do expect future bond losses going forward. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s real earnings. So, I think -- but I want our people, our experts in the investment areas to know, if they really want to sell something, we\u2019re going to sell it. We\u2019re not going to sit here and lock ourselves into somebody who\u2019s gotten very, very rich because we feel like we can\u2019t take a bond loss. And remember, it doesn\u2019t affect capital. And in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, we actually have higher earnings going forward. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Jamie Dimon : And let me just add too, like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe. I want our people, when they gapped out -- like 300 or 400 basis points, I want them to be willing to buy. They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to do. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. So, it\u2019s Glenn. So look, from time to time, where things happen in the market, we get these losses like Arcagos and now this UK pension LDI issue. So, my question for you is, besides that, do you have risk in the derivatives book? And is the situation done? It\u2019s more of when you meet with Risk Committee, are there pockets of leverage that you\u2019re considering on these big market moves, whether it be the dollar or rates where we are not thinking of like us, or do you view the LDI issue as an isolated event? Jamie Dimon : I\u2019ll mention, and Jeremy, you might have something to add. So, the LDI thing is a bump in the road. And I think the Bank of England is also trying to get through this thing without changing the policy about monetary policy and QT. And I was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans. And my experience in life has been you have things like what we\u2019re going through today, there are going to be other surprises. Someone is going to be off sides. We don\u2019t see anything looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolio, there\u2019s leverage for certain companies -- there is leverage. So you\u2019re probably going to see some of that. I do think you see volatile markets. You already see very low liquidity. So, something like the LDI think could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that. But so far, it\u2019s a bump in the road. The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong. Glenn Schorr : Would the dollar qualify as one of those super strong moves that could put people offsides? And if so, how do you make sure you protect JPMorgan against that? Jamie Dimon : Well, we\u2019re -- because we\u2019re -- we generally -- we do not -- we\u2019re not taking them. We generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that. But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging markets hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might -- something might happen there. It wouldn\u2019t be -- it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s going to affect JPMorgan that much. In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, I\u2019m not going to [Technical Difficulty] what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle, sovereign struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we\u2019re experiencing right now, but our emerging market franchise folks have been through these cycles before. So, we manage through it. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, both. I appreciate it. Jamie Dimon : Just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade, it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money. We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was shocking. We made money in Argentina every -- almost every year for the last 20 years. And I think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down, but it\u2019s kind of very -- the stability is striking. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : You guys have been talking about the system liquidity with, Jamie, you referenced QT, also the fragility of the system. Can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if the system does have a problem on liquidity? Just this week, you probably saw that the Swiss National Bank upped its reserve, currency swapped lines to $6.3 billion. So, what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if there\u2019s going to be maybe more -- some liquidity issues that could lead to greater problems? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, Gerard, broadly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the U.S. banking system, everyone just has very significant surpluses. And of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RPM loan growth, whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that\u2019s starting from a very, very strong position. So, there\u2019s a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective. Jamie Dimon : Yes. We look at everything from the Fed repo, deposit tightening to net issuance of treasury, net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bid-ask spreads and treasury markets and all that. We\u2019re looking at all of that. The banking itself is extremely strong, extremely strong. It\u2019s not -- what you\u2019re going to see will not be in the banking. And there may be bankers outside somewhere, but it will be somewhere else. It will be somewhere else. It might be in credit, it might be in emerging margins. It might be in FX, but you\u2019re likely to have something like that, you have events like the ones we\u2019re talking about. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, in terms of the investment banking and capital markets businesses, can you guys give us any color into pipelines, how they stood at the end of the third quarter? And as you\u2019re going into the fourth quarter, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of those business lines? Jamie Dimon : Yes. And I\u2019ve always pointed out to you all, the pipelines come and go, okay? You\u2019ve seen that the size, there never had before. So pipeline is not necessarily to see. I would put in your model lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today. Markets, we have no idea. Seasonally, it\u2019s generally a low quarter, the fourth quarter, but we don\u2019t know this quarter because there\u2019s so much activity taking place, and your guess is as good as ours. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters? And besides some of the obvious areas like leverage lending and correspondent mortgage you already talked about, any areas that you\u2019re tightening around the edges? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Matt, let me take your last question first. So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great. And so, we don\u2019t see any need to tighten now, really a lot of consistency there. In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we have said for this year, obviously, only one quarter left, that we\u2019d have high single digits. No meaningful change in that outlook there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates, as you mentioned, and some of the RWA optimization in mortgages. As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions, in terms of both, outstandings and revolve normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it\u2019s going to be, I think, very dependent, especially in wholesale on the macro situation. We know that in recession environments, we tend to see lower loan demand. At the same time, we\u2019ve got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients. So, we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out next year. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I guess, when we read headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll, I mean, why doesn\u2019t that drive some tightening in those businesses? Jamie Dimon : Well, it has. I mean look at the volumes and mortgage have dropped and cars, the quota have dropped and stuff like that. And that\u2019s already in our numbers, and we would expect that to continue that way. Operator : The last question is coming from the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. Charles Peabody : Yes. I\u2019m just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate. Next year, do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program, which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system, and therefore, keep your deposit betas lower? Do you think about that at all as a possibility? Jamie Dimon : Yes. I think I -- I don\u2019t know if you were listening when I said it before. QT, net issuance in mortgages, net issuance in treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely incorporated that our thinking, including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re being -- trying to be conservative in NII, that while you can annualize the 19 to 76, it\u2019s going have a model, put in 74 and it incorporates all of that. Operator : At the moment, there are no further questions on the line. Jamie Dimon : Well, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll talk to you all next quarter. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Everyone, that concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you all for joining, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

[Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had two significant items in corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities loss. Touching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year, with growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending. We ended the year ranked at #1 for global IB fees with a wallet share of 8% and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72% driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year. Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty. Looking at the full year results on Page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting on Page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data. Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year. Now moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on-year. You will notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customers. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20% and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And then auto originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by auto lease depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also note that it will be a difficult compare against last year\u2019s first quarter. Moving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment. Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels. Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year. Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non-operating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% [ph] sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management and performance and placement fees linked to this year\u2019s market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in our Private Banking Advisory teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across equities and fixed income and $47 billion for the full year. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year respectively driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the two significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year. With that, let\u2019s pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10. I will take a sip of water. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run-rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023. Going through the drivers. The outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a nice tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumers. In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale. But it\u2019s very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and maybe quite different from what this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII. As the guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates, but remember, this is offset in Markets NIR. Now turning to expenses on Page 11, we expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers, we expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run-rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth as well as our plans from a modest headcount increase in the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments. And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it\u2019s a more modest increase than last year. The themes remain consistent and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent as always. Moving to credit on Page 12, on the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, card and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook, for card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at our recent conference and our outlook hasn\u2019t really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs. And it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year, with the associated charge-offs following about 6 months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022, but still well below fully normalized levels. So let\u2019s turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap up before going to Q&A. We are very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I have emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near-term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE. And with that, operator, let\u2019s open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook, Slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide. As you mentioned, it looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes? Jeremy Barnum : Sure, John. I mean I wouldn\u2019t take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That\u2019s just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as we all know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII and also that there is \u2013 as we have already talked about, a meaningful [Technical Difficulty]. The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says. And the drivers within that are the usual drivers in wholesale. We would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, especially of the non-operating type balances. And you are going to see some internal migration there out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing over time. In consumer, CDs are flowing right now and we are seeing good new CD production. We have got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And so continued CD production and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is \u2013 well, of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect across the company modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT in the rate cycle and so on. So we have got the best guesses for all of those in the outlook. And of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we will just run the business this year. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model. If you sort of look at the way we are seeing things, obviously, we have got another GSIB stuff coming next year. So say, 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organic capital generation, minus dividends, etcetera and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion of buybacks for this year for 2023. But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have better uses for the money, those will come first and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion and also noting that we are potentially going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter or maybe the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR and it will only cover part of the surface area and it won\u2019t be final, so it\u2019s unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making. There will be some information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, I appreciate that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this year\u2019s NII forecast in particular. But to follow-up with John\u2019s question, I\u2019m wondering if you could give a sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you\u2019re expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit beta. I think the feedback I\u2019m getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds that\u2019s occurring for NII this year. At the same time, you have been consistently beating what seems like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion number in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s why I think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that? Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Erika. So look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we\u2019re trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we\u2019re honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year. I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely. And that\u2019s just a level of precision that we\u2019re just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we will be faced with as a company or respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with the strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said. Jamie, on [indiscernible] Jamie Dimon : Erika, thank you. I do want to give a big picture about why and I do not consider 74 conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in fee bills, money market funds. And of course, banks are competing for the cap of money now, and banks are all in different places. And some banks are started competing heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less. But if you look at prior \u2013 and forget what happened in 2016. I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We\u2019ve never had this queued this zero rates. We\u2019ve never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CD, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are competing for it, and we\u2019re going to have to change saving rates. Now we can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don\u2019t know the timing, but it will happen. And I just also want to point out that even at 74, we\u2019re earning quite good returns. And that\u2019s not \u2013 and we\u2019ve always pointed out to you that sometimes we\u2019re over earning and sometimes are under earning. But I would say, okay, this time we\u2019re over earning on NII this quarter. We\u2019re maybe over earning on credit. We maybe underearning something else. So these are still very good numbers, and we\u2019re going to wait and see and we will report to you, but I don\u2019t want to give you false notions how secure it is. Erika Najarian : And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let\u2019s zoom out for a second here. To your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession. And I\u2019m going to reask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day, even with the headwind in NII and the headwind on the provision? Jamie Dimon : Yes, we can. But a lot of factors could turn that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTC will be if we have a real recession, which I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company, which is good. So we\u2019re going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow. And 17% is \u2013 remember 17% is very good if you compound. Some growth is 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point, we don\u2019t know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point. Jeremy Barnum : And Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point as I want to be crystal clear about this. So as you know and as we discussed a lot, like through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it\u2019s anchored around our economist central case forecast, which is correctly, say, is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that\u2019s embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an [allowance] (ph) perspective. So we just want to be clear about. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying. If you could give us a sense of what\u2019s assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate and your outlook around, just a lot of chatter around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop? Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points in CRE customers given what\u2019s happening with cap rates and then just the overall backdrop today? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small Class A best developers, best locations. So the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business. And so yes, so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So yes, as I said, like the central case economic forecast has a mild recession and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect a slightly more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that\u2019s notably higher than that. So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we\u2019ve talked about in the presentation, they are definitely \u2013 can capture something more than a very mild soft lending. But of course, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to reflect a full-blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up on you\u2019ve managed RWA growth pretty well when you look at like loan growth year-over-year versus RWA, stayed relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We\u2019re continuing to work very hard, and it\u2019s a big area of focus. Some of that is reflected in this quarter\u2019s numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in market with RWA. And yes, but we should be clear that although we\u2019ve said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material economic headwind for the company, they are also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we\u2019re making as a result of this capital environment. And in a Basel III outcome, that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective. There will be additional consequences to that. We obviously are hoping that\u2019s not the case and believe that it\u2019s not appropriate, but we will see what happens. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. I\u2019m curious, I want to talk levered loans for a second. You\u2019ve done a good job avoiding some of these \u2013 put on these loans for the like the better half of the last half year. So good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. However, bank balance sheets, not yours, are still kind of mucked up with a lot of the back book. I\u2019m curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. A couple of things there, Glenn. So short answer is we\u2019re absolutely open for business there. Terms are better, pricing is better. We have the resources needed. We\u2019re fully there. No overhang and no issue. Also, I think there is a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang, we\u2019re not convinced that, that\u2019s true. We think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize your point. I think it\u2019s an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of bank\u2019s ability to finance activity. Glenn Schorr : Interesting. So maybe a bit asking, more so. Okay. Maybe, Jamie, while we have you. In the last annual letter, you talked about low competitive moats and intense competition from all angles, not just fin-tech. And I was just trying to think out loud. Is that better or worse, that competitive landscape in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I\u2019ll just leave it at that for you to see where you go with it. Jamie Dimon : I think it\u2019s the same. You have the Apples, who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs. And obviously, higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fin-tech world and maybe even help some folks. So we expect tough competition going forward. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, you mentioned in your payments business that if you took out the equity investment write-downs, the growth was over 50%. Can you share with us on the equity write-downs, obviously, private equity is going through some challenging times. And I\u2019m assuming that... Jeremy Barnum : It was a gain last year. It wasn\u2019t a write-down this year. Gerard Cassidy : I got it. Okay. I thought there was a write-down there. Okay. Jeremy Barnum : Let me make that clear. sorry about that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Can you \u2013 sticking just with private equity for a moment. Can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity markets to JPMorgan? Is there \u2013 when you think about it from your loan book? Or is it really just an equity investments? And maybe expand upon that. Jeremy Barnum : Sorry, do you want me to take that? Yes, this is a couple of things. So Jamie is right. The headwind year-on-year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that just because of the management alternative accounting standard we were forced to mark up previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So anyway, it\u2019s fine. The point is there is a small write-down this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business performing exceptionally well, both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that talked a lot at Investor Day paying off across fees and value-added services and so on and so forth. And I guess throughout your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space? Did I hear that correctly? Gerard Cassidy : That\u2019s correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down considerably. Is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles they are having? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean I think that\u2019s a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company. Our exposure to the sort of non-bank financial sector are probably defined. And of course, as we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. they are obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First, the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup takes some of that into account? And second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, the quantitative part of the decision-making for building up the reserve. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll give you that answer, but I\u2019m oversimplifying a lot. I would say that. Jamie Dimon : Over simplify. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, yes, I know. I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quarter-on-quarter. I think that\u2019s the best way to think about that, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : And then sure Natural \u2013 yes, go ahead. Jamie Dimon : The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in advance of all the points we\u2019ve made already about the pending capital regime. How do we \u2013 can you help us understand what type of effects that has, if any, on parts of the income statement, whether it\u2019s NII or the trading business? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So if I just take that one. Just assume we\u2019re going to have modest growth in RWA. And in every single businesses, mortgages, loans, derivatives, how we hedge CVA and stuff like that, we take access to manage RWA. Do not \u2013 it does not really affect the business that much. It might 1 day, but it doesn\u2019t affect it today. And so we don\u2019t build in somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And there \u2013 and the biggest opportunity down the road will be a reopening in the securitization markets. and they are still very tight. And I think 1 day, they will reopen. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then on the \u2013 one follow-up, just coming back to the reserving process. Can you just help us understand relative to the 5% peak in 3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average in the 3.9 average baseline? Just where does this fourth quarter reserve get you to? And does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential builds ahead of this mild recession? Jamie Dimon : Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability weight other scenarios. That\u2019s why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn\u2019t change the probabilities in our weighting. But of course, it got worse and the base case got worse. That\u2019s all it is, which still is a good benchmark, you\u2019ll keep in mind, is if we got to a relative adverse case, all that a 6% unemployment, we \u2013 and then once you get there, you assume the average weighting, you have wins. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more. When the base case itself deteriorates, we\u2019re moving closer to relative adverse, that\u2019s all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers. And if I review, like just look at charge-offs like actual results. And so \u2013 and we break this out, but it\u2019s hard to describe, and every bank does it slightly differently, and every bank has a slightly different base case and slightly different weighting of adverse cases, etcetera. And so we\u2019re just trying to make it as simple as possible. Ken Usdin : Yes, I hear you. The challenge at this time is that we\u2019re going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that charge-off. So we\u2019re all trying to just fit for that. But I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie. Jamie Dimon : And once the any base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you\u2019d be adding to $6 billion of reserves before you have charge-offs. Ken Usdin : Exactly. Right. Jeremy Barnum : Hey, Ken, maybe just out of interest. Implied to your question might be a little bit, to what extent does this quarter\u2019s build sort of is a down payment on the $6 billion? And the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth, but in some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward provision in the central case. You could say, subject to the caveat that this is a little bit or not science, that there is some down payment on that $6 billion. Ken Usdin : Yes. Understood. Thanks for all that. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Jamie Dimon : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to understand a little bit about how you are thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked already about how it\u2019s hard to predict NII. Obviously, markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you are thinking about delivering operating leverage? Where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested and so you really can\u2019t touch? And where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line, you can still deliver positive operating leverage? Jamie Dimon : Sure. So, I mean as we have \u2013 as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category that you are addressing is the volume and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should pre-symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage. So, for example, in this year\u2019s ultimate outcome, and the number that we want on printing on Page 22, the year-on-year change in volume and revenue-related expense, still we are finding the numbers, we will probably show you more at the Investor Day, but it\u2019s probably close to $1 billion. In other words, year-on-year decline, whereas next year, we are assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook sort of \u201821 to \u201822, \u201822 to \u201823 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually. And so for example, if we wound up being long about the type of environment that we are budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop in the volume and revenue-related expense number that\u2019s in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest of it, we are always generating efficiency. And we have worked just as hard at that, whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so broadly, our investment plans really should be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the card business, in particular, the math of what we expect the NPV of those things to be the cycle may change in a downturn. And that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we are making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of both the environment and... Betsy Graseck : Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan stock has been around the capital charges, the capital march. And will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years? As you deliver on the positive operating leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital obviously and still hit those IRR and ROTCE target on incremental investments. Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you are expecting to generate? And maybe that\u2019s an unfair question today, and it\u2019s a better question for Investor Day, but that\u2019s kind of the debate that\u2019s out there on the stock. Jeremy Barnum : Got it. I mean it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s a good question. I am not going to answer it super specifically. And Jamie may have some views there too. But let me just quickly say, we have kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company\u2019s ability to generate 17% in the cycle. And that\u2019s incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of \u201824. The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is of course, impossible to answer right now. But I would remind you that it\u2019s not just denominator of our expansion, unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy, which goes into the numerator too. It\u2019s not what we want, but that is the possible outcome. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi. I recognize you are evolving your business model and you are spending money to make more money and that your track record last decade was strong there. But as it relates to Frank acquisition that\u2019s been in the news, I am just wondering what that says about the financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year and the one-fifth increase in expenses over 3 years to your guide of $81 billion in 2023. So, it\u2019s really a question about financial discipline. And I know you can\u2019t go in details on the Frank deal. And look, you earn the purchase price in two days, okay? So, I get that. And if there is fraud, there is only \u2013 you can\u2019t do anything about fraud, but still it\u2019s diverse management resources and attention. So, maybe just in the specifics as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence? Who runs it? And ultimately, who is accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you have investments going across business lines, which is a strength of you guys, but who is ultimately accountable when these investments don\u2019t go the way you want to? And Jamie, you recognized, a couple of years ago at Investor Day, you said, \u201cLook, sometimes you are going to waste money as you are innovating and you are growing.\u201d But ultimately, who is accountable when investment doesn\u2019t go right, like the Frank deal or another deal or some of the other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year? Jamie Dimon : Obviously, Mike, let\u2019s say, a very good question, which we always concerned at. We have always talked about complacency and all things like that. So obviously, when you are getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to make \u2013 have errors. And we don\u2019t want our company to be terrified errors that we don\u2019t do anything. And the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy, which is stasis and depth. So, you have to be very careful when you make an error like you cripple the firm. We are very disciplined and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see in our leverage lending book. You see the success of our investments. You see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in our \u2013 in all these things. And it\u2019s no different for an acquisition. There are \u2013 so the acquisitions are done by the businesses, but it\u2019s also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the business does it. The centralized team does it. We have been doing it for 20 years, like we just started doing something like that. And obviously, there are always lessons learned. And at one point, we will tell you the lesson we learned here when this thing is out of litigation. But we are quite comfortable. And the people who are responsible are the people in the business. So, they \u2013 that business did the acquisition, they are responsible, they report back. And we expect people, when they talk to all of us is the goods, the bad, the ugly. We are never looking for how great everything was. And obviously, this thing in one way or another, it was a huge mistake. Mike Mayo : Let me follow-up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the payments business, which I know is a focus that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in payments, which is \u2013 can be a 20 or 30 PE business, which could be great if you got there, who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes the way you aggregate the data, it\u2019s consumer, it\u2019s the investment bank, it could be asset management, it could be commercial, it can be everything in payments. Who is responsible for those? Jamie Dimon : So, just to be clarified. So, I would say that Marianne and Jen, when it comes to credit, debit, checks and all the consumer-related stuff and Takis, which I think you saw in the presentation about payments at Investor Day reporting to Daniel, and that is on the wholesale payments, merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff and those are direct responsibilities, it\u2019s quite clear this is an area that counts across the company. So, it\u2019s a payments working group that just spends time on that. That working group has not done an acquisition, okay. And if they make \u2013 if they want to invest \u2013 which there are cases, by the way, which you \u2013 and you will see more this year, we decided jointly and all the way up to Daniel and me. Mike Mayo : And then last follow-up to my first start, the general comment. I mean this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth, and you have Slide 11 there. But I mean that\u2019s a lot of certain front-loaded expenses for less certain back-ended benefits. How is your comfort level that you are going to see those back-ended benefits relative to the past? Jamie Dimon : Totally and we try to show you guys at Investor Day, every branch we open, for every bank that we hire, for every tech thing we do, we are pretty comfortable. There are certain things that\u2019s more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud, and stuff like that, which you can\u2019t identify all of that. But we are pretty comfortable that we \u2013 if they weren\u2019t working, we changed them. So, we ask ourselves that question every day with any wealth managers or branches or certain things, so \u2013 and marketing is half of that, not quite half, but half that number. That\u2019s a very specific \u2013 for the most part, very specific dollar in, how many dollars out. It\u2019s not a guess, and we are pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again, if we \u2013 if there is $1 billion that we were spending that didn\u2019t give us the return, we cut the $1 billion. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steve Chubak : Hi, good morning. So, I wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for trading in the investment banking businesses. Just Jeremy, given the strong pipelines you cited, I was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you are hearing from corporate clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in investment banking activity. And similar question on the trading side, you are facing difficult comps in the coming year. We still have QT, rate volatility proxy still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in trading activity or not? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Thanks Steve. So, let\u2019s do banking first. So, I think the thing that\u2019s interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant, obviously, from very elevated levels. But even relative to just 2019, 2022, was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it\u2019s possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. That could conceivably make you pessimistic about the investment banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it\u2019s not as if we are super optimistic. But it\u2019s important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things change in 2022, specifically with respect to rates as that affects the debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and DCM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the all of open market. So, I think there is a chance that, that actually winds up helping in 2023 in the investment banking world. Of course, we don\u2019t know. But those are some of the things that we are thinking about. Similarly, on the markets side, obviously, markets had another very strong year, better than we had expected since the numbers were so strong. Coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continuing markets. As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious, and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, it\u2019s not like the volatility is going away. And markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And 4.5%, 5% rate environment is probably one where there is more trading opportunities than the zero percent rate environment. So, of course, we don\u2019t know. We will see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. It\u2019s \u2013 the numbers are really very strong in markets, but we will see and we will see what happens. Steve Chubak : That\u2019s really helpful color. And just for my follow-up on finalization of Basel III. Sorry, Jeremy, I couldn\u2019t help myself here. But in December speech, you strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You also alluded in your comments or in response to one of the questions that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive. Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how your scenario planning for the eventual finalization and any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation. I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of RWA inflation is op risk, which can\u2019t really be mitigated. What are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential headwinds? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So, Steve, I would love to get into more detail here, but I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases, I mean you studied this issue closely. It\u2019s just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing, it\u2019s a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just like doesn\u2019t make sense to us. So, we just want to say that. But yes, Jamie, please. Jamie Dimon : I mean just, look, you guys know that the operators\u2019 capital, the trading book, the CCAR, G-SIFI, all those moving parts, let\u2019s just see what they are. We will deal with them when we get there. And then we will figure out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to increase capital ratio. We are quite clear on that. One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our total loss-absorbing capacity. So, we have now almost $500 billion. I mean really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, $1 trillion liquidity, all those thing is enough. And so \u2013 but let\u2019s just see what it is. They are going to work it through their international laws, their international requirements. We are hoping that America is the same as international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We will see if that happens. So, let\u2019s just see. We don\u2019t have to guess. And if the number is too high, we are going to tell you what we are going to do about it. Jeremy Barnum : Just a minor expansion to that, just to expand a bit on Jamie\u2019s point that it\u2019s important to be clear, there will be time to adjust, like there is a long road from the NPR to \u2013 so to sort of supports Jamie\u2019s point, let\u2019s see what it is and then we will\u2026 Steve Chubak : Fair enough. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. How do you guys think of the managing the securities book, given the outlook of lower deposits? Obviously, the yield curve is quite inverted depending on what part you are looking at or most parts, frankly. And at the same time, the securities book is cash flowing a lot less than it was a couple of years ago just given the rate environment. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing, but basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion deposits and $1 trillion of loans and things like that. So \u2013 and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things. And so \u2013 and then when you say the size of it, we forecast, which I am not going to give you the numbers, we forecast every quarter what we are going to buy, what we are going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JPMorgan\u2019s lost an ACM loan book as the percentage is much lower than most other people. We are kind of conservative there too. Matthew O\u2019Connor: I guess a bigger picture question. We have seen such a drop in really 5-year to 10-year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren\u2019t really buying, as said, you are selling. And I guess I was wondering if you had thoughts on who is buying and what\u2019s driving the rates so much lower than most people thought they should be at? Jamie Dimon : Yes, we do. But we should get the answer, of course, to get that. We look at it, what everybody is doing, pension plans, governments. We look at every part of the curve. We look at what other banks are doing. I think I have mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different positions. Some may have to sell securities to finance their loan books. We obviously don\u2019t. So, people are in a different position. And as Jeremy pointed out, it\u2019s very important. That yield curve will not be the same six months from now that is today. While we use that to kind of look forward, it\u2019s not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. And with the investment portfolio, we would be invested when there are opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there is a 60 OAS spread. We have sold \u2013 one of the reasons we take securities losses, because that gives you $10-plus billion you can reinvest it when you think of more attractive securities. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The final question is coming from the line of Andrew Lim from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. You may proceed. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one on credit quality. Thanks for giving us a commentary on the shape of NCOs, I guess, specifically for credit cards topping out at the end of this year. Could you give us a bit more color on how reserve builds should shape out this year, I guess with respect to CECL? I am guessing that it should top out quite soon. That\u2019s my first question. Just assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and all the assumptions are unchanged in the property are unchanged and so forth. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Andrew, well, I think we have talked about CECL like quite a bit, and I think there is some decent color there in terms of Jamie\u2019s $6 billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We are definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. But it\u2019s appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment. Andrew Lim : Sure. Okay. Let\u2019s drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think you are still talking about sequential increases in NII. So, I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So, I guess we are hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed fund rate cuts as well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. No. So, let me un-controversially say no there, Andrew, just really wouldn\u2019t doubt. So, my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which we are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that in a world where we are exiting the fourth quarter run rate at 81, and we are telling our ADX markets or whatever. And we are telling you 74 for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We are simply saying don\u2019t project those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense? Andrew Lim : Right. Yes. No. Absolutely, that makes sense. That\u2019s great. Thank you for that. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks. Operator : We have no additional questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Barnum. Jeremy Barnum : That\u2019s it. Thank you very much. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. We will talk to you all soon. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the [JPMorgan Chase\u2019s] First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on page 1. The Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let\u2019s talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and the recent televised interview. So, I will go straight to the specific impacts on the Firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firm-wide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It\u2019s important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook, which I will address at the end, still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter\u2019s inflows. Now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share. Consumer spending remained solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year. And credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the Company. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex markets was down $1.1 billion or 10% driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume. And markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs, reflecting the annualization of last year\u2019s headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter, which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted average economic outlook. Onto balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion and net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid, and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher-yielding products, as you would expect, but were encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our Wealth Management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on Page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number 1 with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies in emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity and cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates. And gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition and non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In middle market banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in CapEx spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds for both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in the urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million, predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion, pretax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisory teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by fixed income and equities. And then liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%, driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. Next, the outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook, given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags. We think a more sustainable NII ex-markets run rate in the medium term is well below this quarter\u2019s $84 billion as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance. And while we don\u2019t know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment, including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it\u2019s worth noting that markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses. Our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] From the line of Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steve Chubak : So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks. In your letter, you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. What are some of the changes that your scenario planning for, whether it\u2019s higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you\u2019re thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment? Jamie Dimon : Well, I think you already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we\u2019re hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened, and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road, there may be some limitations on held to maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type size banks and more scrutiny and history exposure, stuff like that. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a revamp of the whole system. It\u2019s just recalibrating things the right way. I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taking, which are drastic, it could actually make them weaker. So, that\u2019s all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV effectively. And obviously, there\u2019s going to be an FDIC assessment. That will be what it is. Steve Chubak : And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the elevated macro uncertainty? Jamie Dimon : Well, we\u2019ve told you -- I think we\u2019ve told you that we\u2019re kind of penciled in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but -- and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter. We\u2019re going to wait and see. We don\u2019t mind keeping our powder dry. And you\u2019ve seen us do that with investment portfolios, and we\u2019re also willing to do with capital. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made. Just in terms of -- is it because of like what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? And maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple of factors. So the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we\u2019re getting a lot of positive feedback from field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It\u2019s been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So, that\u2019s kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve, which is helping. And I\u2019ll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction. And that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all the uncertainty kind of went through the same way. But as Jamie has pointed out, like those uncertainties are all still there. We highlight them on the page. And as we look forward to this year and into next year in the medium-term, we remain very focused on those. Ken Usdin : Yes. And as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in and potentially getting cut sooner, how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy? Is that -- do you think it\u2019s more just because inflation is coming down? Do you think it\u2019s because the Fed has just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of -- just your general thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy. Jamie Dimon : Well, I would -- first of all, I don\u2019t quite believe it. So, the rate curve -- the Fed has the rate curve -- the forward short-term rate curve, almost 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is it could be anything. We don\u2019t know what the rate curve is going to be in the year. And so, we\u2019re quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk, but -- and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit. It could easily be stickier than people think, and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Jeremy, I wanted to follow-up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March, in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons, or they intensify it industry-wide, because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. John, it\u2019s a really good question, and we\u2019ve obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is, it doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not meaningfully affecting our current outlook. We don\u2019t see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it\u2019s just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact. John McDonald : Okay. And then, I wanted to ask Jamie, there\u2019s a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch. Banks are going to stop lending. Even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending that -- and is that a reaction that makes sense that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks. Jamie Dimon : I wouldn\u2019t use the word credit crunch, if I were you. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a little bit of tightening. And most of that will be around certain real estate things. You\u2019ve heard it from real estate investors already. So I just look at that as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the finance conditions will be a little bit tighter, increases the odds of a recession. That\u2019s what that is. It\u2019s not like a credit crunch. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you\u2019re assuming in your reserves. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So Erika, as you know, we take -- I can\u2019t go into a lot of detail here. But we take the outlook from our economists. We run a bunch of different scenarios and we probably weigh those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn\u2019t actually changed. But we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the event of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted average expectation. And I think the weighted average peak unemployment that we\u2019re using now is something like 5.8%. Erika Najarian : So, as we think about all of what you\u2019ve just told us, so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium term is going to happen is mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 was 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024, assuming we do have a recession in \u201824 as everybody is expecting, given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, that\u2019s an interesting question, Erika. I guess, I\u2019ll say a couple of things. Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s a great question. Jeremy answers it. Jeremy Barnum : Okay. Let\u2019s take a crack. Let\u2019s see what the boss thinks. I think, number one, we believe, have said and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise. So number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024, contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously, it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the Company is positioned for a recession, but we\u2019re a bank. A very serious recession is, of course, going to be a headline -- a headwind for returns. But we think even in a fairly severe recession, we\u2019ll deliver very good returns, whether that\u2019s 17% or not is too much detail for now. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You\u2019ve seen some inflows. What\u2019s your -- why do you think they -- you lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing. Do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some pricing power for the larger banks? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. A couple of things there. So first of all, we don\u2019t know, right? The deposits just come in. We don\u2019t know. We\u2019re guessing. Number two, the deposits just came in. So by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us. So, it\u2019s prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won\u2019t be particularly stable. Number three, there\u2019s a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds. So, you have to overweigh that, and that\u2019s embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it\u2019s a competitive market. And it\u2019s entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time, decide to go elsewhere. So for all of those reasons, we\u2019re just being realistic about the stickiness of that. Jamie Dimon : Probably to add, I wouldn\u2019t -- there is -- I would say, category, there\u2019s no pricing power that the bigger banks have. Because if you look at the pricing, and we look at pricing sheets all the time, every bank is in a slightly different position, and every bank is competing in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There\u2019s no pricing power for the bank, but obviously, we\u2019ll have different franchises as well as slightly different position. Jim Mitchell : All fair points. And maybe just a follow-up on John\u2019s question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through, is there a potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity, or how are you thinking about the loan environment? Jamie Dimon : We say very modestly, but we look at that all the time. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we don\u2019t loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic. And we\u2019re not going to like overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction happens naturally. Credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers, whether in consumer or wholesale and that might make them leave our pre-existing risk appetite. But we\u2019re not running around aggressively tightening standards right now. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously, came in strong at 13.8%. You\u2019ve got the G-SIB buffers obviously going up next year. And we have the stress test coming this summer or in June, the results, which maybe will lead to banks including yours having a higher stress capital buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of \u201824 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased G-SIB stab and operating with a 50 basis point buffer. So the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, who knows how we\u2019ll tweak that going forward. But that\u2019s still our base case assumption. Specifically, on the stress test, I\u2019ll -- contrary to what I\u2019ve heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you\u2019ll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of 2 in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now, we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets in harsher credit shocks in the numbers. So for planning purposes right now, we\u2019re assuming flat for SCB and we\u2019ll know soon enough what that actual number is. Gerard Cassidy : Sure. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color? I think you mentioned in building the loan loss reserve this quarter, you identified some one-off credits. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how you said it. There\u2019s some larger credits. Were they commercial real estate orientated? Were they commercial? Any more color there? Jeremy Barnum : No, it wasn\u2019t commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment. Gerard Cassidy : Leveraged loan type items or just regular corporate credits? Jamie Dimon : Regular corporate credits. I\u2019d rather not get into too much detail\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : Okay, very good. Jamie Dimon : Gerard, sorry. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy, you reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM, but obviously, you\u2019re big players in the CRE market. So give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE 1, how much is oversupply, and that probably goes beyond office into apartments, how much of an issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for long gates in that, if the central banks can\u2019t cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the refi wall that\u2019s coming up? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Ebrahim, let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily lending in supply-constrained markets. And I think it\u2019s quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher-end, higher price point, non-rent-controlled, not supply-constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect. And I think that\u2019s a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully, and we don\u2019t assume that past performance predicts future results here. But I think our multifamily lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. Jamie Dimon : Just to add also, housing is in short supply in America. So, it\u2019s not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. And then, in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie has also mentioned all the refi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very concentrated in Class A buildings and sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers is generally in favor of high occupancy. So again, launching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things, for us, not a big issue. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just as a follow-up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is just the ability of the economy, the financial markets to sustain a 5% plus Fed fund for a long period of time. Like what are the other areas you\u2019re watching, if duration mismatch and bank balance sheet, being one, CRE market being one. Are you worrying -- worried about nonbanks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the nonbanks if rates don\u2019t get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the nonbanks? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, I\u2019d like to answer that. So, there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don\u2019t just think of just the Fed funds rate because I think you should -- for our planning, I\u2019d be thinking more about, it could be 6 and don\u2019t -- and then think about the 5- and 10-year rate, which could be 5. And I think if those things happen, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re going to happen. I just think people should prepare for them. They saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people\u2019s expectations. You had the guilt problem in London. You had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates or those who are too exposed to refi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. So now that -- I say to all of our clients, now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That\u2019s answer number one. Number two is it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very -- we think it\u2019s very, very secure. That does not mean it won\u2019t come back to other credit providers. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey, Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending. And I\u2019m just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of the loan pricing, why aren\u2019t your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Mike. So on the -- so I think, yes, you\u2019re referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets, but also access to bank lending that the margin is choosing to draw down on revolvers right now rather than access to capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There\u2019s a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven\u2019t actually, specifically, checked what\u2019s happening with card yields. I would imagine that they\u2019ve gone up a little bit in line with rates. But I don\u2019t know. We should follow up. Mike Mayo : All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess, taking the 10,000-foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management or AUM, you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street, and you\u2019ve seen some big problems at banks. And I guess, how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? Probably is good. But to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that do not get their asset liability management correctly? Jamie Dimon : Well, there\u2019s two really different questions. So, we\u2019ve been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest in our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test -- the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared to -- whether or not anything is going to happen. So, we\u2019ve been quite conservative ourselves. And we don\u2019t mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven\u2019t lost it. It\u2019s kind of earnings in store. You get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time when the time comes. And we\u2019re not -- look, we\u2019d like to help the system when it needs to help if we can reasonably. And we\u2019re not the only ones. You saw a lot of banks do that. And I was proud of them. I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing, whether ultimately, it works out or not, you could second guess that when it happens. But the fact is I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking theme is bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline. And you have Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have -- remember, Mike, as you pointed out, we have the best financial system the world has ever seen. That does not mean it won\u2019t have problems. It doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be changes made, but I think it\u2019s reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that during -- all of us did that during COVID. All of us did that -- if you could, those you could did it during the great financial crisis, and I would expect people do that going forward. Mike Mayo : Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn\u2019t over. So, what do you mean by that, or was that dated 2 weeks later and talking contagion or what? Jamie Dimon : So it\u2019s just -- the number of banks off-sites, you can count in your hands in terms of like too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM, too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank deposits -- I mean, bank failure, something like that, which we don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have -- can take actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You\u2019ve already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million, I don\u2019t know if you saw that, that no depositor will lose money in America. [Indiscernible] own money, of course you know, he is a very bright man. So, this crisis is not away. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is that when I answered the question just before about interest rates, people need to be prepared. They shouldn\u2019t pray that they don\u2019t go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn\u2019t happen, serendipity. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-markets NII... Jeremy Barnum : Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped. Betsy Graseck : Now you hear me? Hello? Jamie Dimon : Yes, you\u2019re back now. You\u2019re back. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact the NII ex-markets? Because I\u2019m trying to triangulate here about maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn\u2019t we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that -- that\u2019s the question. Jamie Dimon : Go ahead, Jeremy. And I\u2019ll... Jeremy Barnum : Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that as the -- like if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive certainly in terms of sort of one-year forward EIR-type measure. You also obviously know that our current EIR actually shows a slight negative number, so it tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won\u2019t get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short term. But the point is that the level of rates now is, of course, very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It\u2019s quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I\u2019ve alluded to a couple of times on this call, the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So, I would just add, so next quarter, we kind of know already, two quarters out, we know a little bit less, three quarters out, we know a little bit less, and \u201824, we know very little. That number, you can imagine, this is a little inside baseball now, the number that we\u2019re talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It\u2019s based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you\u2019re absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that. But remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it, like maybe a recession, taxation, lower volume. So I wouldn\u2019t look at that as higher flows a positive. It might be a slight positive in that line. It probably be negative in other lines. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Got it. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So, do I take your comments to mean that you\u2019re on pause now? And if that\u2019s the case, what would be the driver of restarting? Jamie Dimon : Yes. No, we\u2019re not on pause now. We\u2019re doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when it\u2019s cheap, not just when it\u2019s available. And we\u2019re also peering ahead, looking at those a little bit of storm cloud, so we\u2019re going to be kind of cautious. So we\u2019re going to make this decision every day. We also don\u2019t like to tell the market what we\u2019re doing, just so you know. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for this? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Betsy, we really don\u2019t have any new information there, right? I mean I think, clearly, if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like it\u2019s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it\u2019s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers. So in any -- when the NPR comes, that\u2019s only going to be part of it. There\u2019s going to be other pieces, the holistic review, and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time to phase in, and we\u2019re going to have time to adjust. So, we\u2019ll know when we know. Jamie Dimon : I just remember, they were supposed to be positive in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy, which are getting smaller and G-SIB is supposed to be adjusted for that. So it may vary. We\u2019re expecting to go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn\u2019t go up. And JPMorgan, it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s so much capital. I mean, so you can\u2019t look at JPMorgan and say, well it\u2019s a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it -- even though in some of the banks who have plenty of capital, the issue wasn\u2019t capital. It was other things. And so I\u2019m just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should [ph] decide what they want on the banking at this point. Because I made it clear, I can look at the banking system today and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That\u2019s how much capital is now being required for loans. The loans\u2026. Betsy Graseck : \u2026on the current rule set. Jamie Dimon : Yes, because the market is pricing -- it holds -- the market would take loans at much lower capital ratios than banks are being forced to hold for them. I\u2019m talking about just loans only. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a lot of capital go to -- I mean a lot of the credit go to nonbanks and dramatically, by the way, rapidly and dramatically. And so if you\u2019re a regulator, if you look at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it\u2019s a good thing for the system, raise the capital, more credit will go out of the system. That\u2019s fine. If that\u2019s what they want, that\u2019s fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally. Betsy Graseck : I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale. So I\u2019ll prefer the former, not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So, you talked about in your letter about the regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I\u2019m curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now -- and my point -- my question is, consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways. Move it, treasuries, money markets, extra accounts, whatever. The issue -- the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital? And should they need to? And I\u2019ll say your Warren Buffet comments. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Glenn, and sure, we really haven\u2019t seen big changes to speak of. And I do think it\u2019s just worth saying, I think you\u2019re sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates. But when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that\u2019s obviously very different if you\u2019re talking about large balances of nonoperating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances which is of course, like core banking business for all of us. Jamie Dimon : When you saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and custody, you did see money move -- what I would call, excess cash has moved out. So they have options. What I would call more like operational cash, I think even if small companies, middle market companies, et cetera, that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there. You get more and more competitive in rates. And that\u2019s why I think you see a lot of regional banks. They\u2019ve got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you\u2019re probably going to be leaving in my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So I think you shouldn\u2019t be looking at deposits like one class. They just -- there\u2019s a whole bunch of different types and analytically, you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is and what the stickiness is and et cetera. And so -- but I think they\u2019ve already -- as the Fed has raised rates, you\u2019ve already seen -- that\u2019s the reason we expected outflows, both from consumers and corporate customers. Glenn Schorr : Interesting. Just a follow-up. The other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you\u2019re exploring new capital optimization strategies, including partnerships and securitizations. What\u2019s different than what you\u2019ve already been doing for the last 30 years? Jamie Dimon : We\u2019ve got our smartest people figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That\u2019s the difference. And we\u2019ve been doing it, but there are securitizations, there are partnerships. You\u2019ve seen a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies. And I expect that we\u2019re going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we\u2019ll shed certain assets, too. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And was just wondering if you could flesh out what changed there on the outlook, say, versus three months ago? And I guess, is that a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So the story there is kind of the same story we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. It\u2019s just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period, and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we had pre-pandemic. So I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per account because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so -- and yes, we also, to Mike\u2019s question earlier, we\u2019re seeing higher yield there as well, so. And on your question of whether it\u2019s good or bad, obviously, there is a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don\u2019t see that yet, so. Jamie Dimon : It\u2019s normalization. That\u2019s a good thing for us. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately to squeeze in. You guys took some security losses again this quarter. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about really just going security by security, looking for kind of pricing opportunities. Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some kind of broader overarching... Jamie Dimon : That will be every quarter for the rest of our lives. So we find rich and we buy what we think is dear. Operator : We have no further questions. Jamie Dimon : Excellent. Well, thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 25%. These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion and credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio $1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights, CCB Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM and we ranked Number One in IB Fee wallet share. Before giving you more detail on financials, let me give you a brief updates on the status of the First Republic integration on Page 2. The settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule, the number of key milestone being recently completed. Systems integration is also proceeding at pace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July 2, and we're pleased to have had very-high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in the market, we are happy to see the client retention is strong with about a $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition. Now, turning back to this quarter's results on Page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier. I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this quarter's results at the firm-wide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic, in order to improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter, First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of expense and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain, which is reflected in NIR in the Corporate segment as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1, so the First Republic numbers only represent two months of results. You'll see in the line-of-business results that we are showing First Republic revenue as allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now turning back to firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII, ex-markets, was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex-markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less notable items, primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up $1.5 billion or 8% year-on year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in card. The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the commercial bank and $200 million build in card and a $243 million release in corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and the CET1 ratio. And as you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirements of 4% and it goes into effect in 4Q '23. The new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter. On liquidity, our bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our earnings at-risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we released this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100 basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion, whereas in the absence of the change, it would have been about negative $1.5 billion. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on Page 5. Both U.S. Consumers and Small Businesses remained resilient and we haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results, which I will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion, which was up 31% year-on year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments and seek higher-yielding products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our adviser and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII and higher loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto, originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.5 billion, reflecting the reserve build of $203 million, driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day past delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations. Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked Number One with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30% for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second-half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets, and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is down significantly, which will be a headwind. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed-income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity markets was down 20% against a very strong prior year quarter, particularly in derivatives. Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including fun office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter driven by inflows related to new client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up 2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing. CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior year originations for construction loans and real-estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real-estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real-estate market as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the impact of Global Shares and JPMorgan Asset Management China, both of which closed within the last year. For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes, led by fixed-income and equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million; revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last year; NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates; NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on year, largely driven by higher legal expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting reserve release of the deposit placed with First Republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on Page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-markets to be approximately $87 billion, the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit repricing than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remained and we do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run-rate at some point in the future, as competition for deposits plays out. Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So, to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the Company's ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios. With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : The first question is coming from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. Jim Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Hey Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance. Clearly, Fed funds futures are up, so it makes some sense. But maybe, I guess first, could you kind of discuss, I guess, comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there? So far, it seems to be coming in a little better expected. And then secondly and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher for longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond. I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys have talked about. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jim. So -- yes, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice, hard to untangle the two. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a stable environment from that perspective. And similarly in wholesale, we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would continue to expect -- we would continue to -- we would expect that to continue to take place, probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about the medium-term run-rate in the mid-70s that was before First Republic and you know you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher, but whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment. That's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace, but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point. Jim Mitchell : Okay. But, I guess I just one to follow-up on that, just if we don't get rate cuts until middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice? Jeremy Barnum : I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run-rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number. So, I wouldn't think of it as being particularly rate dependent. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning, Jeremy. And I'm just laughing to myself, because I said to you at Investor Day, do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here, and maybe Jamie I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1 and we hear you loud and clear that your more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III end game, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero, because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different role from a rate scenario and everybody is talking about, even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So, any input on that would be great. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Erika. I mean it's a good question. There is a lot in there obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talk about 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment where we brought the lowest eurobond, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment. And at some level, that remains true today. Furthermore -- you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III end-game, one relevant question might be, if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target. So, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the Company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that. Some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math, simply diluting down the ROTCE by expand the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, you know repricing on products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So, I'm not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power, we will adjust to the higher capital. So lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios, we feel good about our ability to deliver the results and we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out, especially after we see the Basel III proposal and it goes through the common period. Jamie Dimon : Erika, I'll say one thing. Of course we have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to a 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive, so we look at kind of all of them and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're earning on is credit. We've been over in credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite cautious about it. We know that it's going to kick-off just as a normalized it will be, considering more than that is now. Look, we would consider credit card normalized to be closer to 3.5%. Erika Najarian : And, so my follow-up question there, maybe Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate has embedded in your ACL ratio as of the second quarter? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's still 5.8%. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the par speech, we don't have the details yet, but just kind of want to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation, both on RWA and potentially on the G-SIB front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, thanks, John. So, obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a proposal, ultimately sometime this month or something. So sooner or not, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including Chair, Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr's 2% of RWA which runs up being roughly the same, is just the way operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up across-the-board tax on everything. It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception, obviously, of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff, we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track-record of adjusting and optimizing. But this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimizing in a very technical way. John McDonald : Okay, that's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase-in and you generating capital at a high level, even if the ROTCE comes down a bit. How should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple of years? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to stack back investments, right, that won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So, when we know the requirements, I mean when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being, it will be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason, things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see are strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever. John McDonald : Okay, and there is some room for buybacks? Jeremy Barnum : Unlikely, obviously, that would be an unlikely outcome. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Sorry, John, go ahead. Did you have a follow-up? John McDonald : Yes. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple of years, strategically, just episodically you buyback? Jeremy Barnum : I mean, capital hierarchy again, right. In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks and we've talked about the $12 billion for this year. Obviously, lot of new moving parts there, although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yes, that's always going to be at the end of the list, but, yes. John McDonald : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may proceed. Ken Usdin : Well, thanks, good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the investment banking pipeline, and just how it feels in terms of like reopening of markets and the trade-off between getting similar to those fees in versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. A good question, Ken. So I think in terms of investment banking end markets, yes, better-than-expected last month. Well we talked about green shoots, especially in capital markets generally still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower amounts activity, some regulatory headwinds there. So we'll see -- I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations. Generally, we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth. But away from that, for a variety of different reasons at different products, whether it'd be mortgage or C&I, after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there. So we're not really expecting meaningful growth away from card. But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms, we went through-the-cycle. So, I see that as more of a demand-driven narrative, which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side. Ken Usdin : That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that. On the consumer side, you mentioned that consumers continue to spend, albeit a little more slowly and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits, a little bit more as well. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state-of-the consumer and is that is that car growth continued to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits just kind of what the trade-off on that side to. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean to us, I think we still see this as a normalization not deterioration story when we talk about consumer products. Actually revolve per account has still not gotten to pre pandemic levels actually. So, I would definitely say there's a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point. And yes, I think that consumer continues to surprise on the upside here. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jeremy and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the asset-liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year-ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Gerard, I would say, honestly, not much change there actually, no. We've been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've been biased towards higher rates and that maybe a little less true at these levels than it was before, although lot of that is just the consequence of deposit comp actually playing out in modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on making sure we're fine in a higher-rate scenario, while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our positioning and that's obviously, including the fact that we took on First Republic, which even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result, we took actions to ensure that now we are still about the same as we were last quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that you'd had some reserve building tied to some office real-estate and also some downgrades in the middle-market area. Can you go a little deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area of both commercial real estate but at also the C&I loans, what's happening in that segment as well? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, so. I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean. I think that when we talk about office versus, for example. Our portfolio, as you know is quite small, and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multiply lending. So as resolved like our sample size observed valuations on office properties is quite small, but you know, we'd like to be sort of ahead of the cycle. And based on everything that we saw this quarter. So it's reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. Across the rest of the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades and excess of upgrades. But, I don't see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve you there? It looks like his line dropped. Next we'll go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. You may proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess just first question, following-up on the outlook for the economy, like we've all been worried about a recession for year and there is a debate about the lag effects of the Fed rate hike cycle when you think about -- Jeremy, I think you mentioned you have an unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago. How worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle six months to 12 months from now or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the late-cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So I am sure, Jamie has some views here. But in my in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super positive conclusions based on a couple of recent trends. And I think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over concentrates people on one particular predictions when we know that there is a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, we were talking a lot about the potential for a soft lending right now. No lending, neither, it's inflation or whatever and -- whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully. I don't know, but the broader point is we continue to be quite focused on, Jamie's prior comments that loss rates still have time to -- room to normalize even both pandemics we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit, so even, forgetting about whether you've got some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy is always today even in the central case, you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization. Jamie Dimon : Yes. I would just add, the 5.8% is not our prediction, that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which hypothetical for CECL. Asset predictions on something different and we don't know the outcome. We trying to be really clear here, the consumer in good shape, their spending down their excess cash. That's all. Tailwinds. If we go into recession, we're going with rather good condition, low borrowings and good, our price-value still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There is more Ukraine Oil Gas, market, timing, unprecedented fiscal, needs of governments, few team which we've never experienced before, I just think people should take a deep breath of that and we don't know those things because the soft landing in mild recession for our recession. And obviously, sure we will be the best. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just a follow-up on the upcoming Basel reforms. Two questions. You've talked about the impact of the U.S. economy like others have said the same at this point is that falling on deaf ears. And secondly, maybe, Jeremy. If you can touch upon. This structural changes that you expect to make in the capital markets business because of FRTB . Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, so on your first point. I mean, I think you can just read Vice-Chair of our speech right. He addressed that point early directly. He clearly doesn't agree as this is right. So we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that all else equal, higher capital requirements, definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy. So we'll see what happens on that. On an FRTB, it's really very nuanced, it's probably like to much detail for this call to be honest, but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example, one-product under FRTB has yield curve spread options and if the FRTB proposal goes through, as currently written, that product becomes not viable. So obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares, but it's just one example of the way, sometimes when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly, all the way down to new products and responding accordingly. You can wind-up having to change our business mix there. Obviously, more significant products that matter much more of a real economy like mortgage where, the layering on of the operational risk in the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're once again, making the product even harder to offer the homeowners, so we'll see, we'll see what happens. Jamie Dimon : And I would just add to that even though the product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. The advantage by-product, by client by effectively business mix and further adjustments. Whilst these loans don't make sense for your balance sheet as a whole, almost anyone. We just need to keep up to recognize that and we just managed through all the various complications here and you're going to the other do. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi. I had another question on Vice-Chair Bar's speech from this week. I do except the capital ratios do go up 20% for you. And perhaps others to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing, will you do business repricing or simply removing activities that used to do it. Kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic though, Apollo hit an all-time stock price high at the same week as to speech. So does that -- how much business they have JPMorgan or the industry capital ratios to go up as much as potentially proposed. Jamie Dimon : Yes. Before Jeremy answer that question, this is great news for hedge funds, private-equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackstone and the gas industries. Jeremy Barnum : Exactly. I was going to say Mike, yes to everything. So, rename, re-pricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power and higher capital requirements, mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how that sticks and how that flows into economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not las, successful then in some cases, we will have to remix that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jim points out, that probably means that those products and services we have the regulated perimeter and go into elsewhere and that's fine, as Jamey pointed out, those people are clients and I think that point was addressed also in Vice-Chair Bar speech. So, but in our traditionally, having risky activities we have a regulated perimeter has had some negative consequences. So these are all important things to consider. Mike Mayo : All right. And separate question, I appreciate the Investor Day. It gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investment may or may not pan-out. We are still watching that closely. Having said that you've just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII, between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even one dollar. Are you tempted to spend a little bit more, why not then more if you're gaining share and I'm not saying you should. I'm just wondering like, aren't you tempted to do so. You've $10 billion more revenues, you're not spending one dollar more of expenses like why not? Jamie Dimon : Mike, let me get this right, you're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough, is that right? Mike Mayo : Wait, just to be clear, it's just a part of the question I asked for two years, going back, whether or not, but. Jeremy Barnum : I appreciate the balance. Now in all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear right that our spending is through-the-cycles funding, based on through this cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight-through to the bottom-line, both fund is growing up, and by the way, when it's going down too and we've been through those moments, as you will remember. So, whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through-the-cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items flow, carried expense loading and which item don't. Mike Mayo : And then last quick follow-up. Jamie Dimon : I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So you actually set down the risk credit compliance, audit market bankers recruiter trainers -- this is it. We're a full effort right now. And we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things can change all the once and add to all at once. Mike Mayo : And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long-time. I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point, but when you just simply look at you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers. Where do you think, you're there now and where it can you still go because extrapolate this quarter you're getting closer? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, you or yourself right? You definitely can't extrapolate the current numbers, but. I think more broadly on benefiting our benchmarking ourselves too low-cost providers that sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long-time, which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed. In terms of how we respond to volumes that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing and modernization and cloud and AI and all that type of stuff that we're talking about, so. I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steve Chubak : Hi, thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook, just with signs at recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of our versus industry deposits. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second-half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as treasury issuance really begins to ramp-in earnest. Yes, good question, Steve if. So, let me say a couple things about this. So obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks, as well as obviously the public transaction, but now if you look at our kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and project forward. Our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of QTS with the system. But, noting that we do have some hope for offset by taking share, just to get a couple of examples like in consumer. We've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning. And so their share over increase their and in wholesale, we've obviously invested a lot in products and services. And so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates. And so there are potentially some share offsets there. but broadly we are core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise. Within that, you know, the same thing, we have noted that as we got through the desk fueling and the CGA build it has come into effect a lot of bill issuance. The big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves have come out of RFP. And so-far, with most of the GTA, they're on I guess the targeting 600, and they're at 550 or something almost done. Jeremy Barnum : You know more of it and some people feared has kind of RFPs. So, as you say. I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights. So the system works better when you've got ample supply of short video collateral the front-end of the yield curve. So that whole RFP TGI reserve dynamics is going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RFPs coming down. Steve Chubak : Helpful color. And just follow-up on card income revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure, maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with batch 91 versus some other factors. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, so actually that card income number Steve has a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a rewards liability adjustment this quarter kind of a technical thing. So that's just a temporary headwind and also the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item in the prior periods. So and obviously, I know you guys look better the card income is sort of thing that we look at that much ourselves. Steve Chubak : Can you size the reward liability impact? Jeremy Barnum : Why don't you get Michael to get that to you. It's not that significant, but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit lumpy. . Steve Chubak : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Just want to follow up on this pricing power conversation. Because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is, if not now when, meaning a lot has changed on the institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side -- and I would think that there'd be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on? And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material -- what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes? Thanks a lot. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. So look, on pricing power, you're right. It really depends on the product, and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks. And so it's very granular. It's very product specific. And in some cases -- we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel end game is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive. Does it put pressure on returns, all else equal that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the real economy. -- and how all of that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen. Importantly, since we don't actually have the proposal yet. So we need those details. I'm sorry, Glenn, I forgot the second half of your question. What was it? Glenn Schorr : Actually, I think you hit on it. So I'll just do a follow-up on a related -- so the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade lending activity, it may be part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price in Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside or my question is, what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system? Jeremy Barnum : I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside, but I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it purchases bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners on as a whole. So I mean, Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially, we've talked about how mortgage lending -- I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical. And in the recent past, it's actually very profitable, then it was less so like the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin margin business. It's challenging. And when you increase the Cap requirements, it makes it even harder. So that just becomes one of the areas where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago. And it might impact me in that we do less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate. Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Yes, I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability sensitive to asset sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. Betsy. I mean, as you know, -- that's always been a challenging number. It's manages a risk management measure of store, so that's also somewhat limited in that respect. And it has been an uneven usefulness in terms of potential to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we looked at that and tried to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure, if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags -- and so we've done that, and that just has the effect that I talked about, it increases the EAR number by about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would have been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion. But all the usual caveat supply, right? I mean it's never - the answer is going to hold for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to... Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today. And when I think about your forward guide here, longer term, you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four or five quarters, I should expect that, that 2.5% should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through the cycle betas and all the deposits. And so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would have been using essentially terminal deposit betas for the based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice at the beta predicts will not be instantaneous. And so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that thing. Betsy Graseck : Right. But you were saying earlier, deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII longer term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Go ahead, James. Yes. Jamie Dimon : I mean basically, yes, as you have - if the next round is going to be the beta built from 30 to 40 to 50, whatever the product is, yes, that's the latter. And the 2.5 will go down over time as that actually happens if rates actually go up. The rates don't actually go up to 2.5 billion is exactly 2.5 again. Jeremy Barnum : And what I was going to say, as is just that the projection of the 87 coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration, as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, at product level reprice. And furthermore, then obviously, the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as we move from large corporate wholesale to consumer. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Matt O'Connor: All right. Good morning. So I mean your came eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. I guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook for loan growth, and I think others is fairly sluggish at least outside of card. So I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen historically, but there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that much for deposits for the reason. So what would make you change that? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. In the end Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. Jamie Dimon : I think every bank is in a different position about what they need. And so, you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also by city. So you have different competition. Arizona and Phoenix then we have Chicago, Illinois, and we do have high interest rate products. So it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it a big bank or a small bank, and you're going to see whenever we report who kind of payable the more things and who did and things like that. So look, I would take you to give - I think it's going to say there is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. You take it as a given - there is no circumstance that we've ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products and they go through migration or a direct rate or move into CDs or money market funds. And we're going to have to compete for that. You already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts. Jeremy Barnum : Matters just that it's really just our primary bank relationships. And that's the core of the strategy. Matt O'Connor: Yes. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loan-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low. So you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time to make the decision not to pay up. I mean I assume that's a trade-off that eventually you'll. Jamie Dimon : That's a little more complicated because that - a lot of that loan to value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, et cetera. Matt O'Connor: Got it. All right. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to Charles Peabody from Fortalis Partners. You may proceed. Charles Peabody : Good morning. Jeremy, on Page 4 of your presentation, you showed some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration or I shouldn't say deteriorating depletion of some of that excess liquidity obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards '24, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event to have excess liquidity, so that's my first question is what's your plans for replenishing that liquidity? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Charles. So I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yes, when you think about half of the change in the bank LCR number is consequence to First Republic. And the rest of it is just the expected decrease in to someone deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected. And therefore, I think that the replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample of liquidity. Now if you want to project trends forward, that's a different story, but that's sort of the business of banking, we'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance ratios and quarter's balance sheet principles as you would expect from us. Jamie Dimon : And I would just add that just look at the at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities even we get down to no excess, we're going to have like I've got the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity. And the liquidity ratio is slightly some difference. I think the studies according to system and of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight in one or two. Charles Peabody : So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up. If you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII. So that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30 basis point drop in your margin - your NIM to get to that from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean what is driving - is it really the deposit? Or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates? Or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the impact? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Charlie, I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's not that complicated, right? I think we did this. I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, but we put a little chart on the page just in very simple terms, it shows like what the dollar consequences are whatever, like a 10 basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding going from 0% to 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin or whether it's because savings reprices relatively small changes in rates there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple of trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that. And that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be Charles Peabody : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. And have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum, and their Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead. Jamie Dimon : Hey, good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call. So before we get into the discussion about third-quarter earnings, I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all of our hearts here at JPMorgan Chase go out to all who are suffering. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Jamie, and, of course, I very much echo this sentiment. Now, let's turn to our first-quarter earnings results. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33, and revenue of $40.7 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 22%. These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On Page 2, we have some more detail. Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $2.2 billion of revenue, $858 million of expense, and $1.1 billion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.5 billion was up $5 billion or 15% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets, was up $4.8 billion or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Card, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR, ex-Markets, was up $374 million or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $190 million or 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion or 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth and front office and technology staffing, as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge-offs in Card, and included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by card loan growth. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III endgame proposal. In line with our capital hierarchy, we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge. And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it. So, let's cover that now, starting on Page 4. Given the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry as well as households and businesses as end-users, we thought it was important to spend time discussing it. And while we know there is interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are well-capitalized and well-positioned to deal with stress. Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and there's a lot that does not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by around 30% or $500 billion, which results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion. One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time that GSIB was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally. Since implementation, the failure to address economic growth despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse. And now all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA. Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated GSIB buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lens on the proposed increases is the introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital Buffer. Although there is limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk capital embedded in the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize for this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio. Now let's turn to Page 5, which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA-CCR and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III endgame and GSIB proposals are finalized in their current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how overcalibrated these proposals are and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the SCB. And, of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB clause, it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future. And aside from those dynamics, there remains the long-standing issue of procyclicality in the overall capital [Technical Difficulty]. We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true that the proposal is Basel compliant, Basel compliant does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III endgame consistently with how the Europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GSIB and SCB would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements. As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important broader plans about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. The current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers. In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market-making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes to the current operation of the US capital markets. We believe that well-regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets, which is vital to the US economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude. With that, let\u2019s go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre-pandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year-on-year. Cash buffers continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels with lower-income groups normalizing faster. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 19% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. We ranked number one in retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continue to solidify our leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yield-seeking flows from our consumer banking customers. In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year-on-year given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter-on-quarter, but they remain down 15% year-on-year. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year-on-year due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization [for both] (ph). And in Auto, originations were $10.2 billion, up 36% year-on-year as we saw competitors pull back and regained market share. Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $720 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card services, primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending. Next to CIB on page seven. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion and revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 6% year-on-year. IB fees were down 3% year-on-year and ranked number one with a year-to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In advisory, fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees were up 8% for debt and down 6% directly. In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half, but year-to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year-on-year against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed income was up 1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity and securitized products, as well as improved performance in credit. This was predominantly offset by currencies in emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 10%, reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior-year quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation. Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million, reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net charge-offs of $45 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 8. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20% year-on-year with payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $821 million was up 8% year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year-on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount including front-office and technology investments, as well as higher-volume related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year, 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients opt for higher-yielding alternatives. Loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations of real-estate banking as well as lower pay-off activity. Finally, credit costs were $64 million, including net charge-offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM, on Page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year-on-year as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the JPMorgan Asset Management China and Global Shares acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year-on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter-on-quarter, while deposits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client inflows. Turning to Corporate on Page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion compared to last year. NII was $2 billion, up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year-on-year. To finish, we have the outlook on Page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion, respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year, while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable. Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, which excludes legal expense. Also, remember, this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment. And on Credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balanced growth. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year, we've been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment, deposit reprice and the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. You may proceed. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you're seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration, what's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher for longer rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So as we talked a little bit about on the press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable. And we do think that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe with tiering or whatever at some point in the future. And of course, that hasn't happened yet this year. So that's one factor. In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting -- continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money in motion. And so we're seeing -- the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration, but that's sort of working as we would have hoped. And so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say. In terms of higher for longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing, both from internal migration and possibly from other effects. And at the end, as we always say, we're going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment. John McDonald : And just as a follow-up, it seems like you've done some securities repositioning in the last couple of quarters. How are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash in the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I'm sure Jamie will have something to say here, we believe in being prepared for it. And that's been our position for some time. And of course, that's produced good results, and we continue to try to position ourselves. So neither significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company. So probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side. So that can be a factor as well. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Jeremy Barnum : Hey, Steve. Steven Chubak : Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about capital market outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how you're thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection in activity? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, good question. I mean, as you know, obviously, the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed, certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing that by the time it happens, you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds, as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum, but obviously, significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds, given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side. Steven Chubak : Thanks for the color. And just for my follow-up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided, certainly a lot of helpful color on the slide. So thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time? And I was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact the SCB and CCAR. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first with the Basel III endgame proposal, from our perspective, we're currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes, some of which are what you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks. But some of them are very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes on the proposal. And so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point. I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is -- you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum. And it's therefore, in some sense, non-optimizable. So we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the level of optimization that's possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed. Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. There's what I -- sometimes I use the term costless optimization, where it's just technical fixes that don't affect revenue and don't require you to exit businesses. I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternative, which would be to do activity that's shareholder value disruptive, but it won't be costless. A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight, may no longer make sense. Now that's one that we hope will be changed but is tricky because those are very long-duration assets. So between now and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So sorry, a bit of a long answer. But then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we've got to wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the Fed's exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend to push capital higher. Steven Chubak : Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeremy Barnum : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserve release was tied to the change in the central scenario. Could you just talk to us, remind us what the central scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on credit, like, where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but in all seriousness, I think our US economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with, I think, two quarters of negative 0.5% of GDP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth, I think, around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook. So that number we\u2019ve sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So it's really not much more complicated than that. We're just kind of following the process. And I think your other question was, where am I seeing softness in credit. And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere that's not expected, meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected. And then, of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge-offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge-off number of the Commercial Bank. But the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel endgame. Maybe on the philosophical side, I think Jamie was speaking last month said, doesn't -- we don't expect any changes. But at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst-case outcome play out? Or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentiment is in Washington. It's a 1,000-page rule proposal as you know. We've got a big team of very smart people studying it very closely. Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like $1 billion of the Fed and their preamble, they forgot about $1 billion of operational risk RWA. So it just highlights that there is a possibility or seem to have forgotten. They simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees. So anyway, the point is it's long, it's complicated, it's technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes and they are going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that should be, in some sense, resolved technically. And hopefully, they'll listen. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Sorry, I'm just getting a correction in the room. I meant to say trillion. Ebrahim Poonawala : Yeah, no, I got that. I got the trillion dollars. Yep. [indiscernible] Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Ryan Kenny : Hey, good morning. I want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggests JPMorgan's overearning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalize next year or later on? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, a couple of things. So let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when it's going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rate, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day last -- earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there were some overlaps and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that kind of what does that number now look like, we think it's probably closer to about 80 with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we don't know when. But we're just trying to point out that it's a bit lower than the current run rate. Ryan Kenny : Got it. Jamie Dimon : Inside the company, some people think it will happen sooner, i.e., me. Some people think it will happen later, i.e., Jen and Marianne and Jeremy. Jeremy Barnum : There was no way that I was in that camp, actually, but I don't know. I'm not sure I have an opinion on it. Ryan Kenny : And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think about loan growth, given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we were seeing very robust loan growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization of revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still optimistic about that, but it will probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period. In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally, the supply chain situation is better. So that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted. And I think generally in wholesale, the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending on what you believe about soft landing, mild recession, no lending, we have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth, but in any case, I would expect it to be relatively muted. And of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But also, and I think this is true across the board, we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change originations, but it will change what we retain. Ryan Kenny : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. You may proceed. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Barnum : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTC number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer and Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit, we get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all these other non-bank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE, even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business profitability at such high levels? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah, Gerard, I'd say a couple of things there. So first, it's not just credit, it's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all the reasons that we've talked about. But I would also point out, sometimes we don't like the word overearning because right now, customers are happy, and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to compete effectively really comes back to a decade, two-decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise, which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there, the fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment means that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments, you and Jamie, about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, are around 28% of total deposits, which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the noninterest-bearing deposits going to interest-bearing or is it just the repricing of interest-bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number? Jeremy Barnum : That\u2019s a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure. I get your question. It's a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing split is the best one to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between wholesale and retail, we've got some amount of noninterest-bearing in wholesale that's sort of the ECR product, and so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low rate paid across checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then, of course, even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings, to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and wholesale. And then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product-level reprice that may or may not happen at the moment in the future. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. You may proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you. Again, sort of maybe re-asking the question a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run-rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher for longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you've been asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do you think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is those -- I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex-Markets. And we're kind of saying that\u2026 Jamie Dimon : It was [$2.5 billion] (ph). Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's not what I meant to say. Jamie Dimon : She said $22.9 billion. Jeremy Barnum : I didn't hear that. Okay. Anyway, so call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion. So that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume is a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother. So when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product-level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it will be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now. And we think we can manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise. And we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships, and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle. We're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us. Jamie Dimon : And I would just say quantitative tightening there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect where wholesale, consumer -- remember also the Fed has the RRP program, which is also sucking money into the Fed directly reducing deposits. That's still [$1 trillion, too] (ph). Erika Najarian : Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly complex. And I completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward-looking. I guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that, I understand that we're in the public advocacy process. I hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital markets. But for JPMorgan, has this changed your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14% when you were at Barclays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for your -- for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, this Basel III endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple of pieces in there. So let me take the most important piece first, which is the 17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III endgame proposal? So short answer is we're not going to change that number today. But when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, it's not -- you have to start by acknowledging that, that is a major headwind to returns. In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right? We have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator, denominator here. Okay. So say the numerator doesn't change, if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital, that's a significantly lower return number. I would say that, that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III endgame for a couple of reasons. One is we are hoping for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And that will be different in consumer and in wholesale. Some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level. But that hopefully can mitigate some of it. But of course, the flip side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy, and that's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit more pessimistic about those, but we surprised ourselves on those points in the past. So we'll see. And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things, and we may exit things. But I wouldn't necessarily assume that, that's going to do a lot to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting things that are shareholder disruptive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what I mean. So that's that. And then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation, and I think it's just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long-term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always says, JPMorgan is going to be fine. And we're building a lot of capital, and we were managing capital conservatively. And we'll be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve on time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do. But that doesn't really have any particular bearing on the question of what the long-term return target is or the impact on the real economy. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things of what's going on in the world and the potential impact on markets, on crude market, global trade, everything that you mentioned. And sadly, agree about the most dangerous time in decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what -- obviously, what you wrote, what are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times? Jamie Dimon : Yes. Go ahead, Jeremy. Do you want to start? Jeremy Barnum : Okay. So I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momentum. I do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were. But obviously, markets have been bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming on off a very low base. And so there's a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture, at least currently, looks solid. The sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution. Jamie Dimon : So I would add caution. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system. And you can't look at -- and of course, it can drive markets and sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but it can't stay like this forever. Between Q2, if you've never had, and how much the fiscal stimulus is going to continue at this rate before you have kind of [indiscernible] kind of factors. So I just -- I think you have to be very cautious. And of course, the dealer policies, I think, is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prepare the company for that? We do 100 stress tests a week. And we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems or interest rate problems. But usually, geopolitics presents itself as usually as a deep recession or a mild recession, a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot. And because markets do well is not a reason ever to say they're going to continue to do well. If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection points. I just -- but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious [what you\u2019re] (ph) facing. And like I said, the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out with better products and better services, securely, safely and all those things. And that's the ultimate goal. We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise as there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're coming and where they're coming from, but we keep on serving clients, doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point. But we'll deal with that, too, when we figure out what to do. Glenn Schorr : Thank you for all that. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic asset sensitivity, TD strategy, money in motion. And I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers. Do you have more digital banking customers and branch customers now? If you can just refresh that? And then a more general question, I guess, the first one for Jeremy, and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend? If you can kind of mark to market your thoughts there as it relates to AI as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender of the banking industry? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple of weeks ago. And it's interesting to note the sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point about... Jamie Dimon : The percent who are digital-only is much lower than that. Jeremy Barnum : For sure, for sure, which actually links to the broader point that what -- in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic, through the cycle, multi-channel, fully engaged customer strategy, which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment, but that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess, your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory right? I mean, we're big and very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive. And everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything. Jamie Dimon : And just the competition, we look at it as, it\u2019s Wells. It was coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously [Marcus, it's Apple. It's Chime, it's Dave] (ph). There\u2019s a lot of people coming up with these businesses in different ways. Some have been quite successful, like Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company. Mike Mayo : As it relates to AI specifically, which is the talk of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now? Or is this simply a moonshot? Jamie Dimon : Well, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model, that's public data. It's looking at everything in the Internet or everything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who is running at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. And there are multiple types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team is getting better and better and say, how can we use data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co-pilots. They know why even the clients calling us something like that. And so we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of course. That\u2019s always been true with technology and -- but we'll be quite good at it. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, I think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you stand on that? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. No, because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference, we said I think the consensus was $88 billion, but we're still going through budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark, but I would say at the margin, there's going to be a little bit of upward... Jamie Dimon : First Republic too, or no? Jeremy Barnum : This is all now including First Republic. And I think there'll be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we're going to invest prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressure on the margin. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. You may proceed. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting, not only of operational risk, but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearly double counting and market risk in the trading book. Is there any receptivity? Jamie Dimon : Can I just answer real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one-sided conversation generally. They say put in your comments. So everyone's going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from Jeremy, and we don't really know. We don't really know what's going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis, I think that\u2019s required to do it exactly right. So we'll see. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential impact on liquidity in the Markets business, specifically, is that a JPM pulling out of certain business type of event? Or is that -- is it more a comment that there'll be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit? And maybe that's all else equal, a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller business? Jamie Dimon : I think -- so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think, 60% increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do that by product, for some products it worth it than for others. But generally, it's bad across all products. And market make -- but the really important thing is market making is a critical function. And if you look at the world, only so many large market makers who can make markets for governments, hospitals, cities, schools, states, IMF, World Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone and all those various things to buy and sell for their clients in size, and market makers have a different function than hedge funds. And I don't know what the real intent was with this, this is another one, I think, needs to be really thought through. What are you trying to accomplish? We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market [shock] (ph) or something like that. But the other thing about market making, I do agree it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions, which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so much, there may be consolidation in unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints for the LCR, SLR, capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations on what you can do. Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct as what I would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller-scale players to exit, and that's a share gain opportunity for us. But I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale. Getting bigger, especially in Markets, it's quite expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective. And so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides, which is one of the reasons why we're sort of highlighting that it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything that's happened in Markets over the last 15 years is a fundamentally very different system. And well, obviously... Jamie Dimon : Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity. Like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with 30% less capital. That is a big difference in that kind of business. Jim Mitchell : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question, but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income, fees might help. But the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple of few years. So I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control in the next few years? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework, but in some fundamental sense, we just don't agree with the framework, in the sense that -- and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you see these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while, of course, there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term, directly sensitive to the revenue environment, and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes. But other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle, but they're long-term plays. And you really shouldn't expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower cost in response to a lower revenue environment, where we didn't balloon the cost when the revenue became, as we've argued, unsustainably high. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Fair enough. And then if I could just squeeze in on First Republic. Obviously, the contribution there is coming in at multiples higher than expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of -- I think there's probably some runoff of loans still to come, but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there? Jeremy Barnum : Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable, the net income, the First Republic-related net income that we printed this quarter. So the first thing to say is that we don't think that, that First Republic-related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we just talked about, in particular, overearning on deposits or sort of above-normal deposit margins also apply to First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize. And probably more significantly, as I think you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull-to-par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition. And so that's a short-term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters. And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus. And I think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think, as I said, I think, on the press call, things are going well, arguably a little bit better than we had sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. Jamie Dimon : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation, please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic, where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense, and $647 million of net income. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII, ex-Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR, ex-Markets was up $139 million or 1% and Markets revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, and a net reserve build for $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single-name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real-estate valuations in the Commercial Banking. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and revenue of $162 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, AOCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits, with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers, advisors, and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued normalization in card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. And advisory fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior year quarter with debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but announced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products business, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by fee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $924 million was up 32% year-on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client balances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remained cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. Finally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income, and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 million year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million compared to the net loss of $115 million, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset sensitive, and therefore the lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted. It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex-Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full-year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook, compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly lower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE that is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we remain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains laser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium-term outlook that you've put out there? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over-earning. So not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full-year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you bought back a couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks, given the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, good question. I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on organic capital generation. So the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest base of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also, just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So that's another factor that we need to keep in mind. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. You may proceed. John McDonald : Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So the weighted average unemployment rate in the numbers still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers. And our skew remains, as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside, just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew, and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central outlook, which I think is something like 4.6% peak of the current levels. John McDonald : Okay. And then just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts, what's the impact of a few Fed cuts, and how much does it matter for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Yes. Happy to do that, John. So I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q, but on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So just round numbers, about $2 billion in EAR. I think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that, just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger, but just crudely, I think, as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up in a different way on the NII question. Just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then layering in, if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth and deposits? How are you thinking about all that? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs. But maybe a little non-intuitive, if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with change in rates and change in rate pay, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then in terms of balances. Yes, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider that QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues, and that long growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So I kind of agree with you that this environment is, at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next, we'll go to line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. I guess maybe one question, looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying, as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear. I'm not sure if Jamie's on the call, but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased. Is the market pricing incorrectly, or when you look at your customer base, are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes? Jeremy Barnum : Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So whether you believe it or not is a separate issue. But I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that means that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling, obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios is a very strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means all else equal, strong consumer credit. So that's how we see the world. Ebrahim Poonawala : And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filtered into multifamily apartments. You all have a pretty large multifamily exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of one, are you seeing any bleed-through of what we've seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So good question on the multifamily. And the short answer is that for us, it's pretty uncontroversially, no bleed-through. And the reason is that while there is, we do - we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in. So it's higher-end stuff in much less supply-constrained markets that is under more pressure. And as you know, our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable, supply-constrained markets. And so the performance there remains really very robust. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. Your - on a net basis, net to RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of RWA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for B3 finalization, which seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in the June DFAST results, you mentioned the SCB sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium-term? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Erika, it's a good question, and I understand what you're asking - why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision-making under uncertainty, and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors. But all the ingredients that you've listed are the right ingredients, right? Very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities. So I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with a modest pace for now, but obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime, and we may well do that. Erika Najarian : Thanks. And just as a follow-up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for '24? Jeremy Barnum : A little bit of that is in there. Yes. So you would see that we often talk about the volume and revenue-related category, and I think in my prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked about $1 billion increase in that category year-on-year as a result of an improved NIR outlook. So the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet, and our share of that is part of that. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi. You're guiding to $90 billion of expenses. That's up $7 billion year-over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give some color on that. I know we've been through this before, two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So if you could just upfront give us visibility. How much of that is due to incentive pay? How much is that due to tech? How much is that due to AI? And what are the expected returns to get from that $7 billion pickup? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And - yes, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase year-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much longer-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts, we had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an improved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want to say for the avoidance of doubt, that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company, both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say, actually, in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here. Mike Mayo : Okay. I have a short follow-up. I'm still here. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Mike Mayo : Yes. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I asked you this before, and you said you're spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much should AI make a difference? Just a little bit more meat on the tech bones. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff, and I'll save that for Investor Day, if you don't mind. But I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenrether now running the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization. So I think that - I think of this as being a little bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves, in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an extremely disciplined way. It's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained, well-chosen list of high-impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way that's extremely pragmatic and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jeremy. How are you? Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming. Can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker, or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many rate cuts? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for our outlook, and that's what's in there. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook, you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organization? And second, are you surprised that it hasn't - QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus, and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT all else equal is withdrawing from system-wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset helpfully by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so that's been supportive of system-wide deposits. As we go into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know, that there's - the market's expectation is that the QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So - and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from RRP. So that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in system-wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But also I think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you're starting the year with a healthy pipeline. Can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in - how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So if you go into the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps higher, and the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there have been some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post-launch performance or whatever. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So I would expect to see rebound there. In DCM, again, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change. So sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates. So that can go both ways. And then M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple of nuances there. One, as you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year, and so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in 2024 all else equal. And of course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we're seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and I would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive. Manan Gosalia : Great. And on the flip side, in C&I you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for that to rebound? Do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down, or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think, as you say, it's a little bit of a - I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that driver revolver utilization. I think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the C suites, which increases as the companies get smaller in size. So there's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be I would think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapEx and so on, and so you might see utilization even lower. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. So I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending, but now you're starting to see more in asset-backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So my question to you is, how big of a trend is this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is, this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So it is a meaningful shift in the environment. It's something that we've been watching for some time. We've made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses, but also go head to head with the private credit providers and these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what the client actually wants. It tends to be a trade-off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution. And we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long-time DCM franchise. So that's been a priority. And we're actually already starting to see some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB, with certain client segments. And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with them. They're also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit. Glenn Schorr : Anything specific on asset back? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending has? Jeremy Barnum : It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn, so we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Cool. Thank you for that. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Charles Peabody from Portales Partners. You may proceed. Charles Peabody : Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming because you'll have a full year in '24 First Republic, that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or - I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Charlie. So one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period on period comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so we really focused on having our guidance be firm-wide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math, but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR for my response to the prior question, because that EAR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. And so I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company. Charles Peabody : Just to make sure I understood what you're saying. So you have NII ex-Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well, or up? Jamie Dimon : It was kind of head-matched the day we did it, so. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of - that pulled to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juice the 2023 number a little bit. So therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then you just get into the questions about the FTP and the funding and whatever, and then it's just like too complicated. So I'd rather not go there. Charles Peabody : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we do have no further questions at this time. Jeremy Barnum : Okay. Thanks very much, everyone. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $42.5 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a couple of highlights. Firm-wide IB fees were up 18% year-on-year, reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees. And we have seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB and Wealth Management business. On Page 2, we have some more detail. This is the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic, given that going forward, First Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year-on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic contributed $1.7 billion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income. Now focusing on the firm-wide results excluding First Republic. Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $736 million or 4% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in card, largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex Markets was up $1.2 billion or 12% driven by higher firm-wide asset management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year. Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release of $38 million. Net charge-offs were up $116 million predominantly driven by Card. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal effects, including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower Card loans. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. Consumers remain financially healthy, supported by a resilient labor market. While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances were still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation. When looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year. Turning now to the financial results excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year-on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with average balances down 7% as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue. Originations, while still modest, were up 10%. Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained healthy margins and market share. Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year-on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge-offs, which were up $825 million year-on-year predominantly due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflecting the build in Card largely offset by a release in Home Lending. Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will be -- we will report earnings for the CIB and CB as standalone segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8-K with historical results, including 5 quarters and 2 full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line with the reorganization that was announced in January. Turning back to this quarter. CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $2 billion was up 27% year-on-year. IB fees were up 21% year-on-year, and we ranked #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 21% driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up 58% and equity up 51%. In terms of the outlook. While we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue, and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit-related client credits were largely offset by higher fee-based revenue and deposit balances. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year. Fixed income was down 7% driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prior year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $7.2 billion were down 4% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower legal expense. Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher noninterest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year-on-year with increased IB fees, largely offset by lower Markets revenue compared to a strong prior year quarter. Payments revenue of $1.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth, net of higher deposit-related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expenses. Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1%, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and sales activity. Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge-offs of $66 million. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5% driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation; continued growth in our private banking advisor teams; and the impact of the JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition; as well as higher distribution fees. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $34 billion, led by equities and fixed income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were flat. Turning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year-on-year driven by the impact of the balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million. The current quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year-on-year predominantly driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 9. We now expect NII ex Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that contained 3 rate cuts at quarter end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue-neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%. Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter, and it will likely stay around 23% this year, absent discrete items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments. Our managed rate is unchanged, and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller gap than we've previously observed, and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward, although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past. For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income. We're just mentioning this to help with your models. So to wrap up. We're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent, and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A. Operator : The first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So a couple of questions here. Just one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that? And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know it's -- we have to wait for Basel III endgame reproposal to come through and all that. But are we -- should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15% CET1 until we know all these rules? James Dimon : Yes. So Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. I'm thrilled to have you on this call. For those who don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode. And to remind all of us how lucky we are to be here, but Betsy in particular, the amount of respect we have, not just in your work, but in your character over the last 20-plus years have been exceptional. So on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back. I'm thrilled to have you here. And so you're asking a pertinent question. So we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we increased the dividend. And if you ask me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like 1/3 of normalized earnings. Of course, it's hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit behind that sometimes. If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera. I think the far more important question is the 15%. So look at the 15%, I'm going to oversimplify it. That basically will prepare us for the total Basel endgame today roughly. The specifics don't matter that much. Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run. But -- and it looks like Basel III endgame may not be the worst case, it will be something less than that. So obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say on the order of $20 billion or something like that. And yes, we're -- we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business first. And we pay the dividend, the steady dividend. Build the business. And if we think it's appropriate, to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year. I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about the world and things like that. So waiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully, we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific with you all. But in the meantime, there's also -- it's very important to put in mind, there are short-term uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our CET1, too. So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital -- that are using up that capital. Jeremy mentioned on the -- on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading, we could do things now. So it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store. We will deploy it in a very good way for our shareholders in due course. Jeremy Barnum : Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well. And just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks, the trajectory. It's $2 billion a quarter. James Dimon : I'm sorry, $2 billion a quarter. Jeremy Barnum : Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you so much, and I appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20. Jeremy Barnum : Excellent. Us too. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, a good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that we're seeing. I'm aware that there's a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash-sorting? We've looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think it makes sense to assume they're in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively 0 and the policy rate is above 5%, that you're not going to see ongoing migration. And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where -- even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield-seeking behavior. So it's quite conceivable. And this is actually on the yield curve that we had in the fourth quarter that had 6 cuts in it, we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So I would say no meaningful change in the trends, and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there. James Mitchell : Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly 3 cuts in it. So it's the current yield curve. It's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth, which, while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down. So that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then there's obviously the wildcard of potential product-level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace. And you know this, obviously. But in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively 0, relatively small changes in the product-level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So the error bands here are pretty wide. And we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long-term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that The Street might need to build in more reserve growth for the Card growth. You've had more reserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, John. So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth. Obviously, there's the wildcard of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the SKU and the CECL distribution and so on. And we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So if you guys have your own opinions about that, that's fine. But we're narrowly just saying that, based on the card loan growth, that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do expect build in the back half of the year. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion, but revenue-neutral. I guess the obvious thing is there, there's typically an offset in fee income, and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be, the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? Jeremy Barnum : That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop of the Markets balance sheet in the supplement, and these things are all related. So fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold equities on the balance sheet, non-interest bearing, high funding expense, negative for NII; or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So that shifts as a function of the sort of borrower relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing. Operator : Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just in terms of, Jamie, when you think about the outlook for the economy, would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher for longer, maybe the economy is too strong so don't get any rate cuts. Are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers, where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks Jamie's pointed out, but I'm just getting -- trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers. James Dimon : So I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home price dropped, stock price dropped. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money. They're still spending it. So whatever happens, the customer's in pretty good shape. And they're -- if you go into a recession, they'd be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books drop, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year, look at 2 years or 3 years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So we're in good -- we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in '72, it was true in any time you've had it. So I'm just on the more cautious side that how people feel, the confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, one thing you projected today based on what -- not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed. But these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen? Like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera, then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of that happen is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict a big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate, both for JP and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerabilities and issues beyond office CRE? How would you characterize the health of the CRE market? James Dimon : Yes. So I'll put it into 2 buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think the multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want. But if you think of real estate, there's 2 pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve, the whole yield curve, not Fed funds, but the 10-year bond rate, it goes up 2%. All assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well obviously, that creates a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. But it's not just true for real estate, it's true for everybody. And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect. The second thing is the why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and filling things out. And other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well, that's the worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies. You are going to have more companies cutting back. You are going to have less leases. It will affect -- including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that people haven't really experienced since 2010. So I'd just put in the back of your mind, the why is important, the interest rates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone -- the real estate will muddle through. Obviously, it'd be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all that, but people will muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tougher on a lot of folks, and not just real estate, if in fact that happens. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. L. Erika Penala : Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III endgame as written. You earn 22% on -- without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, 6 weeks from now or 5 weeks from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you overearning today? Jeremy Barnum : Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also heard Jamie say that we're overearning in credit. I mean, wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have built for that. So in the current run rate, a bit less clear, the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized, essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital and so on. And you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day. So we might not have that much more to say, except to reiterate what I've said in the past, which is that whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize. We will seek to reprice. We will adjust in various ways as to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule, as proposed at least, there -- a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so in the base case, you have to think of it as a headwind. L. Erika Penala : Got it. And just as a follow-up question. You mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter? That it seems like the market down-pricing; and obviously no June cut; no September cut; and a toss-up in December, which shouldn't matter for this year. As we think about that $90 billion, does the -- if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much? Given that it seems like June is the only one that... Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII. So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, like be my guest. Looks like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you, of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically 0, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors, we've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions. And it's going to be what it's going to be. James Dimon : Which we know are going to be wrong. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about -- we will have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline to continue to move along. We obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that? You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with -- when it relates to M&A on like go, no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then what are you thinking we need to have to kick start just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Yes. Let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. And I think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. Dialogue is quite good. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve-out type things. So dialogue is good. Valuation environment is better, like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM, there's always a pipeline dynamic, and conditions were particularly good this quarter. And so we caution a little bit there about pull-forward, which is even more acute, I think, on the DCM side, given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter. So that's a factor. And then the question of M&A, I think, is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A but also because of its knock-on impact on DCM through acquisition financing and so on. And there's the well-known kind of regulatory headwinds there, and that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't know. I've heard some narratives that maybe there's like some pent-up deal demand. Who knows how important politics are in all this. So I don't know. We're fundamentally, as I said I think on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter, happy to see momentum in announced M&A. Little bit cautious about the pull-forward dynamic, a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. And I guess I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets. And not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just maybe just talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're positioning portfolios? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period. And while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, oh, is this sustainable? Might there be downside here? For now, that does seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower 0 bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates, that not only affects the rates business, but it affects the foreign exchange business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting. And so all of that creates risk management needs, and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth. So I think that those are some of the themes on the Markets side at the margin. And yes, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally, I would say. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see you put a lot of effort into that and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, it's not weeks or months, I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U.S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking, Consumer or Wholesale Payments. So I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words. And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that business in particular doing? Jeremy Barnum : Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to note that the U.S. is not isolated from that, right? If we have global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that's not only a problem outside the U.S. That affects the global economy and therefore the U.S. and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera. So -- and in that context, keeping in mind what we always say, that we invest through the cycle, that we sort of go -- we don't go into countries and then leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges. We manage risks. We do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment. But broadly, the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had, which is its sort of global character because of a particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how we've always operated. And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. It's -- we're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yes, I'm sure we'll give you more color and other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see. Michael Mayo : Just as a follow-up to that, then. Why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes, everything else, why is Wholesale Payments doing great? Jeremy Barnum : Well, I think one of the things about payments businesses is that, in some sense, they're -- I mean, recession-proof is probably the wrong word. And in any case, we're not dealing with a recession, but we're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world. And that's a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what. So that's one piece. But I think the other piece is that our willingness to invest, which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in this business right now. And so we are seeing the benefits of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term and this year. I have a bigger-picture question in terms of you're so good in spelling out where you're overearning. Do you feel like you're underearning on the Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, look, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yes the wallet is like 20% plus below the 10-year average. So is that -- is there just a bigger upside, and it's just a matter of when, not if? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're underearning in Investment Banking now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, at this point, it was like March 2020, right, it was the beginning of the pandemic. So it's like 4 years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to grow with that. So I do think there's meaningful upside in the Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds, I think, particularly in M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment. So you could see some mean reversion there. And yes, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients. We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share. Glenn Schorr : Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision an environment -- or maybe I should rephrase that. What type of environment would have JPMorgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one. Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. And it's a little bit hard to see it. And in our world, where we're guiding to, I guess now with the special assessment added, $91 billion of expenses, it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that are being generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA in the company. That does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency. And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions? And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So if you talk about like a normal recession with visibility on the cycle, would we change our long-term strategic investment plans, which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective, assuming resilience through the cycle? No, we wouldn't. Could there be some environments that, for whatever reason, change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through-the-cycle analysis has changed for some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we did see the trading assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter. But maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept that's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons, you have the ability, at least in theory, to deploy portions of that with kind of like -- into relatively short-duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason in what might be thought of as a tactical sense. So he's just pointing out that, that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RWA is a reflection of that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to a change in revenue. There's just too many moving parts there. But for sure, one thing that's true is that higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to a higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G-SIB capacity utilization, et cetera, in the Markets business. And we don't just chase revenue. We go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to do it, and we will. So we still are operating under multiple binding constraints, and obviously, the environment is complex. So the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capital position, which is in no small part in anticipation of all of the uncertainty. But it does also mean that, if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities. Matthew O'Connor: Got it. And then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes are up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any trends within that, that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category -- either overall or among certain segments? Jeremy Barnum : Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I would say. You can look at it a lot of different ways, inflation cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture. There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary. And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the -- while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest-income cohorts, within that, there's obviously a probability of distribution, and there's some -- or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some such people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore struggling a little bit, unfortunately. And what you observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared, which is sort of aggressive levering up. So I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the read-across is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets. And that's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course, Jamie talked about it in the shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share -- or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well. Jeremy Barnum : Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is that they're exceptionally tight. So I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days. But broadly throughout the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, where losses in OCI that we would have had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio. So broadly sort of in keeping with the big run-up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening that -- in secondary markets. That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool. And you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms, which always makes us a little bit concerned. And as we have in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromise on structure there. So you are seeing a little bit of that. I think that away from the leveraged lending space, in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending, we were seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived the last few weeks, and it's always a little bit hard to observe in any case. But I would say broadly the dynamics or the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive, and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot. Gerard Cassidy : And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer. We've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there as both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan, how you balance the 2 out? Where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like, but at the same time, you're supporting their business. Jeremy Barnum : Right. Yes. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit, private equity community, now you're talking about different parts of the capital structure. But we do recognize that, that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas. And that's part of the franchise, and it's all good at some level. But narrowly on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. So I would say for us, the strategy there is very much to be product-agnostic, actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? What does it take to be good at this stuff? And what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silos. So you have -- you need underwriting skills, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this is what we do, and we're really good at it. And increasingly, what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, it starts to make sense to actually bring in some co-lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk. And so in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. At the same time, the syndicated lending space, being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution, other aspects of how that business works. So we're watching it. The competitive dynamics are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none. And so we're looking forward to the future here. Operator : Our last question comes from Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a home run, and I'm glad to see that Jamie Dimon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, above the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. Now I know you don't want to extrapolate that. But can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that? Because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million, down from $900 million. And then secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less, and that's why you don't want to extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So that's my first question. Jeremy Barnum : Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns on not giving too much First Republic-specific guidance. But I do think that kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So let me go through the pieces. So yes, the current quarter's results annualize to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount accretion, which was very front-loaded as a result of short-dated assets. So that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective, you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect. There was maybe an embedded question then there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real, the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well, but we're not done yet, and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectation for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons. One is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumed that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your point, quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher. And that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers. It's probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal, including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So yes, I think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie. Charles Peabody : As a quick follow-up, where are the next home runs going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan. But there's probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buying of NYCB is clearly to create a platform for roll-ups of failed banks. And then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks. So where -- do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So that's my question. Jeremy Barnum : Right. Okay, Charlie, there's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures. Like you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I guess let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question. Like as we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store. And right now, we don't see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise, despite the uncertainty about the Basel III endgame, we will be well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards different types of bidders. And obviously, there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth. And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal, for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess that's probably as much as I have on that. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you and good morning everyone. Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up 10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of First Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net investment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally the firm announced that the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment Bank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share of 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up $626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding foundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Barnum : Good morning Steve. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus a 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward? Jeremy Barnum : Right, okay. Thanks Steve. And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17% through cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference. So maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patients. So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else. Steven Chubak : No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII. You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating. Do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over earning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest completion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So we'll see how it goes. And in the end, we are kind of focused on just running the place, recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of over earning, whatever it is. Steven Chubak : Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Steve. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted, obviously, that you think there is an error in the Fed\u2019s calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed looks like? Is there a process to modify the SCB higher? And if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed. Not to confirm or deny that they even exist, that stuff is private. And so -- and then if you talk about like the timing here, right? So you know that the stress capital buffer that's been released 3.3%, is a preliminary number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31, it may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation, we haven't used that word. What we know -- what we believe, rather, is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed\u2019s disclosed results looked non-intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer. Whether the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens. I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma SCB, whatever it might conceivably be, you actually see once again, quite a bit of volatility in the year-on-year change in the stress capital buffer for many firms. And just sort of reiterating and -- another example of what we've said a lot over the years, that it's volatile, it's untransparent, it makes it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do things. So I'll leave it at that. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question. I think you highlighted in response as a matter of when not if. And obviously, Jamie is not there. You can't speak for Jamie. But seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts on your special dividend? And can you do other things like for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout sort of a step function increase, where -- keep that flat and grow into that grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean I would direct you to read -- actually, I have Jamie's comments at the industry conference where you participated the week after Investor Day, because he wanted just a good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points. And I think his comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really a preference. We hear from people that many of our investors wouldn't find that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our first choice. So I think the larger point is just that -- a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit, and they're really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy. So first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then the dividend, I think, we are always going to want to keep it in that like sustainable, and also sustainable in a stress environment. So that continues to be the way we think about that. And then at the end of it, it is buybacks. And Jamie has been on the record for over a decade, I think over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation, and price is a factor. So that's sort of the totality of the sort of options, I guess. Saul Martinez : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Saul. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, up sequentially and 50% year-over-year. And I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space. And we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through, because DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential. And just where the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean we are happy to see the progress. People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some time, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of dialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So on the DCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we are reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance. So the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large industries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted performance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so in some cases, people looking at IPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still have concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you for all that Jeremy. And just one on the consumer side. Just anything you're noticing in terms of people who just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Any -- is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge-offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still -- it's normalization, not deterioration. It's in-line with expectations. As I say, we always look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you look in there, specifically, for example on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lower income segments, where you see a little bit of rotation of the spend out of discretionary into non-discretionary. But the effects are really quite subtle, and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that we are seeing, which, while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions, say, like they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seeing moderating GDP growth. And so it is not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So it all kind of hangs together in what is sometimes actually not a very interesting story. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Ken. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct-lending component. So I'm curious if you are showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance side, because that's a bigger part of the world, and it is a bigger part of your business? So I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a little bit to my prior comment, in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing kind of like not that many deals. So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into the private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases. Which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak. And then on asset-backed financing, you actually asked me that question before. And at the time, my answer was that I haven't heard much about that trend, and that continues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So I can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it. Glenn Schorr : That's great for you if you are not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on -- you were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you are being patient and rates are high. And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration? Jeremy Barnum : Right. I mean on duration, in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So that's one thing to say, that was more last quarter than this quarter. But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet, and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So clearly, it is true that empirically, we've behaved like very asset sensitively in this rate hiking cycle, and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near-term. But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple of times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're walking in 5.5% rate. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front in mind for us. Glenn Schorr : Super, helpful. Thanks so much for that. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Glenn. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to over-[earning NII] (ph). And I guess the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs? Or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build yourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items. And so if you do that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%. So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of the expected higher deposit costs. That's -- we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part, the normalization of NII. And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors. Matt O'Connor: Yes. That was a really helpful chart. Just one follow-up. On the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that? Because right now, the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still leaving any impact of that. But kind of longer-term, you'd expect a little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what does you mean by that? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean you and I talked about this before. I guess I sort of -- I guess I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forwards is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like I mean people have different views about the so-called term premium. And obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw, when rates were at Zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of -- many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM and extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives. So there are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point. Matt O'Connor: Got it. Okay, thank you for the details. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Matt. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit cost going higher. Anything I'm missing on that list? And what would cause you to end the over earning narrative? Jeremy Barnum : No. Actually, I think that is the right list Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end to be over earning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean to the extent that, that is the through-the-cycle number that we believe and that we are currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that or the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over earning narrative. Mike Mayo : You're 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assumed for that? Jeremy Barnum : I mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger. And the small part as a function of the volatility of those pools, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more of the dollars. And at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands, and obviously things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers, but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%. Which is why at Investor Day, when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III endgame. Mike Mayo : Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean when I asked Jamie at the [2013] (ph) Investor Day would it make sense to have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling you take a hike, right? And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I mean at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time? Or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked about this a lot and Jamie has talked about this a lot, it is a very, very, very competitive market. And we are very happy with our performance. We are very happy with the share we've taken. And 17% is like an amazing number actually. And like to be able to do that, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non-banks, from US banks, from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So the number has a range around it, obviously. So it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee and it can fluctuate. But we are very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it, again assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and [line] (ph) segments. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it is related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right and the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean I understand it is a function of okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings? Or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are right? So I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities. So -- in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize that not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief. And so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just going to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So generally speaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say. Obviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before about this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked about the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made, that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's what we did this quarter. So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher. And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks. And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever, when we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the levels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It's just that we don't feel now is the right time. Betsy Graseck : Great. Thank you Jeremy. Appreciate it. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Betsy. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jeremy, how are you? Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the non-interest bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period end, the period end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it in the wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business. And some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But yes I'll leave it at that, I guess. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels. And we all know about the commercial real estate office, and you always talk about over-earning on net interest income of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment. And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any signs of cracks or anything? And again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's a good question. I think the short answer is no, we are not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we are seeing 10 years was something like literally zero. So that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number, I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across bankers and the risk team, that's not -- we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So I don't think, that anything in the current quarter results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say. Gerard Cassidy : Great, appreciate the insights as always. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Gerard. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just had one cleanup question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Happy to clarify that. So Jamie's comments were that the allowance to build and the Card allowance, so we are talking about Card specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher, but it is in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year, last time I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So who knows what it will actually wind up being, but that remains our view. One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that 12%, as well as seasoning of earlier vintages, which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Erika. Operator : And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year-over-year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that? And then secondly outside of Cards, loan demand has been quite weak. And any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Jim. Good question. So yes, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type stuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability the supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally. And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in terms of being patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was referring to. Jim Mitchell : All right. Okay, great. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks Jim. Operator : And we have no further questions. Jeremy Barnum : Very good. Thank you, everyone. See you next quarter. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and markets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows. Now turning to page two for the firm wide results. The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was up $274 million or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page four. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In home lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million year-on-year and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances. Next the Commercial and Investment Bank on page five. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and we ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities was up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late quarter activity in Asia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year-on-year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue related compensation, and growth in-place, as well as higher technology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client segments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near-term as originations are offset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page six. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72 billion, led by fixed income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on page seven. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page eight. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues. But we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full-year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex-markets, about 6%. So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for \u201825? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together, the best of my ability. So as we sit here today, the biggest single driver is of the sequential declines is in fact, that we're expecting, is in fact the yield curve. So that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the starting the cutting cycle. It feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield seeking behavior, that has come down quite a bit. So that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix, where with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as you move to wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there. And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So maybe I'll, well I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter. And as you may recall at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happened. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes, obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines at NII ex-markets. But the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, card revolve growth, and other factors can return us to sequential growth. Obviously, we're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you, you know, a bit of a framework to work with. Jim Mitchell : All right. Thanks a lot. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Jeremy. Hi, how are you? So I did want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that contentious expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion. So a pretty healthy step up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year? Jeremy Barnum : Sure. So, good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items, and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion, and for next year it was $90 billion. So that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. And it was because we thought that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So I'm happy to expand more on that. But anyway, to expenses, yes, so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, you know, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against, so that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers, because of the seasonality of incentive comp, but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so there's some manualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed. Like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously we're in the third quarter now and not the fourth quarter. In the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on the NII. Jamie Dimon : And can you just give you a view of expense a little bit? You call expenses very often. I call investments. And if you actually go back to investor day, that you'll see that we're adding private bankers in asset wealth management. We're adding ETF in asset wealth management. We're adding private bankers in international private banking. We're growing chase wealth management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively, you know, the cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit. And I would put that as a category that's going to generate great stuff over time. Steven Chubak : No, thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the corridor. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment? I know that you've had some aversion to that in the past, but do you anticipate redeploying additional access liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all SQL, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards, right? So point one. Point two, I think the curve remains inverted and so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII. Like, that's not, that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience, it's quite different from the situation that you have with the numbers. Jamie Dimon : More than 6%. So like\u2026 Jeremy Barnum : Yes. Now, so when we think about the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple of things to say. So obviously a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EAR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from 2.8 to about 2.1 if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to expand as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But, you know, for now, we're comfortable with where we are. Jamie Dimon : And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months. Steven Chubak : Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. You may proceed. Erika Najarian : My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone's trying to figure out the over-under for net interest income next year? So maybe a two-part first question. The second being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in \u201825, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like, right? I mean, it's gyrated so much. And so, as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end, but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve? Jeremy Barnum : Right, okay. You threw a curveball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex-markets to be currently at 87%, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now, that consists of, I already mentioned previously, that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year. So you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate. You've got some sequential declines. You've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full-year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolves, resumed in the back half of the year, both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve over that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought I mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year, but still a tailwind. You know obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Now\u2026 Jamie Dimon : Could I just say some -- next time, we should give you the number. I don't want to spend all time in these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. And I just -- can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve -- if you have a recession, the effect of the yield curve will be very different than you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made non-stop by us and the thing that happened in the marketplace. And I just -- I think we spend too much time on just this relevancy. So you get a model -- a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than 87% next year, probably not a lot, we don't know and we don't know the environment. Jeremy Barnum : Good. Okay. Now, to your question about the EAR. So a few things to say in there. So as I already mentioned, we -- when that comes out, it will show a number of around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EAR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EAR, which is what we disclosed. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EAR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question, which is a little bit about the front end versus the back end. So what you see is that actually the front end EAR has gotten smaller and most of the EAR is now in the back end. So it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin from the context of next year's numbers, a headwind -- would be a headwind for us. We remain asset-sensitive to Fed cuts. Erika Najarian : And if I can ask my second question, and Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long-term shareholders really don't care about whether it's 87% or 85%, right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter. And so beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend increases, how should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business. And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about how you're thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital? Jamie Dimon : Okay. So first of all, when you say, dominant I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition. Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital. And it's a deployment in a different way because you open branches, you initially experience an expense, but down the road, you need capital supports, the deposits and same for the innovation economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a minimum $30 billion of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think things -- the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view and you -- in life, you've got to take a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait. We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well-served by just waiting. And same thing with deploying capital, we can buy -- we can go buy $100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple of billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that. The most important thing we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also know what the real excess capital is yet. So we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it will be fine. And so that's where we are and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know, right? And we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Jamie Dimon : And one last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long-term for our company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. You may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So glad Jamie didn't say what he's about to say because that's the answer to this question. So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also. Limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're one of the best asset managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things you're working on and why that's too narrow, the view of your ability to serve all parts of clients' lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending side. Thanks. Jamie Dimon : Yes. So let me take time to cover this one because obviously, it is very -- become very important. People are talking about how they're growing and partnering, and things like that. And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical. I think they're both important. First and foremost, we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best products and services are for them. Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and minuses. Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unit tranche. It is more expensive and you're seeing little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending, but we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them what those products are across the things. We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital, some of this already been paid-off, some are done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going at $10 billion, could be $20 million or $30 billion, not limited today. I will say today we're extending -- we will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we will do more billion, we'll do it sole-handed or do it with partners. Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have -- and I think we've announced a bunch of co-lenders, but that just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down, have to get permission for everybody because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. So you could -- and we're going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that. Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing. And we're going to different strategy. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that would limit what we could offer our clients. Probably we could be more price-competitive. We can do some of the very specific thing and not the solution that fits the third-party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it. And we're going to do it in spite of the fact there's capital arbitrage taking place. So if you look at the arbitrage today, where the bank has to hold for things, with the insurance guys, they are dramatically different. That's a disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other business for a long time. We are going to do what's right for the client. Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often. So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that. So I hope if any of the press is on, they heard this too. Glenn Schorr : All right, thanks for all that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they're obviously very healthy. Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr touched on some of the specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal. How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today? Jamie Dimon : Yes. When I said we're at $30 billion excess, that is assuming Barr speech that the $20 billion goes $12 billion wherever it is more. But it will be more than that because there are other factors involved. Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital. In my view, it would be more, but it is what it is, and we'll wait to see the final numbers. Jeremy Barnum : But Gerard, maybe to give you a bit of color. So yes, obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal, because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal, so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate. I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed, which is obviously true, part of the speech. But I do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that, that's like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, what you obviously know that before this proposal came out, it was our position strongly felt that our then prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, already more than we needed. So we've got a long way to go here. And I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that they need to get it right, the right amount of work and importantly, do it holistically. So it's not just RWA, it's RWA, it's G-SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's really what we feel strong. Jamie Dimon : We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we'll be fine with that, too. I just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the economy, where it pushes lending and things like that. So we're anxiously waiting to see the actual detail because that's what's going to make all the difference. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, in view of this excess capital in your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation, of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loan is $1.3 trillion. When everything -- when the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame now for us, can you -- levering up the excess capital with more loans, is that an asset might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix. Jamie Dimon : Absolutely positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance sheet, we're fine. Jeremy Barnum : And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital, we're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically. And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that we've always had. But I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would think of it as it's there for a rainy day. Let's hope the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot. But if it does, we'll be ready. And there'll be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against the client franchise or against the stock and if not, we'll return it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Appreciate the color and candor as always. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines. I mean, obviously, we just had one cut and it's early, but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again, conversion of the banking pipelines? Jeremy Barnum : I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in Investment Banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as, to some degree, driven by the acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the types of deals that are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline. And those are often driven by treasurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that, that's a little of a consequence of the cuts. But I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pickup in mortgage applications, tiny bit of pickup in refi and our multi-family lending business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced, right? The curve has been inverted for a long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So I'm not -- it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions, and that's not really what we're seeing. Jamie Dimon : I noticed in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense to people taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, ongoing conditions late next year. Matt O'Connor: And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year-over-year, up 6%, flat Q-Q. I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend, either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense, because what's happened is that it's become normal. So meaning -- I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic. But maybe one last time. One of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a lot of traveling, and they booked cruises that they hadn't done before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discretionary spending, and that's now normalized. And you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into non-discretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we see it as is actually like normalization. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending. So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of new landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we always point out, that's one scenario, and there are many other scenarios. Matt O'Connor: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hey. Jamie, I think I've seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career. And August 2, op-ed, Washington Post, Davos, you're talking about government. I think it was this week or last week on Bloomberg, you're saying bank merger should be allowed. Your bus tour in August, you were asked, which is my question now, under what circumstances would you leave for government service? And your answer then was, I love what I do. We get it. You love what you do, but on what circumstances would you consider government service? It seems like you'd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that you've made. Is that right, wrong? What's your thinking? Jamie Dimon : I think it's wrong. I've always been a American patriot. And my country is more important to me then my company, and I think that the government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world. So I'm not just talking about the American economy. So -- and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at the international level to try to help -- that's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, in my opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help government do a good job. Mike Mayo : So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it? Jamie Dimon : I think the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably I\u2019m not going to do it. But I've always reserved the right, I don't make promise to people. We don't have to. But now, I mean, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what we're doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the Board kicks me out. Mike Mayo : Let me take the flip side of that question, for those who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question is, we're on these calls the last couple of years, you're saying the stock is overvalued. And I think part -- I think that's what you're saying. You're saying the stock market is overvalued, and therefore, all stocks are overvalued. And on the one hand, you highlighted on this call, AI, tech, market share gains, high returns, high capital. So do you think in some way, when you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI? Jamie Dimon : Well, listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises and the price point when you might buy the stock, but I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values. And so I'm just -- we're just quite patient in that. And I think you're going to have to judge us over time about we've done the right thing enough. And remember, we can always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The only time we'll wrong if the stock runs way up, you've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just -- I would be real skeptic about that happening. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading? Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of FIC activity? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk, but as a reality like we've always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And that applies to -- and that competitive environment isn't limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to Fintech\u2019s. And in the market-making space, it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to. Now those firms are many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the private credit space that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You've got changes in market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways. Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosystem, which is the end view of the world, it's worked well in its current contract for a long time where some activities were inside the regulatory perimeter. And there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intentional and well-studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability, given the constraints of the current rule set. Jamie Dimon : Can I just add, so in the private markets, that remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets. In some ways, we're well positioned with that, too, because for that, you need liquidity, market making, valuation, buyers and sellers in both sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet. But we're not -- we may have competition, but we'll be there when the time comes. And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about dealer inventories, both corporate and treasuries. And I do think that's hampered a little bit. But again, we do it -- remember for clients, so we are a large market makers in both sides of the markets for clients, both credit and treasuries. And a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so they're both competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're going to deploy more capital we want. And we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do it to service clients. So we're very conscious of it with the competition on both sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10-years ago, talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that. And so far, we have. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one quick one. And Jeremy, you mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of September. Just give us your perspective on the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year-end. How -- and do you have a view on how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some [Technical Difficulty]? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question in other words, like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves that's been heavily speculated about and recognizing that, that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms' liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures. And side point is just another reason why it's important to look at the whole frame more holistically when we think about the regulatory response in the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of hikes, and it raises some questions about why there isn't more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor. But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound down. And that seems to be increasingly the consensus that, that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So final point was if you play that view through, it's a residual headwind for a system-wide deposit growth, which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level. Jamie Dimon : Yeah. So I just want to add a couple of policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there, partially driven by QE. And also look at the volatility, it's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have -- I've already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy to the repo markets. And is it a good policy to think that every time that happens because you can do it very safely, fully collateralize all things like that, providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace that, that happens, the Fed has to step in every time. I think that becomes a policy issue that every time there comes some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Feds got to stump in and provide stuff. And can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward? So I think you have to be very thoughtful about this. That's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECLR and CET1 and all these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be -- when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen again. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hello, hi, good morning. Jeremy Barnum : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me? Hello? Jamie Dimon : Yes, we can hear you. Yes. Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me okay? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us? Betsy Graseck : Oh, yes. Thank you. So, one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue, so I kind of care about it. But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the buildup, QT ending deposit growth, I mean that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025, right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number from you for NII for 2025, but it is in there, right? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right? You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve and you've got balances, and balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential tailwind -- one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there is a reason that we emphasized the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation, which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech. The changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the [Technical Difficulty] I'm trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that, that number has historically and in the recent past been quite liability sensitive. So you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue, but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point. Betsy Graseck : And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you... Jeremy Barnum : Those were core NII or NII ex. So again, reiterating at the time, the '24 consensus was $91.5 billion, the '25 consensus was $90 billion on NII ex. And our point was that, that number, which remains an asset-sensitive number, indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline year-on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex-Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer, albeit maybe still a little bit toppy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage? Jamie Dimon : Yes. So I mean always say, assets acquisitions. I mean, I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and being -- but if you listen to what I'm saying about my question about the world, I'm not -- it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets. Betsy Graseck : What about... Jamie Dimon : [Multiple Speakers] Creating credit assets to help clients, that's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit asset spread and we usually have other stuff. That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time, can we do more in affordable housing? Can we do more in things we're actually quite comfortable? And yes, if we can find ways to deploy capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in a [Multiple Speakers] stretch. Betsy Graseck : I'm just wondering about the private label credit card, for example. Is that something that would help clients? Jamie Dimon : Almost no chance. But having -- it's very important. Why I say that, I always tell the management team second guess me. I mean, we've done private label. I know what it is. We've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible that something is different one day and a different thing? Yeah, it's possible. So I don't want to cut it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie, you're not thinking clearly, the world's changed, we're going to change. But right now, I would say, no chance. Betsy Graseck : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years? You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going. So I guess, how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say to level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be wrong, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offsets, you mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out your -- the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CC deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firm-wide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside duration management and all those other factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits. But it -- we have not needed to reprice in order to retain bank relationships, which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits. As I mentioned, we're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay onto that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the build-out and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number. So we believe there's a big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of like average annual share growth of the order of 30 or 40 basis points that we've seen historically, that's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer. Jamie Dimon : Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was in was in race were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens. It's 2% to 2.5%. Jeremy Barnum : Absolutely. Agree. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's helpful. So it sounds like you're a little bit above that, but there's still some pressure, but you're not dramatically above those levels. Jamie Dimon : Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management. We're growing market share. And when we build branches and stuff like that, we don't necessarily assume current margins. We look at what could be normal margins over time. We're very comfortable, very nice business for you all. Jeremy Barnum : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. That's all I got. Jamie Dimon : Thanks, Saul. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorgan Chase's website, please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion with an ROTCE of 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. The firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion or 10% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances. NII ex-markets was up $3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. And markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year, I'll remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of $173 billion and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year, in CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and security services, and in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolver growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card. The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IV fees were up 49% year-on-year and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower losses on hedges. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 20% with better performance in credit as well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and derivatives amid increased volatility and higher trading volumes and cash. Security Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market levels as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns in lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations, and commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million, driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $104 billion for the full year -- $140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we had client asset net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 8; Corporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NII was a net loss of $30 million compared to the net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC Special Assessment of $2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on Page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits; firm-wide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend to assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firm-wide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of markets NII increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement, so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now let's turn to expenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume and revenue-related expense, which is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest in new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure, and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now let's turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap-up. On credit, we expect the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension in the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles, while we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A. Jamie Dimon : Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet. So, it's premature what I'm about it, guys, I just wanted to say I'd be -- and I'd be remiss not to say, here's a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed-income trading, and then became Co-Head of the Investment Bank and the sole Head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. And over that whole time, he was helping build one of the great investment banks in the world, and so -- and then obviously, he was President for five years or more, a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone at the company. So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made. Jeremy Barnum : Great. All right. So let's go to questions. Operator : Thank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So I guess what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment opportunities? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, good question, John, and welcome back, by the way. So... Jamie Dimon : Welcome back, John, read your theme the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work. John McDonald : Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : So yes, you've noted all the points that we always make, so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough, we have enough excess. And given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here. So when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the near-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of the excess, and that is our current plan, although I'll give you the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year. How does it differ from, say, last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities, in the Commercial & Investment Bank, we continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff, as we do that. But broadly, the themes were very consistent. I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and there's been a lot of focus on the development environment for them in order to enable them to be more productive, and so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of efficient -- a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization and so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization spend. Now as Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might come down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I would say is that, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it's been for very good reasons and it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and our ability to run the company efficiently, but anytime you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we're going to try to run things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as they get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment and growth. So obviously branches and bankers and so on, and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment. John McDonald : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed. Mike Mayo : Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who is your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, how -- why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, this goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So why say you're going to stay less than five years and you're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and the regulatory costs and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for, so why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway, you don't play golf, you aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. It seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around? Jamie Dimon : I do love what I do and answering the second question first. Look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior people in the company, it's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years and I may or may not be Chairman, that's going to be up to the Board, does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that. Now you're targeting potentially four, five years or more. I'm 60 -- I'll be 69 in March. I think it's a rational thing to do. I've had a couple of health problems you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so -- and what's your first question you began? Mike Mayo : Who is you're successor? Jamie Dimon : I mean this is -- look, this is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and all the toing and froing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jen Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating Officer and stay after that. So obviously, she's willing to work for those people, which I think is great for a company that's having continuity of management and leadership and it will be more of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And of course, at the last minute, a couple of years from now, people get sick, they change their mind, they have family circumstances. So even if you thought you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure. Mike Mayo : So, you will stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now? Jamie Dimon : Yes. Basic case, yes. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new soon to be, I guess, a new Head of Regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about again what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for you, and is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down or is this more of a story of requirements just simply stop going up? Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Jim, I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot, but I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the different parts of the framework and how they could evolve. And I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some attempt to answer your question. So backing off a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy that isn't reflexively anti-bank. It doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that we got some of that and that also while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III endgame, it's also G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors and that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so be it. Jamie Dimon : I'll just add. Jeremy, gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of recognition that more counts of liquidity and discount windows and how LCR has done, I think is very important. Second is competition. All of these things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in the banking system, what do you want out of the banking system. And the third is, I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step back and look at the business team volcanized system we built, which has negatives and even the regulars will tell you that. So one point, just take a deep breath as Jeremy said, do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world. Jim Mitchell : Yes, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth, have you -- since the election, it seems like CEO confidence, business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be great. Jamie Dimon : Yes, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably explained by a combination of wide open capital markets. And so many of the larger corporates are accessing the capital markets and healthy balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets in some industries where some aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what they're executing in the near term. But we'll see what the New Year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality one way or the other and maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth in particular. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of Jeremy, the cross currents in terms of the denominator. So if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So obviously, from what we understand, if you print that somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test. So as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So as we think about your returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So how should we think about those cross currents in terms of two big components, clearly one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer? Jeremy Barnum : Right, Erica. Okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. So let's try to address this not at too much great length. First of all, G-SIB; so yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter or fourth quarter. So while our current view of the G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures in various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal pattern. So not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other, but anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under five. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So that's great. I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute limitations deadlines that were coming up. So let's just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually. What is our core view about -- if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analyses of like a flat numerator, up 5 numerator, up 10 numerator, up 20 numerator, I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less. And then guessing about our several case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7 and I think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore. Erika Najarian : And just a follow-up question. Follow-up to John's line of questioning, as a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% we bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, you've quoted our capital hierarchy and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the excess. Jamie Dimon : So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. I mean, you all know that everybody is out there modeling these things and trading against these things. So steady, consistent buyers in the marketplace were so predictable are making a mistake. Operator : Does that conclude your question, Erika? Jamie Dimon : You go to the next question. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all because of the higher-rate environment that's expected now or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen? Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe -- let me try to frame that from a couple of different perspectives. So on the one hand, you're right, if you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current forwards, which as we know is the one thing that we know won't happen, but if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards, we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all else being equal. And, you could draw the conclusion that means that the over-earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated. For a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that for the time being, anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle, unclear, but I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year. Jamie Dimon : We've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit. Jeremy Barnum : Yes, it is worth noting, that NII ex-market is down year-on-year. So, there's some amount of normalization there. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question, there's been some reports about you further expanding the consumer banking business globally, and I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way, obviously, your approach is kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally, but I guess I'm just wondering like, is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risks of dealing with global consumer banking? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think you kind of answered your own question in the sense like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. And that's not to say that like we're special or anything, it's just that the strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative, it's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and opportunities associated with the decision and that's one of our strategic initiatives and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of our management processes. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Jeremy Barnum : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, can you hear me, okay. All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loans, but basically balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to the -- could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you've got the green market-share, number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are, where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody is -- every single business has one or are there some that have more than others and therefore, more opportunities and is it more balance sheet or fee generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks. Jeremy Barnum : Sure. Yes, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in that category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance would be acquisition finance, because that's been relatively muted as a function of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long. So, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue, but as we -- as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be -- it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite, still growing above-trend obviously, which is great and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates, rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So yes, I think a higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking, could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more on the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So we'll see. We'll see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they're aligned with our big longstanding investment strategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space, we are significantly underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So that's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the markets business, inside investment banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level, we look great in any given region and any given sub-sector, we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Jeremy Barnum : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of cross currents, like if we anchor to the fact that you have an administration that's taking play and you'll take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rate cuts, when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yes, I would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective, what no rate cuts might mean. Jeremy Barnum : I see what your question is, just give me a second. Yes. I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we were coming out of a 10 plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate. And so at some point, that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, if we go to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully normalized and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress test on the sensitivities to the portfolio -- of the portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So you can rest assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to add? Jamie Dimon : I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment, that's both on the consumer side and it bleeds into the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, subprime, credit card. So really it's your forecast of unemployment, which you're going to have to make your own, which will determine that over time, and so -- and the second thing that you said vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would be stagflation, higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. I'm not -- we're not predicting that, but you just asked where the vulnerabilities -- as the vulnerabilities. Ebrahim Poonawala : Okay. And I guess, thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on how -- when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit growth? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. I mean, I think the conventional wisdom on QT and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other is that the tapering should sort of complete and therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds models and that type of stuff. When you look at the way RFP is behaving, evolution of QT expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling about our sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit balances through the second half of the year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned... Jeremy Barnum : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : You mentioned in your comments about the overall firm-wide deposits have stabilized and in the second half, you could see some growth in your various -- I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits, we noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you -- based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits? Jeremy Barnum : That's fascinating, Gerard, I'll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers, but I can speak for ourselves, which is that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some excess and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring a lot of new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets. So, the combination of the tail end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build-out of that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with us the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective, not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital? If you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity, you're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective? Jeremy Barnum : Yes. So we made some public comments on this at a conference sometime back, so, he wants to go. Jamie Dimon : Sorry, Jeremy, go ahead. Jamie Dimon : I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people don't want it, doesn't have shareholder value. And I've never thought that having cash in your pocket is a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to look at likely, you have to deploy capital. So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special dividends, they really basically don't work. Jeremy Barnum : If anyone has a different opinion, well I was interested. Gerard Cassidy : Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. Jeremy Barnum : Thanks very much. Jamie Dimon : Thanks very much. See you next quarter. Operator : Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
