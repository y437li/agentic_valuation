I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang :  Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our first fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our first quarter revenue was $309 million in the traditionally weaker season. It\u2019s 4.1% lower quarter-over-quarter and 14.2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $9.9 million or 12.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 223.4% higher compared to last year. Super Micro\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in last quarter and $0.07 last year. Slide five and six please. We are pleased with last quarter\u2019s revenue, which was 14.2% higher than last year. This is a strong performance for typically tougher quarter for IT spending. This quarter the growth is likely to be the strongest among our competition. Here is a [fiscal] breakdown of last quarter\u2019s revenue, our server system contribute 46.4% of our total revenue. The 39.1% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and Direct customers with the Internet Data Center accounting for 8.3% of sales. These results indicated that more and more of our partners choose our completed servers services due to the higher quality and performance optimization. Geographically, revenue in North America was 56.7%, Europe was 23% and Asia was 17.8% of total sales. North America and Europe continues to be strong and consistent. Recently we acquired a new 36-acre San Jose campus to accommodate our future growth or the American market. We also saw a strong growth from a stable product mix on a year-to-year basis. Our FatTwin system was at 176%. Storage was up 24%. Blade was 28% higher. GPU and Xeon Phi solutions were 25% higher. MicroCloud grew 116% and continues to ramp strongly.  Finally, our switch product saw a good demand and was 66% higher. Super Micro always grew in the period of technology transition. This quarter the new Ivy Bridge processor launched in the middle of September and most of our products were ready to support the new processor at launch. Despite the base quarter launch, the product volume ramp nicely. The Ivy Bridge announced for TwinPro is another great display of our engineering strength and business sense. Our unique business model is (inaudible) in developing trajectory based product and to be first to market. Proving that point we had developed over 80 optimized server solutions for the Ivy Bridge processor ready at launch. Even now we are still ahead of competition with the most Ivy Bridge solutions available in the market. Our business model, they are not stopped by innovation along technology cycles. We continue to create brand new products that lead the industry. For example, our FatTwin architecture found the great success is to scale out datacenter applications, which is advantage in energy saving, performance, density, cost and easier maintenance. Super Micro (inaudible) developed the Twin architecture with higher performance, expandability and a greater efficiency. As a result the Twin product and something else new and exciting will be coming soon. Another example is our MicroCloud which is 3U multiple node solution for datacenter, web hosting and cloud applications. Starting with a node as a first, we recently had launched our 24 node solution and that\u2019s the outfit in the 3U enclosure. Furthermore as competition has set up for low power, low cost, high density servers, Super Micro have developed a 6U, 112 node MicroBlade system (inaudible) low power deal and other processors. The system was recently on display at this year\u2019s Intel Developers Forum or IDF. Super Micro also continues to launch new high density HPC solutions. They\u2019re focused on GPU and Xeon Phi support from when you see some risk for GPU or Xeon Phi support to embrace solutions with 20 GPU or Xeon Phi support in 7U. Super Micro had the wide list of range of GPU and Xeon Phi server solutions in the market. The newest edition will support a GPU or Xeon Phi in the 4U system. That\u2019s designed in a way with no components presented the fully redundant features on power including also improved systems activity and availability. On the software and service side, we had developed a software suite to have our customer manage their server costs and data centers remotely. We have also officially launched our on-site service program this quarter to satisfy mission critical customers, who need on talk, enable our support. These products are becoming high value sources, always steady popular speed. Now let me take a moment to address market conditions and how Super Micro is positioned to compete. We heard that our larger competitors talk about how tough the market is and we see that their revenue have been declining for many quarters, during this time, while our competitor struggles, Super Micro grows and continue grow strongly in spite of the industry competition and macroeconomic tailwind. Of course the IT market is tough, but Super Micro has continued to develop industry leading product. They have won the market share because of their superior pure performance, performance per watt, per dollars and square foot. This business model enabled us for success in this industry and we continue to take market share. We\u2019re getting asked why we are successful when we are not the biggest. The answer is simple, our strong R&D, our strong global foundation now and our strong dedication as a team. We understand when you are not the biggest you have to complete smarter and harder to win. In fact our corporate culture embraced competition since the beginning of our company. And our employees dedicated themselves to become the best in the industry. Indeed we are united in that believe and we are on track to grow strongly. But for more specific on the first quarter let me turn it to over to Howard. Howard Hideshima :  Thank you, Charles. And good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses, reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter\u2019s income. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was 309 million, up 14.2% from a same quarter a year ago and down 0.1% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales the growth for our new products such as FatTwin, Storage, MicroCloud, GPU, Xeon Phi, the switches and racks, highlight the importance of innovation and servicing the variety of needs which our customers demand. In addition we have continued to build our brand and image and expanded our product offering, not only in hardware but also in management software and support. This does further open opportunities in the markets for us. On a geographical basis U.S. and Europe grew 30% and 12.2% over last year respectively. Asia was down 15% due to competition from local suppliers. The sequential decrease in revenues from last quarter is primarily due to seasonal weakness around the world. Asia was particularly weak due to lower data center projects last quarter. We do see strength in our Xeon Phi, GPU and MicroCloud products which grew over 30% sequentially. In addition, Ivy Bridge was launched in mid September. With Ivy models available at the time of launch we continue to offer the broadest array of solution to our customers and it puts us in a great position to take advantage of this product type. Slide eight. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues for server systems was 46.4% of total revenues which result from 39.5% the same quarter a year ago and down from 47.4% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,600 per unit which is up from $2,000 last year and up from $2,400 last quarter. We shipped approximately 55,000 servers in the first quarter and 1, 56,000 sub systems and accessories. Our server units were about the same as last year. The compute notes have increased from the prior year from customers who are driving our high density solutions. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and now these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet data center revenue was 8.3% which was a decrease from 9.5% in the prior quarter and 8.8% in the prior year. Furthermore 56.7% of our revenues came from U.S. and 60.9% from our distributors and reseller.  Slide 9 and 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $47 million, up 33% from $35.3 million in the same quarter last year, and up 2% from $46.3 million, sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.2%, up from 13% a year ago and up from 14.4%, sequentially. Price changes for Ablecom resulted in no basis points changed to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 17.3% of total cost of goods sold compared to 20.9% a year ago and 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from price changes in hard disk drive since the flood in October 2011. A lower provision for inventory reserves given product transition which occurred last year with the launch of Sandy Bridge as well as the favorable product mix in the current quarter when compared to the prior year.  Sequentially, gross margin was up due to favorable product mix and more complete server solutions and less internet datacenter revenue as well lower inventory reserves. Hard disk drive, pricing was stable and memory pricing did increase in between the quarters. However, neither had a material effect to the gross margin. Slide 11. Operating expenses were $32.4 million, up from $30.7 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $31.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 10.5% down from 11.3% year-over-year and up from 9.7% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D at personnel expenses increase due to the annual salary increase and material expenses associated with the rollout of Ivy Bridge. Sequentially operating expenses were up due to higher personnel expenses associated with annual salary increases as well as prototype material and testing fees associated with the rollout of our Ivy Bridge 8 products. The company headcount increased by 15 sequentially to 1,610 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our product portfolio.   Operating profit was $14.6 million, up by $10 million from $4.6 million a year ago and down by $5.5 million from $15.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis operating margin was 4.7% up from 1.7% a year ago and equal to 4.7% sequentially. Net income was $9.9 million or 3.2% of revenues, up from $6.8 million from $3.1 million a year ago, and down $1.4 million from $11.3 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.22 per share, up from $0.07 per share a year ago and down from $0.26 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 44,984,000.   The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 31.7% compared to 31.3% a year ago and 24.7% sequentially. The rate was higher from last quarter due to the pending exploration of the R&D tax credit and lower tax benefits from Taiwan. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31% for the second quarter, which is up from 24.5% in the same quarter last year. The increase reflects the pending exploration of the R&D tax credit in December of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were a $114.2 million, up $18.5 million from $95.7 million in the prior quarter and up $52.9 million from $61.3 in the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, free cash flow was a positive $16.4 million primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable from record revenues in the prior quarter. Slide 13, accounts receivable decreased by $15.2 million to $134.1 million with DSO was 42 days, an increase of four days from 38 days in the prior quarter. Inventory of $254.3 million was comparable to the prior quarter with days inventories increasing by five days to 89 days. The increase in inventory days was primarily due to lower cost of goods sold during the first quarter. Account payable decreased by $7.2 million to $165.7 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by four days to 59 days primarily due to decrease of cost of goods sold in the quarter as mentioned above. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 72 days, an increase of five days from 67 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on the [ops], during the first quarter we saw a seasonally weak quarter, in which we continue to grow faster than the industry and take market share from our competitors. As we entered the second quarter, we have a full array of solutions to take advantage of the Ivy Bridge launch. In addition the same quarter is also a seasonally strong quarter for the industry. Therefore the company currently expect net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2013 in the range of $320 million to $350 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.31 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. Last quarter\u2019s results indicated that Super Micro is off to a strong start for this fiscal year. Many of our popular product line performed strongly. Our leadership in innovative architecture and optimized total solutions are firmly in place. I am confident that we will continue our growth trends in the coming quarters and years. Operator at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Yeah thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the Ivy Bridge ramp, how we expect to see, how big of a contributor was that in the September quarter and how much of an impact do you expect in the December quarter? And on that same topic, historically we\u2019ve seen in past cycles some benefit on a gross margin basis, what\u2019s your assumption on gross margin as that product cycle materializes? Charles Liang : Okay, I mean, I\u2019d just say anytime there are economic transition, it\u2019s a good window for Super Micro to grow. And Ivy Bridge basically will provide some opportunities as well. So because our [regional launch] was September around 15th, September 10th, right? So it\u2019s kind of pretty much end of last quarter. So not much impact to last quarter, but we are having more impact to this quarter, I mean December quarter. And we have kind of strong product liability, I mean other than Ivy Bridge. So our December quarter and next coming quarters, I believe will be a strong way. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And you mentioned obviously Asia-Pac down 15% year-over-year in this most recent quarter. You mentioned two items, obviously week over our datacenter spending and you also had mentioned competitive dynamics. Can you take those two items and talk a little bit about them, what are you seeing competitively relative to maybe the weakness in this quarter being attributable to just push outs in datacenter spending? Howard Hideshima : Hey, Aaron, this is Howard. With regards to the comments on in Asia, yeah saw some weakness based on some of the yen issues that have happened over the last year. So again that caused us to be a little less competitive in the local geo other than that there are various competitions going on out there in Asia more so than across the rest of the world. We are positioning ourselves very well with --. So everybody again we are getting more competitive out there. Charles Liang : And that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important we continue to a stronger aggressive debate, specifically our manpower in Asia. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, I\u2019ll see you folks. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today\u2019s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today\u2019s presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of the second fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our second quarter revenue was $356.4 million. It\u2019s 15.3% higher quarter-over-quarter and 22.3% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $15.9 million or 60.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 103% higher compared to last year. Super Micro\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $0.22 last quarter and $0.18 last year. Slide five and six please. Super Micro\u2019s second quarter was record high for revenue and earnings. We grew again in market products or industries gross rate. Our foundation in product innovation and global operation came together this quarter to produce these record results. Here is a fiscal breakdown of last quarter\u2019s revenue, our server system contribute 48.8% of our total revenue. 46.6% of our business last quarter came from OEM and Direct customers, with the Internet Data Center accounting for 12.9% of sales, which increased 55.4% from last quarter. Our continued focus on offering completed systems and total solutions is again showing strong progress. More partners from both channel and Direct are moving toward taking completed system from Super Micro because of its higher product quality, greater time-to-market, optimized product performance and power efficiency and available global logistics support. Geographically, revenue in North America was 50.4% and Europe was 23.9% of total sales. Notably, Asia jumped to 23% of our total revenue, contribution which was up from 17.8% last quarter and 20.7% last year. As I have said before, Asia will become a large part of our revenue story, due to our readiness at Taiwan facility. We are able to scale and deliver high quality product for Asia and certain world-wide customer base. Europe revenue also was up approximately 27% comparing to a year ago. North America our largest and most consistent market was up significantly in absolute dollars from last quarter, while Asia has shown most strength in term of total revenue of percentage. In last quarter\u2019s earnings, I mentioned several aspect of Super Micro\u2019s effort to build a stronger foundation. Allow me to emphasize again the strength of our company including our product innovation and global production capacity. Super Micro is continuing to develop further products that have won the market praise because of their superior application optimization and pure performance, performance per watt, per dollars and per square foot. For example, during the quarter, we launched the TwinPro Architecture that supports by interchanging First SAS 3.0 storage, NVMe, accelerated PCI-E SSD performance and Titanium Level efficiency power supply in the data center optimized package. Other than the TwinPro, we are also preparing to launch the brand new ultra high density extreme low power Microblade architecture on this March which will support 112 Atom Nodes or 28 dual processor DM nodes in the 6U form factor. Now Microblade will feature integrated 2.5G or 10GE switch. Then we\u2019ll enter to introduce the cable course and TCO for our customers and to extend our technology leadership that TwinPro and the MicroBlade are great beginning options to come in 2014. We also saw a strong growth for many product lines on a year-to-year basis. Our FatTwin, the key products of 2013, grew 128% -- 129% year-over-year. Our storage solution demonstrate strong growth last quarter by 49% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter. Our HPC Solutions including GPU and Xeon Phi grew 58% year-over-year and 35% sequentially. The Intel Ivy Bridge achievement and switch product are also ramping nicely and have been to create additional demand. All these products suggest that our application optimize solutions are in great demand by cloud service, data center, channel partner and large corporate accounts. As we extend our offerings to a software suite that remotely managed data center and on site service for mission-critical application customers, who need long [accountable] our support. I\u2019m confident that this product will become best resources of our stated revenue stream in 2014. Parallel to our growth in product, our global operation foundation is getting much stronger as well. The growth in our Asia business this quarter can be shown sooner utilization of our Taiwan facility that had record high utilization and delivery volume. In addition, our rapid business growth has driven the need to utilize all available space we have at Taiwan and remote production capacity \u201809. As soon as our Taiwan capacity reached 60% at our existing site, we will begin our next phase of our Asia expansion plan. I strongly believe this preparation will happen this year as we reach for our $2 billion revenue target. In summary, Super Micro had a record quarter for revenue and earnings because of our investment we had met to ensure, we had room for our growth. We are in the strongest position than ever before. And we are realizing multiple times of industry growth rate as we\u2019re faster approaching the $2 billion revenue growth. Now, we are extremely focused on executing our strength in technology and leveraging our global foundation. We believe calendar 2014 will be a very strong year for Super Micro. For more specifics on our first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on the non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 11 -- 7. Revenue was a record $356.4 million, up 22.3% from the same quarter a year ago and 15.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales particularly in our innovative product such as Storage, FatTwin, GPU/Xeon Phi, Racks and Switches. This couple with our management software and support services has further opened opportunities in the market for us. On geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. A sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonal strength in the industry and continued strength in our innovative product above. In addition, Ivy Bridge which was launched on September 10 continue to ramp nicely, benefited by a broad product line. Turning to product mix, a portion of revenues from server systems was 48.8% of total revenues which was up from 43.3% for same quarter a year ago and from 46.4% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2700 per unit which is up from $2100 last year and up from $2600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 63,000 servers in the second quarter and 1,173,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and none of these customers are representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet data center revenue was 12.9% which was an increase from 8.3% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 14.2% in the prior year. Furthermore 50.4% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 53.4% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine and 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $55.3 million, up 37.2% from $40.3 million in the same quarter last year, and up 17.7% from $47 million, sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.5%, up from 13.8% a year ago and up from 15.2% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis points change to gross profit in the quarter and total purchases representing approximately 18.1% of total cost of goods sold compared to 15.4% a year ago and 17.3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from strong vendor relationships, lower provision for inventory reserves, given product transition last year and a favorable product mix. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to higher utilizations of our facilities, favorable product mix and more complete server solutions and an increase purchasing power due in part to increasing the scale of our business. Slide 11. Operating expenses were $32.3 million, up from $29.9 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $32.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses was 9.1% down from 10.2% year-over-year and down from 10.5% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support the development of our products. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to less prototype material and testing fees with the rollout of our Ivy Bridge Based products in September. The company headcount increased by 51 sequentially to 1,661 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our product portfolio. Operating profit was $23 million, up by 118.6% from $10.5 million a year ago and by 57.1% from $14.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.4%, up from 3.6% a year ago and from 4.7% sequentially. The operating is at the lower end of our target model. Net income was $15.9 million or 4.5% of revenues, up 103% from $7.8 million a year ago, and 60.9% from $9.9 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.35 per share, up from $0.18 per share a year ago and from 22% per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 46,022,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 30.5% compared to 24.5% a year ago and 31.7% sequentially. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the release of tax liability. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31.8% for the third quarter, which is up from negative 23.1% in the same quarter last year. The increase reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in March of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $92.6 million, down $21.6 million from $114.2 million in the prior quarter, and up $1.5 million from $91.1 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative $31.9 million, primarily due to purchases of 36-acres of property in San Jose, California for $30.2 million. Slide 13, accounts receivable increased by $27.1 million to $161.2 million due to record revenues mentioned above. DSOs was 38 days, a decrease of four days from 42 days in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $36.6 million to $290.9 million to support the looming year all day shutdown in Asia. Days and inventories decreased by 6 days to 83 days. Account payable increased by $40.1 million to $205.8 million due to increased inventories mentioned above. Days payable outstanding increased by two days to 57 days. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 64 days, a decrease of eight days from 72 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook, during the second quarter, we saw a sequential -- seasonally strong quarter in which we continued to grow at multiples of the industry determine by the foundation of investments we have made in the past in our technology and infrastructure. As we enter the third quarter which is a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, we look to further take advantage of the foundation we have built to continue to drive our growth. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2014 in a range of $320 million to $350 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.24 to $0.30 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. Again, last quarter was a record quarter of revenue and earnings for Super Micro, providing that Super Micro is leading server, storage and competitive solution company and a strong competitor. We believe that we are well-positioned for a very strong calendar year 2014 and possibly reaching the $2 billion run rate very soon. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will first go to Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a great quarter there, guys. Want to talk about Ivy Bridge contribution in the quarter. Can you quantify how strong that was in the quarter, can you quantify where we are in that product cycle and how that should rollout over the next couple quarters? Charles Liang : Yeah. Ivy Bridge is still a pretty new product. Again, they are available for about one and half quarters and quarter-to-quarter, we grew about 70% for Ivy Bridge. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: As far as -- yeah, of volumes. Charles Liang : So kind of new products, so I believe we are continuing to grow. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Okay. And I will -- my follow-up question kind of unrelated, the competitive landscape, clearly you are growing faster than just about every other vendor out there. How do you think that landscape might change if IBM were to divest their x86 business as was no more today? Charles Liang : Yeah. For sure, it\u2019s an not an easier task and that\u2019s why we have spend lots of efforts to build our foundation in terms of engineering capability, in terms of global operation cost and all of those investment were been heavily in the last three years, have been pretty ready. And that\u2019s why we start to see the advantage to grow stronger than others. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Okay. Thanks. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and then also congratulations on the quarter. I would like to talk a little bit about gross margin. Some of the levers that you still see in front of you, I guess starting with where you stand today on the Taiwan facility in terms of utilization where we expect that to be trending out over the next couple of quarters and then on top of that just remind us again if what other levers you have to kind of attaining your target model? Howard Hideshima : Yeah, Aaron, this is Howard. With regards to utilization on Taiwan, that was still about 41% for the December quarter and growing. Obviously it\u2019s a record for us, previous record for us was about 36%. So that\u2019s one of the levers we talked about with investors all the way along as far as increasing the utilization for not only the Taiwan facility but obviously our operations worldwide. So that\u2019s one of the important levers for our gross margins. We also hit a couple of other levers that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Product mix, as we drive towards more complete server solutions, it would be beneficial to our margins, growing our scale of business. Again that contributed during the quarter to improvement in margins and to a lesser extent we talked about software and support services. And I\u2019m glad to see that they are starting to contribute a little, albeit little but just starting to contribute for us. So the levers that we\u2019ve talked about in the past are -- it's quite gratifying to see some real numbers pulling behind. Charles Liang : Yeah. They all factor in, but it is still about one-year old new product. They continue to grow strongly. And we just announced our TwinPro, which is another kind of performance per watt enhance Twin Architecture. And just ramping up now quickly and follow by our MicroBlade in next few months. So, I mean, new product, new architecture, outperform competition that [help us a lot]. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And then as a follow up, I'd like to maybe understand a little bit better your Asia-Pac growth in particular was obviously notably impressive this quarter, especially in the context of what IBM just reported tonight. Can you talk about your exposure in Asia-Pac and in particular your positioning, how meaningful China is in your positioning specifically within China? Charles Liang : Yeah. I mean, Asia is relatively a new market for us, right. We started to focus on Asia aggressively about two to three years ago and now we have getting stronger foundation there, especially a production ready in Taiwan. So, I mean, we continue gaining good customer in both, China, Japan and Korea. So that's very solid trend to go I believe. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : And how big is China of Asia-Pac, can you help us understand that? Howard Hideshima : It's still roughly a majority of the Asia-Pac area. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We'll now go to Glenn Hanus from Needham. Glenn Hanus - Needham: Good afternoon. Liang, your Data Center business was up strongly. Can you talk about what the trend -- what was behind the trend there this quarter and maybe what to expect over the next few quarters? Charles Liang : Yeah. I guess, the major reason because our capacity in logistic global have been getting very strong. So we are much more ready to approach those huge Data Center now. So I believe we are continuing growing in that territory quickly. Glenn Hanus - Needham: So with some of the Data Center wins over in Asia or can you characterize maybe geographically where the growth really came from this quarter and was it sort of highly concentrated in a couple of large deals? Howard Hideshima : Yeah. Glenn, this is Howard. With regards to where it was -- we saw some nice deals in Asia, that grow some of the percentage is in Asia up during the quarter. We also saw some continued growth in the U.S. which was nice to see also. Charles Liang : And Europe as well. Howard Hideshima : And Europe as well. Charles Liang : Pleasantly, yeah. Glenn Hanus - Needham: And what's your outlook for the next few quarters there? Charles Liang : I guess we'll continue evenly growing, although, Asia will be a little faster. Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at time. So I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we are looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And that does conclude the Super Micro\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please come to slide four. First let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our third quarter revenue was 373.8 million. It\u2019s 4.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 34.4% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was 17.8 million or 11.8% higher quarter-over-quarter and 77.1% higher compared to last year. Super Micro\u2019s non-GAAP earning per share was $0.37 per diluted share compared to $0.35 last quarter and $0.23 last year. Slide five please. Super Micro\u2019s third quarter was the second straight quarter of record heights for revenue and earnings. We are especially pleased that we achieved this exceptional revenue growth during a seasonally weak quarter. We grew again in multiples for our industry expanded market share and continued to be believe that our industry\u2019s system architecture and solution innovation as well as marketing. Geographically, the revenue in North America was 54.5%, Europe was 21.7% and Asia was 21% of total sales. Most of our revenue growth comes from North America last quarter and was the strongest region while Europe and Asia follow a seasonal trend. As we said last quarter, our strong foundation in product innovation and global operations prepare Super Micro to speed up sales momentum in 2014. Our services contributed 50.1% of our total revenue. It is the first time ever in Super Micro\u2019s history that more than 50% of our sales come from computer systems. Computer server revenue mostly come from our OEM and direct customers which account for 48.1% and 15.9% from client and Internet data center. More and more of our customer understand that computer system and solutions from Super Micro bring more long value to their business. The systems have been optimized for performance, power efficiency and reliability, with our approved components, unique dedication and strict [inaudible] procedures for higher product quality and quicker [inaudible]. Now let me bring you up to-date on other several business progress. First, average product shipment increased 32% quarter-over-quarter as it continue to rent, it is still in rent cycle and we expect that this technology transition will continue through 2014. Second our Asia operation utilization rate is above 50% now is and is continuously growing. We hope to reach 100% capacity within 12 months, while we continuously speeding up our business growth in Asia. Moreover, we had just start to use our newly acquired computer parts in Silicon Valley a facility will provide immediate and additional operational resource to serve our faster growing domestic market. Slide six please. The results this quarter indicated that our products and services have continued to extend their leadership position. Let me provide you some more highlights on specific products and service. We have been providing some select customers with total solutions including hardware computer system, server management and applications software for few quarters. As a result, more customers now can depend on Super Micro to deliver end to end computer solutions higher bid about 20 [inaudible] for which applications and more. In addition, we just had recently launched service program to complement our total solutions. It will provide a full maintenance with four hour and our next business day on site service. Now a reputed growing service program is further strengthened with our [inaudible] and we have seen an excellent response from customer to this new business solutions by extending our business model to provide a total solution and service, many new doors of opportunity have opened for Super Micro and we expect them to drive a more direct business globally. Slide seven please. On our hardware side our Twin family grew strongly last quarter with FatTwin leading the way with over 20% growth year-over-year. Now FatTwin platform available in 150 models and 140 combinations is the most of higher multipurpose server architecture on the market optimized for high volume datacenter decrement. We also saw strong growth in our other three important including our recently launched Twin Pro series. The Twin Pro is our only solution on the market today that over 3.0 and storage options boosting our performance edge over competition. The Twin family makes up the largest supporter in our solutions which was up 50% year-over-year. On other system solutions storage and GPU/Xeon Phi Optimized has grown consistently with 32% and 42% year-over-year growth respectively. As we have provided a variety of storage in HPC solutions to many customers, we are also getting a lot of interest on our recently launched high density low power MicroBlade architecture. This supports our 112 nodes Atom or 28 node in 6U Form Factor it features up to four, 2.5 gigabit per second SPn[ph] sort of networking with 10 gigabit per second version coming soon. Now extremely power and closely efficient MicroBlade architecture with the highly dynamic SDN will play an important role in our revenue stream for our coming quarters. Looking ahead, we are consistently creating new and exciting products as we are one of the premier innovators in the market. With our new software products and service offerings we are getting much to provide optimized computer solutions to enterprise customers, product development and innovation of next generation server storage and networking products is well underway. We are also executing to launch a brand new system architecture that will further optimize system for to-date and cloud applications. Now is definitely an inspiring time for us and our customers as we stand at the age of technology. In summary, Super Micro had a second straight quarter of record revenue and earnings. As I have said before, our aggressive investment in global foundation and strong product development enables Super Micro to achieve much higher revenue, profitability and momentum in 2014. We are off to a great start for calendar 2014 and we are focused on reaching the 2 billion run rate target. For most specifics on the third quarter, let me turn it over to Howe. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record 373.8 million, up 34.4% from the same quarter year ago and up 4.9% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in service solutions sales particularly in the Internet data center customer. We are also benefiting from the technology transition to Ivy Bridge as well as new offerings of FatTwin storage and GPU Xeon 5 based solutions. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily due to strength in the U.S. in particular in the Internet data center customers. Asia and Europe were down on a seasonal basis. The strength of our innovative and broad solutions and the ranking of the technology refresh cycle, outweigh for us, what is traditionally a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Slide nine, turning to product mix, the portion of revenue from server systems was 50.1% of total revenues which was up from 41.8% the same quarter year ago, and from 48.8% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,600 per unit, which is up from $2,100 last year and down from $2,700 last quarter. We shipped approximately 72,000 servers in the third quarter and 1,116,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenue. Internet data center revenue was 15.9% which was an increase from 12.9% in the prior quarter and from 10.8% in the prior year. The increase was primarily in the U.S. as we benefit from the expansion of the cloud and those looking for optimized solutions. 54.5% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 51.9% from distributors and resellers. Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was 57.5 million, up 47% from 39.1 million in the same quarter last year, and up 3.9% from 55.3 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 15.4% up, from 14.1% a year ago and down from 15.5% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 18.7% a year ago and 18.1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from stronger vendor relationships, increased utilization from the Taiwan facility also impart, by higher Internet data center sales. Sequentially gross margins were down due to seasonally quarter for the industry and higher Internet data center sales, also impart by higher utilization of our facilities more complete server solutions and increase purchasing power. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were 33.2 million up from 30.8 million from the same quarter year ago, and from 32.3 million sequentially. The percentage of revenues operating expenses was 8.9%, down from 11.1% year-over-year and from 9.1% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily on R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support development of our solutions. Sequentially operating expenses were higher due to trade show expenses associated with [inaudible] as well as higher personnel expenses due to additional R&D resources. The company\u2019s headcount increased by 60 sequentially through 1,721 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging investment has made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our solutions portfolio. Operating profit was 24.3 million up 192.9% from 8.3 million a year ago and by 5.6% from 23 million sequentially. On percentage basis operating margin was 6.5% up from 3% a year ago and from 6.4% sequentially. Net income was 17.8 million or 4.8% of revenues, up 77.1% from 10 million a year ago and 11.8% from 15.9 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.37 per share, up from $0.23 per share a year ago and up from $0.35 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in third quarter was 48,103,000 shares. The tax rate for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 26.4% compared to negative 23.1% a year ago and 30.5% sequentially. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the release of tax liabilities in the current quarter. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31% for the fourth quarter which is up from 24.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase, reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in June of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis slide 13, cash and cash equivalence for short and long term investments were 104.4 million, up 11.8 million from 92.6 million in the prior quarter, and up 7.7 million from 96.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a negative 8.7 million, primarily due to increased accounts receivables to support the growth of revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by 20.9 million to 118 million due to record revenues mentioned above. DSOs was 41 days, an increase of three days from 38 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by 4.2 million to 295.1 million to support the increased and forecasted of revenues for a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Days and inventories was the same at 83 days, Accounts payable was 205.2 million which was comparable to prior quarter. Days payable outstanding increased by one day to 58 days. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 66 days, an increase of two days and 64 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During this third quarter we grew at a seasonally weak quarter for the industry due to our optimized solutions and leveraging the foundation we have built over the past few years. As we enter the fourth quarter, which is seasonally the strong quarter for the industry, we continue to leverage a foundation that we have built to continue to drive our growth and profitability. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2014 in a range of 370 million to 410 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35 to $0.41 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook at/or any portion thereof at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howe. Again last quarter was another record high quarter of revenues and earnings for Super Micro and it is a strong start to calendar 2014. With our leadership in innovation and market [inaudible] global capability grows. I\u2019m confident that calendar 2014 we have a significant year of revolution and growth for Super Micro. Operator, as at this time we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. I will go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on another solid quarter. I guess the first question and I have a follow up is on the gross margin line. When I look at the 15.4% gross margin that you guys just reported, obviously you saw record high contribution from your total systems revenue which typically would help that gross margin lines. So I think could you guys give us some color on the various different puts and takes particularly the mix of Internet data center vertical? And how that impacts that weighted gross margin relative to the mix of the total system business increasing? Charles Liang : Yeah thank you for the question. Yeah, indeed recently our operation in Asia is pretty ready and strong and that\u2019s why we start to get into more aggressively in cloud and Internet data centers. So, basically we gain pretty much one in U.S. one new in Asia and another new in Europe. So those high scale data center and Internet business kind of good for our long term and short term is we kind of had to sacrifice our profit a little bit. But long term, we will get benefit from those economical scale. Aaron Rakers : I guess just kind of follow up on that then, is there any kind of help that you can give us with regards to the differential between the gross margin of that Internet data center vertical as that seems to be obviously a growth driver here as we continue to move forward relative to I guess you call it the traditional enterprise business the non-Internet data center vertical? Charles Liang : Indeed we are also growing very strongly in traditional enterprise market as officially now site service is fully available and our management is also available. So we are also growing aggressively in enterprise customer and that\u2019s why our overall profit margin won\u2019t be too bad I mean. Aaron Rakers : Okay. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys hear me? Charles Liang : Yes, we can. Operator : Yes. Mark Kelleher : Okay. Just wanted to follow up on that question I\u2019m going to ask sort of the same question in a different way. In the past you set some gross margin expectation should we look at some of the gross margin sort of plateau in here as the increase in data center continues to take more as a percentage of revenue? What are the longer term gross margin expectations right now? Charles Liang : I guess the most important we try to mix it up it continues to grow strongly and with that we are selectively have some activity account with relatively lower margin and Howe may be you could add something. Howard Hideshima : Yeah. Mark this is Howard. Also again we\u2019re still holding to our targets. We are driving towards that and quite frankly, like I said, we always said that it wouldn\u2019t happen in a linear fashion per se. And you have to remember that this is a seasonally weak quarter and if you look back historically, you\u2019ll find that there is always margin pressure during the March quarter if you go back a couple of years. Mark Kelleher : Okay. And as a follow up question how about an update on the Taiwan manufacturing? Where are we in utilization there and are you going to want to put another line there? Howard Hideshima : We\u2019re kind of pleased it\u2019s still behind schedule we are pleased as Charles mentioned it\u2019s over 50% of our utilization at this point. We\u2019re looking to drive and keep on filling up that facility and utilize the benefits it\u2019s providing to us. Charles Liang : And we believe that within one year, our utilization in Taiwan facility should be almost 100% so that\u2019s pretty positive side for us. Mark Kelleher : Okay great. Congratulations again on the quarter. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham and Company. Glenn Hanus : Good afternoon. So, on the revenue you did roughly 40 million of revenue upside in the quarter. Can you give us a little more color where did that upside come from? Obviously North America was strong Internet Data center did you may be have it sounds like you have couple of new large customers little more color on that. And then on the guide, I mean certainly good guidance but seasonally you might have stronger sequential growth into the June quarter. So was there some revenue perhaps that went into March did deal or two or something and then is little less in June can you give us some color around that? Charles Liang : Yeah basically, so you know June traditionally our strong quarter and if I believe we\u2019re the singular right? So except again that is why we say we start to be more aggressive in the Internet data center. However, we are also growing strongly in our enterprise accounts. So overall our optimizing should be consistently improving. Glenn Hanus : All right. I\u2019ll take it up offline. Thank you very much. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we\u2019re looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the Super Micro third quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenue was $428.1 million. It's 14.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 32.8% higher year-over-year. This result was a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $19.4 million or 9.2% higher quarter-over-quarter and 71.8% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40 per diluted share compared to $0.37 last quarter or $0.26 last year. Slide 5, please. In my comments today, I would like to discuss our results last quarter as well as our achievements during the past fiscal year. Last quarter, we achieved record high revenue, which was 32% -- 32.8% higher than last year. This strong fourth quarter performance helped to push our full year revenue to $1.47 billion, representing 26.2% growth over last year. This quarter also marks the third quarter in a row of record revenue, which demonstrates significant momentum in our growth trend. This strong upward momentum is the highest in the industry where our growth rate is multiple times that of the industry's. It also indicates that we continue to take market share. More than ever, our partners choose our platform system solution due to quality and performance optimization. Last quarter, our server system contributed 55.2% of our total revenue, which is a record high for system growth. Of that, 48.1% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and direct customers. Cloud and Internet Data Center account for 17.8% of sales, which is an increase of 150% over last year and approximately 28% higher than last quarter. Indeed, these results indicate that we have been able to win the opportunities in this competitive market with optimized products. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 58.6%, Asia was 19.6%, and Europe was 18.5% of total sales. Our growth in North America continued to be strong and very consistent due to our improved economical scale; DCO, our Data Center Optimized, product line; and sales folks on our key market segment in the U.S. We also see a strong growth trend in storage virtualization, cloud and Internet Data Center demands. Asia business improved from last quarter, mainly due to stronger growth in China, and our Taiwan facility is about 50% utilized and increasing. As for product, storage had been a consistent strong product line for all fiscal 2014. We have very strong storage product line, and we have many partners who have leading software -- storage software solutions that run in Super Micro's system products. Last quarter, our storage revenue grew 54% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, which accounts to about 10% of our total revenue this past year. GPU solutions were also strong and continue with 75% higher growth year-over-year and 13% higher sequentially. Our FatTwin product line had been the strongest with over 150% higher revenue than last year and 107% higher sequentially. Slide 6 please. 2014 had been a year of remarkable revenue growth, product innovation, foundation improvement and double capacity. It was a breakout year in revenue for Super Micro with annual growth of 26%, mainly due to strong products optimized for storage, HPC, virtualization, cloud data center. Our server premium [ph] product provide a best-of-feed solution that is optimized for fabrication, for power saving, for density and for cost. Super Micro grows faster than the industry because we are the only player in the industry that had the widest array of premium product to deliver the best, and exactly what the industry wants. Whether our product is in the Super Micro branded product or presented in the name of our partner, Super Micro is the leader in application optimization. In 2014, our product innovation and [indiscernible] were the most extensive in the world. We upgrade our Twin product line, which is our TwinPro architecture. This is the power industry's first SaaS 3.0 storage, NVMe-accelerated PCI-E SSD and titanium-level efficiency power supply in a data center-optimized platform. We continue to extend the application-optimized SKU for our FatTwin architecture. We extended our leadership for high-density micro server solutions by launching our 24-node 3U MicroCloud for data center Web hosting and cloud application. We also launched the industry's densest server, the MicroBlade, with the 112-node Atom or 28-node DPGU [ph] in the 6U form factor. Lastly, our GPU solutions is ranked the #1 in the Green500 supercomputer rankings for being the most powerful and the most power efficient. Our rapid growth in 2014 was also enabled by the improvement of our global foundation. Our Asia Science & Technology Park in Taiwan supports our Asia and European sales rep much quicker than before. On the domestic front, we have purchased a new 36-acre land with a 300,000 square-feet building within 5 minutes from our current campus. We are converting the existing building on that new purchase to logistics and system integration facilities, and they are about ready to deploy. This additional facility will enable us to speed up our business growth in North America. And in the next few years, we will develop this land into one of the biggest IT research and production facilities in the U.S. We call this new campus the Super Micro Green Computing Park. Page 7, please. Looking ahead, Intel will launch our new process technology, Haswell, in September. We have been working on our early shipping program with key customers for the past few months, and we are well prepared. Our X10, the industry's strongest server and storage product lines, they are fully optimized for the new processor. In fact, we have been successfully deploying thousands of these new X10 system to early adopter through Intel early shipping program. Mostly importantly, we were, again, the industry leader in term of product base innovation, which is our leading come-to-market advantage. They are the core strengths of Super Micro, and we expect to exploit this opportunity to its max. To further exploit this technology transition, we are also ready to deliver a new server architecture that we called the Ultra. The Ultra architecture that its name suggests is a server architecture that delivers the highest performance and the most flexibility than any other servers on the market today. We have removed the traditional I/O rigidity and bottlenecks by developing a set of new multifunction I/O modules. This allow us to have a much higher performance on barriers, networking and storage solutions. Moreover, the Ultra architecture features a unique design, which achieved much impressive PUE performance with the minimum cooling fans needed to operate the most high-performance system combination [ph]. Ultra architecture's competitive feature will set Super Micro apart from its competition when we -- when our new generation of server hit the market this quarter. As we get into fiscal 2015, we are more excited than ever before. We see a great opportunity to speed up our growth momentum and reach that $2 billion annual run rate this year. Our foundation continue to get stronger as we start to utilize our Green Computing Park space and Taiwan facility for higher operation capacity and efficiency. Together with our upcoming Haswell base that will launch with yet again the first-to-market advantage, we are certain our business will leap into the next level in the very near future. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 8. Revenue was a record $428.1 million, up 32.8% from the same quarter a year ago and 14.5% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales, particularly in our cloud, Internet Data Center customers. Storage and FatTwin continue to benefit from the market's desire for more dense and power-efficient solutions. More importantly, as our solutions become more complex, the value of our engineering and the optimized solutions we can create from our building block approach is continuing to gain momentum. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to our strength in the U.S., in particular in the cloud, Internet Data Center customers. Asia continues to grow while Europe was down. The strength of our innovative and broad solutions, coupled with our strong engineering, continue to draw more customers looking for help in bringing the best solutions to fit their needs. Slide 9. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 55.2% of total revenues, which was up from 47.4% the same quarter a year ago and from 50.1% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $3,300 per unit, which is up from $2,400 last year and up from $2,600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 72,000 servers in the fourth quarter and 1,114,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet Data Center revenues was 17.8%, which was an increase from 15.9% in the prior quarter and from 9.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily in the U.S. as we benefit from the expansion of the cloud and those looking for optimized solutions. 58.6% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 51.9% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $66.6 million, up 43.9% from $46.3 million in the same quarter last year and up 15.8% from $57.5 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.6%, up from 14.4% a year ago and from 14 -- 15.4% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis points charged to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing 15.7% of total cost of goods sold compared to 17% a year ago and 14.4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from strong vendor relationships, increased utilization of our Taiwan facility, offset in part by higher cloud, Internet Data Center sales. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to more complete server solutions and increased purchasing power, offset in part by higher cloud, Internet Data Center sales. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $37.2 million, up from $31.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and from $33.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.7%, down from 9.7% year-over-year and from 8.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support the broadening of our solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses for additional R&D resources as well as product development expenses as we prepare for the transition to Grantley. The company's headcount increased by 148 sequentially to 1,869 total employees. Operating profit was $29.4 million, up by 94.5% from 15.5 -- $15.1 million a year ago and by 21.2% from $24.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.9%, up from 4.7% a year ago and from 6.5% sequentially. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investment in our solution portfolio to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $19.4 million or 4.5% of revenue, up 71.8% from $11.3 million a year ago and 9.2% from $17.8 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.40 per share, up from $0.26 per share a year ago and up from $0.37 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 48,977,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was -- on a non-GAAP basis was 33.6% compared to 24.7% a year ago and 26.4% sequentially. The rate was higher than last quarter due to additional tax liabilities associated with R&D expenses in the current quarter as well as higher profits. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 35.1% for the first quarter, which is up from 31.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase from last year reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in June of 2013 and the release of tax liabilities in that quarter. The R&D tax credit has not been reinstated as of yet, which we have estimated to have caused about 2.2% reduction in our tax estimated current rate. In addition, if the tax credit is reinstated retroactively, like it has in the past, we will have about 1.2% reduction in our overall annual tax rate. This effectively reduces the tax rate on an annual basis to about 31.7%. Other items such as lapse of statute of limitations and an increase or decrease in profits have affected our tax rate as well in the past. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 30.6%. The company continues to work on our tax planning as we expand overseas. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment were $99.6 million, down $4.8 million from $104.4 million in the prior quarter and up $3.9 million from $95.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $9.7 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support continued growth of the revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by $30.7 million to $212.7 million due to record revenues mentioned above. Sales DSOs was 42 days, an increase of 1 day from 41 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $20.7 million to $315.8 million to support the forecasted revenue and the transition to Grantley-based products. Days in inventory was 77, a decrease of 6 days from 83 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $219.4 million, which was 53 days, a decrease of 5 days from 58 days in the prior quarter. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 66 days, and which is the same as the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the fourth quarter, we continued our growth, leveraging a foundation in product engineering and delivery we have built over the past few years to provide optimized solution to our customers. As we enter the first quarter, which is a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, we look to take advantage of our time to market by providing the broadest breadth of solutions as a new technology refresh cycle is about to start to continue to drive our growth and profitability. Therefore, the company currently expects to have sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2014, in a range of $395 million to $435 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 34% and 77% in revenue and EPS, respectively, from the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. Now fourth quarter was a record high for Super Micro, with growth at 26.2% higher year-over-year and that our pace is more than 4x the industry's growth rate. We start a new fiscal year with the strongest product line in our history and with our global foundation and operation ready for a big jump. I am fully confident that 2015 will be a breakthrough year for Super Micro. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : The first question, if I can, just talk a little bit about the Internet Data Center vertical. I know you guys talked about there not being any kind of 10% customers in total, but maybe you can address whether or not there's any kind of customer concentration dynamics to that vertical and kind of dovetailing that with the fact that I think last quarter, you talked about, in particular, 3 new large data center opportunities that you had won. Where do we stand in terms of the progression of those opportunities in terms of the results that you just reported? Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you, Aaron. A very good question. Yes, most of our customers continue to buy more product from us, but at the same time, we're also growing our overall revenue. So I would like to say we will grow more large customer and at the same time grow -- each customer will grow. Howard Hideshima : Adding to that, Aaron. Again, as I mentioned, we had no 10% customers. That vertical is going well for us per se. And like I said, we talk about the 3 data centers that we won a couple of quarters ago. Those are going well for us. So there are new relationships that are doing well for us. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, when we look at the gross margin line, I think some investors ask, why do we not maybe see a little bit more leverage there give the strong systems mix? Can you talk about the puts and takes relative to the gross margin, be it the mix relative to systems versus the components business, and how much of an offset we should consider that Internet Data Center piece of that as that grows going forward in terms of maybe a downward pressure point on gross margin? Howard Hideshima : Yes, Aaron, I think, like I said, while the mix of Internet Data Center business went up to 17.8% this quarter from last quarter, I think you'll see that our gross margins overall increased. I think we've been saying all along that it's important for us to be in that Internet Data Center vertical because, while it is competitive, it helps us increase our purchasing power. So that -- if you can take a look at an example, that will more than offset any of the downward pressure that we had during that quarter because it really reflects onto the rest of our business as far as that purchasing power. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Just to follow up on Aaron's question, where do you think those gross margins can go? I mean, there were a number of levers that work in your favor in that quarter. We talked about the server mix up, but the ASPs were up. The Taiwan manufacturing was doing very well. So there's a number of things coming into play here. Where do you think the gross margins can trend over time? Charles Liang : Yes, I believe they still have a lot of room for us to grow gross margin. For example, our Asia facility today, its utilization rate is only about 15%, and we see it will continue to grow strongly. And similarly, we're just purchasing a some would say [ph], more greenhills campus, 36-acre. We just started to use that new facility. So we already paid for the facility, and we just start to use that facility. Again, that utilization rate will continue to grow as well. So all of those will help us. By the way, the new Intel Grantley platform, as you know, we always have the time-to-market advantage. And we already shipped thousands of our systems to early deployment customer, and during this month -- next month, we will ship kind of pretty good volume on our early deployment product. So all of those will help us in the gross margin and revenue. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : I know, Howard, you, in the past, have given us kind of a range. Can we do 16%, 17%? 17%, 18%? 15%, 16%? Where would you peg it? Howard Hideshima : We've kept the range the same, Mark. Right now, it's 16% to 18%. We think we have some great opportunities, and we'll keep that range. But also, we have some great opportunities to grow our business, as we talked about and Charles talked about. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : All right. Just kind of as a follow-up to that, your ASPs on those servers jumped pretty dramatically. What's going on there? Charles Liang : We focus on really high-end, high-efficiency system. For those systems, indeed, each system customer had [ph] also memory and hard drive. And that may be one of the key factors. That's why our ASP grew a lot, especially virtualization. People need a huge memory and hard drive. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Just 2 quick questions. First, with Grantley coming occasionally ahead of these processor rollouts, you do see a pause. Clearly, you guys have not seen a pause in the previous generation. Would you expect it to be a very back-end loaded quarter as a result of this launch? Or any updates on just linearity with the new product launch coming in September. Charles Liang : Yes, the new product happened very smoothly this time so far, and we already -- that's why I mentioned we already have 1,000 now deployed already, and many more thousand is coming this month and next month. So we can see -- we do believe a smooth transition. And that transition will be strong, I believe, at this moment. Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : Excellent, okay. And then lastly, on the Taiwan facility, obviously the utilization continues to improve, and that's good. But Howard, just to understand the leverage and the model, can you give us a sense on what the flow-through would be on a 60%-type utilization or a 75%-type utilization rate? And is that your goal? Do you have a goal exiting fiscal '15 or what that target utilization might be? Howard Hideshima : We said in the past that we wanted to get to about 100% utilization in the next year. That's been said before on the 3 lines we have. Remember, we have capacity for 6 to 8 lines there. So again, we have room to grow, and we're looking at adding additional lines there. As far as sizing the benefit from that, again, labor costs and those types of things are about 1/3 less than what they are here. So it can be -- we call it as one of the biggest levers for us in helping our gross margins. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go back to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So one of the opportunities that I think has presented itself to Super Micro is the pending transaction of Lenovo acquiring the IBM assets on the x86 server side. So maybe you can just update us on where you stand, whether or not you've seen any benefit that you've seen on your business from that. And in particular, maybe you can just give us a quick update of where you stand relative to traction within the traditional enterprise space for Super Micro. Charles Liang : Yes, it's a very good question. We start to see some customer come to us because they really want the best quality and on-site service kind of capability. And naturally, we are most positive for them. So we do see some change coming, and it looks like this trend will continue. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then final question for me. Some discussion around gross margin and leverage. Howard, I'd like to maybe understand how you think about free cash flow. What do you think the right free cash flow -- or maybe a better question, right working capital metrics would look like on a going-forward basis? Just any kind of framework of how you're thinking about those metrics will be helpful as it relates to that free cash flow story. Howard Hideshima : Aaron, if I look back at this past year, I guess we were fairly good at managing our free cash flow. The only negative that we had, I think, we were about $16 million negative for the year or so on our free cash flow. And quite frankly, that was due to the purchase of the property that we had that we financed about half of it and we -- and then we purchased it out of our cash with the rest of it. So again, that wasn't bad given that we were able to support the growth of the business. And I think that's where our focus is going to be, not to -- to keep leveraging the business, and quite frankly, grow our business and then reinvest that working capital, the money that we'll be generating from our profits, back into the business to continue this growth. That's our focus. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the Grantley launch. What percentage of revenue in the quarter was Ivy Bridge? Is Ivy Bridge still expanding as a percent of revenue? Howard Hideshima : Yes, Mark. Actually, it grew for us about -- I think it was 17% quarter-over-quarter and is still expanding for us. It's still important for us going forward, and we still see some long life in that going forward for many quarters. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Right. So my understanding is that the ramp-up of a new architecture kind of takes many quarters to happen, and we shouldn't be looking for some spike because of Grantley launching in the September quarter, is that accurate? Howard Hideshima : No, that's accurate. Operator : And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2014 Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. We are pleased that our first quarter revenue was $443.3 million. It\u2019s 3.6% higher quarter over quarter, and 43.5% higher year over year. This result was another record high for Super Micro.  Non-GAAP net income was $23.2 million, or 19.5% higher quarter over quarter and 134.8% higher compared to last year. Super Micro\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $0.40 last quarter or $0.22 last year. Please turn to slide five. Last quarter, we achieved our fourth consecutive record high revenue, which was 43.5% higher than last year. Many growth factors contributed to these impressive achievements. First and foremost, our services contributed 57.7% of our total revenue, which is another record high for our system business. 44% of our business last quarter came from our building block solution, OEMs, and direct customers. [unintelligible] solution and storage [unintelligible] were significant barriers, while internet data center [unintelligible]. Moreover, we introduced our brand new X10 generation of products based on the latest Intel Haswell [DP] processors. We exercised our engineering expertise and turned it into a first to market product advantage from early delivery programs. The [unintelligible] revenue in North America was 54.9%. Asia was 19.9%, and Europe was 20.2% of total sales. Our growth in North America continued to be strong, where Asia grew slightly and Europe [rebounded] from last quarter. Notably we [unintelligible] the green computing park project in the heart of Silicon Valley last quarter. The expansion will provide additional production and operation capacity as we expect more aggressive growth from the domestic market in the near future. As I have mentioned before, systems solutions have grown to dominate our revenue because of our optimized design for unique customers in areas like storage, cloud, HPC, and high-density multiple node systems. Last quarter, our storage revenue grew 63% year over year, and 1% sequentially. GPU Xeon Phi solutions continued their momentum with 95% higher growth year over year and 52% higher sequentially. Multiple node systems such as MicroCloud grew 60% year over year and 71% sequentially. Our Twin solutions, including FatTwin, TwinPro and [Twinsquared] product lines grew 73% year over year and 23% sequentially. On these trends, we are pleased to see the performance per [watt] and computing density continue to [ship] the [unintelligible] as we anticipated. In addition, our service, software, and networking solution offers are growing consistently to help us win new total solution customers. Slide six [unintelligible]. Continuing our momentum from our X9 generation of products, we launched our [unintelligible] X10 Haswell [unintelligible] product line that this year Intel\u2019s [IPF]. Along with the launch, we unveiled our industry leading brand new Haswell architecture, which delivers the highest performance per watt and most flexible I/O on the market today. These [unintelligible] service can support the latest [unintelligible] processors, up to 165 watt [TDP], I mean thermal design power, 1.5 terabytes of [CD] alpha memory intended for [dims], plus [unintelligible], which I will discuss later for increased storage bandwidth and energy efficiency, 96% plus [titanium] level power supplies. We removed our traditional I/O rigidity and bottlenecks by developing a set of new multiple function I/O modules that can accommodate full 10G [unintelligible], full 10G [SLP plus], full 40G Ethernet, multiple channel [FBR] [InfiniBand] options and beyond. Also included in this launch was our [unintelligible] Memory Express technology [unintelligible] NVMe. It\u2019s the next [big leap] in storage performance and Super Micro is again the first to implement this latest technology and deliver it to the market. Our testing indicates that the NVMe system provides almost six times the bandwidth and approximately 7 times the latency improvement over standard SSDs. Moreover, we have the most extensive hot swappable NVMe product lines in the industry, and we are shipping to our customers today. As our technical expertise matured, we want to offer more value beyond just hardware systems. Many years of preparation and investment have gone into Super Micro\u2019s cloud solution business. Our cloud solutions consist of complete racks of servers, switches, and storage, combined with software and service intended for both large scale public and small scale private clouds. These solutions are essentially plug and play with complete care by Super Micro, which represents our continuous effort to provide the customer with optimized high-value turnkey solutions with peace of mind. To summarize, we have begun fiscal 2015 with a very strong first quarter results, which carries our faster pace momentum toward an exciting new year. Our strong global foundation is based on years of innovative product leadership and expanding worldwide operations. We continue to see opportunity in the server and storage market by leveraging our unique [unintelligible] approach, and now delivering optimized, complete solutions, with service and software. We believe this new enhanced business capability will [unintelligible] our strong growth, momentum, and gain market share. For more specifics on our first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items, on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter\u2019s income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record $443.3 million, up 43.5% from the same quarter a year ago and up 3.6% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in service solutions sales, particularly in our Twin solutions, which we pioneered over seven years ago. [unintelligible] GPU products continue their strong growth as well.  On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia again leading the way at 60.9% growth followed by the U.S. at 38.9% and Europe at 25.8%. The sequential increase in revenue in a seasonally weak quarter was primarily due to our strength in Europe and Asia. Our Twin products led the way, along with GPU and MicroCloud. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 57.7% of total revenues, which was up from 46.4% the same quarter a year ago and from 55.2% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3,600 per unit, which is up from $2,600 last year and up from $3,300 last quarter. We shipped approximately 71,000 servers in the first quarter and 1,254,000 subsystems and accessories.  We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud and internet data center revenue was 13.7%, which was a decrease from 17.8% in the prior quarter and an increase from 8.3% in the prior year. 54.9% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 56% from our distributors and resellers.  Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $69.4 million, up 47.6% from $47 million in the same quarter last year and up 4.2% from $66.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7%, up from 15.2% a year ago and from 15.6% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.5% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 17.3% a year ago and 15.7% sequentially. The year over year increase in gross margin resulted from increased complete server sales, strong vendor relationships, and increased utilization of our Taiwan facility, offset in part by higher cloud internet data center sales. Sequentially, gross margins was up due to more complete server solutions and lower cloud internet data center sales.  Slides 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $34.8 million, up from $32.4 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $37.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expense was 7.9%, down from 10.5% year over year and from 8.7% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year, primarily in R&D, as we invest in personnel expenses to support the development of our solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to a $1.9 million of value-added tax refund from Taiwan, which we received during the quarter. The company\u2019s headcount increased by 62 sequentially to 1,931 total employees.  Operating profit was $34.6 million, up by 136.5% from $14.6 million a year ago and by 17.6% from $29.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.8%, up from 4.7% a year ago and from 6.9% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities in front of us while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $23.2 million or 5.2% of revenues, up 134.8% from $9.9 million a year ago and 19.5% from $19.4 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.46 per share, up from $0.22 per share a year ago and up from $0.40 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 50,305,000.  The tax rate for the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32.7% compared to 31.7% a year ago and 33.6% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially due to an increase in profitability overseas, which had the effect of lowering our overall corporate tax rate.  We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 33.5% for the December quarter. This rate assumes no reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, slide 13, cash, cash equivalents, and short and long term investments were $120.2 million, up $20.6 million from $99.6 million in the prior quarter and up $6.1 million from $114.2 million in the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, free cash flow was a positive $24.3 million, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable, offset in part by increase in inventory to support the continuing growth of revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by $18.4 million to $194.4 million. DSOs was 42 days, which was the same in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $25.7 million to $341.5 million to support the forecasted revenue increase and a transition to Grantley-based products. Days in inventory was 81, an increase of four days from 77 in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $222.6 million, which was 54 days, an increase of one day from 53 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 69 days, which is three days higher than in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the first quarter, we continued our strong growth, leveraging the foundation we have built over the years and executing our strategy to provide optimized solutions to our customers. As we enter the second quarter a new technology refresh cycle has started, with many new technologies being introduced. We look to take advantage of our engineering and the broad breadth of solutions to drive our strong growth and profitability. Therefore, the company expectations net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2014 in a range of $440 million to $480 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.44 to $0.50 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 29% and 57% in revenue and EPS respectively, from the prior year. It\u2019s currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. The first quarter was another record high for Super Micro, with growth of 43.5% higher year over year. And that, again, outpaced more than multiple times the industry growth rate. Through our innovative product strategy, quality and service, we are in a unique position to take market share, grow revenue, and achieve strong operating income. With that, we are on track to reach our $2 billion run rate milestone very soon. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll go first to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Wanted to look at gross margins from a couple of angles. First of all, can you tell us what percent of revenue in the quarter or of server sales came from the Grantley launch? Is it still very small? Howard Hideshima : Yes, it\u2019s just ramping now. However, we\u2019re seeing that the ramp is probably about over 50% better than what it was when the Sandy Bridge launch occurred during a similar period. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : And that\u2019s carrying higher gross margins, right? Howard Hideshima : Yes. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : And your tilt toward servers is a benefit to gross margins, right? Howard Hideshima : It depends on the mix of the servers. During the quarter, we had, again, our storage solutions were a higher mix of our products, and they were more complete systems with that. So again, they can be somewhat lower at times too. It depends on the mix [unintelligible]. Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : With the internet data center revenue declining as a percentage of revenue in this quarter from last quarter, with Taiwan manufacturing increasing with the overall service percentage growing, and with Grantley into the mix, where can we get some more gross margin? I\u2019m surprised gross margin didn\u2019t boost up a little bit more. What\u2019s the pullback on that? What\u2019s the offset? Howard Hideshima : One thing you\u2019ve got to remember also, this is a seasonally weak quarter typically, and we\u2019ve gone through and grew right beyond those seasonal trends that we\u2019ve had in the past. It\u2019s usually a very competitive time in the industry. So again, that\u2019s part of, what you want to call a put or take, a take from the margin side of it. You know, the internet data center is historically competitive for us, and that is a positive for it when it goes down, but then you\u2019ve got the total server solutions mix and quite frankly, like I said, as we ship more complete server solutions, with regard to in the storage area, they can tend to drag our margin out a little bit because of higher content of hard disk drives and other types of components. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel : Going back to the gross margin discussion, it looks like, on the past six quarters, I think your average growth in storage has been over 40% year over year. Can you help us understand maybe that mix effect to the gross margin? How meaningful is storage today as a percentage of revenue, and is there a point in time where you start breaking that revenue stream out to give more visibility to that mix dynamic? Charles Liang : As you know, we ship more and more storage to special OEM accounts, and sometimes that cloud business is ramping up very well to us, including [unintelligible], and those are the sharing resource for private section or kind of some small public cloud. And the new technology [unintelligible] mentioned Haswell and together with our new architecture [unintelligible] rack. And coming soon, [unintelligible] Twin, that will contribute to higher profit margin. Aaron Rakers - Stifel : And then as a follow up, your Asia Pacific revenue growth was very impressive. Obviously there\u2019s been some changing dynamics in the competitive landscape with obviously Lenovo closing their transaction and then HP looking to leverage their partnership with Foxconn. Can you just remind us how meaningful China is with regard to your Asia Pacific growth and how you view the competitive landscape going forward relative to those two vendors? Charles Liang : Yeah, they have some impact for sure. However, our growth has been getting even in other countries like Japan, other countries in Asia. And the ramping of Haswell and [unintelligible] and total solution, that all help us move profit margin. Aaron Rakers - Stifel : The operating expense number was quite impressive, but I think I heard you say that there was a $1.9 million benefit from tax. I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s in the G&A line. With that said, how do we think about operating expense? Is that true, that\u2019s in that G&A line and that should be adjusted. And should we use that as kind of a run rate going forward, or do you expect opex to creep higher as we move out over the next several quarters? Howard Hideshima : It\u2019s actually in the R&D line, and it\u2019s a $1.9 million credit that came back. It\u2019s basically one single time item, so you would put that back, as you look forward, into our numbers. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : Going back to Grantley, just wanted to get a little more feedback, specifically with regard to the availability or lack thereof, I guess, of competing solutions relative to your own in the marketplace. Charles Liang : As you know, whenever there\u2019s a new technology refresh, we have a good chance. This time, Haswell especially is a big chance to us. [unintelligible] is a new [BDR] for more challenging technology. We introduced NVMe, especially pretty much in our first hot-swappable NVMe solution provider. All those will help us. And also, our micro [unintelligible] other storage product available one by one. So all those help. Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : And historically with these new processor launches, how long is I guess the gap between when the new processor is released and when that becomes a majority of your shipments? Charles Liang : It depends. Basically from Intel, we should launch [unintelligible] in the first six months for a nice period we have growing business, both revenue and profitability. Operator : And next, we have Mike Staiger with Roth Capital Partners. Mike Staiger - Roth Capital Partners : Just wanted to get a couple of thoughts on linearity within the quarter, and if your success here moving forward, should we think linearity would change historically speaking? Howard Hideshima : With regard to our linearity, it hasn\u2019t really changed. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re pretty linear throughout our quarter, throughout our history, indicating around 30% to 40%, that kind of spread in our business. However, we still are a turns type of business. Mike Staiger - Roth Capital Partners : And then just one follow up. You have a new partnership in this EVO : RAIL and it looks like you made a couple of announcements on that. Was there any contribution in the quarter from that particular program? Charles Liang : As you know, we have a complete storage and cloud solution [unintelligible], and that for sure will create a positive impact to our business. And it\u2019s happening now, and will be gradually growing. I would like to say it will take a few quarters or many quarters to ramp up. Operator : Up next we have Nehal Chokshi with the Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : The 79% year over year growth in systems, even when I take out the internet data center portion, which appears to account for all the direct increase, it looks like the systems grew 55% year over year. I believe this is all channel driven. Is this a correct interpretation of the data? If so, what is driving the strong traction in the channel? Is it all product driven, or is there some increasing brand awareness that you think is driving this as well. Howard Hideshima : Quite frankly, usually our service solutions go through to our direct customers and our OEM solutions customers. Again, that\u2019s where usually you see a lot of similarities to the percentages between our complete server solutions business and those other two. It goes less to the channel, although recently, again, you\u2019ve seen those percentages go higher than our distributor reseller business, because the channel is now starting to begin to take our complete server solutions, because, quite frankly, these systems are getting more complicated to put together, and for quality reasons and reliability reasons, they\u2019re looking for us to be putting the systems together. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of the opposite. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : And then with data management starting to move back to internal application servers, such as with the EVO : RAIL or the new [unintelligible], is there an opportunity for Super Micro to develop some IP here, or will it be Super Micro\u2019s strategy to be a partner of choice for the independent storage vendors who are seeking to move their data management stacks from external to internal to application server? Charles Liang : Yeah, we are doing both. One is working with our close partners. The other one is trying to develop some of our own IP as well. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : And then finally, could you talk about where\u2019s the utilization on the Taiwan facility? Howard Hideshima : About 50% now. Charles Liang : Yeah, but it will consistently grow, basically. Operator : And up next we have Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel : First of all, you\u2019ve talked about your $2 billion target the last couple of quarters now. Can you just remind us when you think you can attain that target? Charles Liang : I believe it\u2019s coming very soon. Maybe a quarter or a couple of quarters. Aaron Rakers - Stifel : . : Howard Hideshima : Like I said, last time I [attributed] about 4.4% to the R&D tax credit coming back. So again, you\u2019d be around 30 to just below that. Operator : And it appears at this time we have no further questions. I\u2019d like to the call back to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.",

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal second quarter. We are pleased to announce that we had another record quarter as our revenue have reached $503 million. It's 13.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 41.2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $33.5 million, or 44.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 110.9% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.65 per diluted share, compared to $0.46 last quarter or $0.35 last year. Please turn to slide five. As we have always believed for Washington technology combined with robust operation foundation translates into a strong revenue and growth and increased profitability for Super Micro. Last quarter we achieved our fifth consecutive a record high in revenue. With that we\u2019ll reach our goal of achieving $2 billion annual run rate and a continual improvement of our operation profit. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 57%, Europe was 18.2% and Asia was 15.6% of total sales. Our growth in USA continued to be the strongest worldwide. Last quarter, Europe grew in absolute revenue by lower as percentage. In Asia, we continued to see a great potential to grow as we increase our investment in local capacity and manpower. Last but not least, we saw increase in sales in countries such as Canada, Australia, Mexico and region of South America which boosted other region's revenue to 9.2%. Slide 6 please. For products, services have contributed 60.1% of our total revenue which is another record high for our system business. As I have mentioned before, more and more customer make our computer system integrated with software and management utilities offerings. Our computer system business ensures the best quality, one stop shop [TTM] [ph] advantages as well as on-site service for customer who need them, while our distribution and channel business also continue to grow in revenue. With that said, 50% of our business last quarter came from direct customers and OEMs of which 20.3% came from the Internet data center and card providers. Cloud solution demands were not very stronger last quarter. The previous quarter was the official launch of our X10 generation of products based on Intel, Haswell DP processors. We saw very good progress in adoption of this platform with 269% increase quarter-over-quarter in X10 product shipments. The new Ultra server architecture and hot swappable NVMe technology among others, has strongly encouraged customer to move ahead while we are still in the early stage of this technology transition. Now let's turn to market application optimize architecture and performance advantages are driving these significant growth and we see these trend to continue. On our key product line, storage continues to be a needed market vertical for Super Micro with 58% growth year-over-year. In addition to our tradition of storage offerings, we also work with leading technology partners to provide next generation hyper-converged storage solutions and high speed solutions. When we consider the broader storage market, the share of our storage revenue is in the range of 20% of our overall business. Storage indeed plays an important role of our total solution brand and we will continue to focus and invest in this growing segment. On the computing side, we addressed the increasing demand from cloud enterprise and data center industries with our optimized multi product line solutions, our twin architecture including FatTwin and TwinPro Solutions grew 75% year-over-year. We also saw approximately 50% year-over-year revenue increase with our MicroBlade, SuperBlade and MicroCloud products. All of these solutions, of our application optimization reached the maximum performance per watt and per dollars to each customer installation. Looking ahead, we are continuing to deepen our service, storage, technology spectrum by developing the most application optimized and exactly the most energy cost and service efficient platforms. Writing down the success of our storage business, we are developing a new super high-density 4U Rackmount solutions that will house up to 90.5 inch fast array or SATA [ph] hard driver risk with new inclusive features. We are also developing branding solution that can support even higher GPU or Xeon Phi density. And with our [no air] [ph] pre heated, no air pre heated means the system we will be able to achieve higher performance and systems stability with lower energy cost and PCO. This innovative solution will also support our future generations of GPU or Xeon Phi products even as power requirement increase. These two upcoming product line are just a few examples of many great technology now on the [horizon] [ph] from Super Micro. To summarize, we demonstrate industry leading growth by growing 41.2% year-over-year and reaching our milestone of 2 billion annual run rate to us. We will continue to leverage our advantages of leading technology, turn to market and product choice to provide exactly what customer want when they want it. To our customers, we are dedicated to be the one stop shop for basic service storage, total solutions on the market with [indiscernible] global service. To our shareholders, we are committed to deliver industry leading growth with improving profitability. For more specifics on the second quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items, on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue was a record $503 million, up 41.2% from the same quarter a year ago and 13.5% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in our service solutions sales, as partners continue to look for application optimized solutions utilizing the latest technology. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 59.7% growth followed by Europe at 7.8%. Although Asia was down 4.4%, we see continued opportunities for growth. Our other region category which includes country such as Canada, Australia, Mexico and South America, grew 380.1% as we are seeing increasing opportunities there as well. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonally strong quarter and to our strength and technology and broad product lines which allows us to see strong ramp in the Haswell products. Turning to products mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 60.1% of total revenues, which is up from 48.8% the same quarter a year ago and from 57.7% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3900 per unit, which is up from $2700 last year and up from $3600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 78,000 servers in the quarter and 1,115,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse customer base with over 700 customers and did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud and Internet data center revenues was 20.3%, which was an increase from 13.7% in the prior quarter and an increase from 12.9% in the prior year. 57% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 50% from our distribution and resellers. Slide 9. Non-GAAP gross profit was $84.7 million, up 53% from $55.3 million in the same quarter last year and up 22% from $69.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.8%, up from 15.5% a year ago and from 15.7% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 13.8% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 18.1% a year ago and 14.5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margins resulted from the ramp of new technology as well as from more complete server sales, increased scale of our business and higher utilization of our Taiwan facility. Sequentially gross margin was up through the ramp of the new technology, as well as increased scale of our business and more complete server solutions. Slide 10 and 11. Operating expenses were $38.6 million, up from $32.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $34.8 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 7.7%, down from 9.1% year over year and from 7.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis primarily in R&D, as we invest in personnel expenses to support the development of our solutions especially in preparation for new technology launch over the past year. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to a $1.9 million of value-added tax refund from Taiwan, which we received during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and higher compensation benefits and product development cost during the quarter as we continue to broaden our solution around the Haswell product launch. The company's headcount increased by 60 sequentially to 1,991 total employees. Operating profit was $46.1 million, up 100.4% from $23 million a year ago and by 33.1% from $34.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 9.1%, up from 6.4% a year ago and from 7.8% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities in front of us while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $33.5 million or 6.7% of revenues, up 110.9% from $15.9 million a year ago and 44.5% from $23.2 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis EPS was $0.65 per share, up from $0.35 per share a year ago and up from $0.46 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 51,645,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 27% compared to 30.5% a year ago and 32.7% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2014 which contributed about $0.05 to our EPS. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32.1% for the March quarter. This rate assumes no reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for calendar 2015. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, Slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents, and short and long term investments were $85.9 million, down $34.3 million from $120.2 million in the prior quarter and down $6.7 million from $92.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative $44 million, primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable increases described below. Slide 13. Accounts receivable increased by $64.4 million to $258.8 million to support the growth and revenue. DSOs was 41 days, a decrease of 1 day from 42 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $67.7 million to $409.2 million to support the transition to Haswell-based products. Days in inventories were 83 days, an increase of 2 days from 81 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $283.8 million, which was 56 days, an increase of two days from 54 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 68 days, which is 1 day lower than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the second quarter, we continued our see our strong growth, leveraging the foundation we have built over the years and executing our strategy to provide optimized solutions to our customers. As we enter the third quarter, a new technology refresh cycle has started, with many new technologies being introduced. We look to take advantage of our engineering and our broad breadth of solutions to drive our strong growth and profitability. However, it is the seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2015 in the range of $450 million to $500 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.46 to $0.52 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 27% and 32% in revenue and EPS respectively, from the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. The second quarter was another record high for Super Micro, with nearly growth of 41.2%. Even though this was one of our strongest quarter ever, we believe this is just the beginning of our long term growth as we continue to invest and to expand our foundation by growing professional stock and constructing advanced facility worldwide. On the strength of our technology transition, our optimized product line, and our overall market opportunity, we believe we will continue to grow at a multiple over the industry is known and our share in the competition. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers : Congratulations on the impressive quarter. I guess the first question is just to kind of touch on the topline revenue growth trajectory. You have crossed through the $2 billion annualized mark. Just curious how you are thinking about the next $1 billion. Are we seeing acceleration and do we kind of see -- are you anticipating any kind of sustained, call it, 20%-plus growth rate here as we move forward? And then maybe I will just throw my follow-up right in right away. How do we also think about that in the context of the operating margin target going forward? I think in the past, you have talked about 6% to 8% and now you have crossed through that with a 9%-plus number here this quarter. And then I will get back in queue. Thank you. Charles Liang : I believe our feel is, we are continuing to grow consistently especially the Haswell new transition just beginning. However, at Q1 again traditional Fed quarter not only try to conservative. However, for fiscal year 2015 I believe we hope we can achieve $2 billion strongly, - $2 billion for fiscal year. And as operation margin, I believe we will continue to grow. Howard, you may have more detail about it. Howard Hideshima : And just back to your question again at the mid point of our guidance even for this quarter, we\u2019re seeing about 27% growth from prior year. So again when you talk about that 20% that you threw out there, we were exceeding that with even our current guidance. With regard to the operating margin itself, we are continuing to look at way to leverage that obviously and take advantage of that and further improve our profits going forward. Operator : We'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Let me add my congratulations on a great quarter. Want to talk about the -- I guess we're moving down the income statement. Let's talk about the gross margins. That is a pretty significant step up sequentially. Can you talk about what elements were in there? I know you mentioned Grantley was in there. Maybe product mix. I know data centers was big in the quarter, but that carries lower gross margins. Can you just give us some puts and takes on the gross margin? And I would make the follow-up question, what percent of revenue in the quarter was Grantley servers? Thanks. Charles Liang : Couple of factor to improve our margin, one is new products line. As we just mentioned, Haswell CPU from Intel is still brand new. And with Haswell product line, we introduced some new architectural like [archwad] [ph] architecture, architecture rack and MicroBlade, NVMe or all those new technology we just made them available last quarter. So all those we are continuing to grow. And our [indiscernible] in Taiwan facility and our facility in USA was all improving. Howard Hideshima : And Mark I think I will just add to that, like I said, we have a number of factors that we talked about with regards to improving our growth margin this quarter we really hit upon a lot of those factors with regards on top of the new technology launched that Charles talked about, complete server solutions were very high at 60%, utilization at Taiwan, growth of our scale of our business, all of those contributed - not to mention services and support and software revenues. So a lot of things went well and in line in with what we were talking about as far as improving our margins going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Staying on the gross margin, can you give some directionality for the March quarter, given the strong performance in the December quarter? Howard Hideshima : Generally, seasonally it's a weak quarter and in past we've seen some margin softness in those quarters. So again, we\u2019ve taken that into account in our models with regards to the guidance that we provided. We do see some softness there. That could be offset by again strength in our technology, strength in growing our scale or whatever. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Great. And then congratulations on absolutely stunning growth, especially on the systems. Relative to the midpoint guidance of $460 million, there was a $43 million beat. Could you talk about the drivers of the upside? Was that all on a systems level or was there some component? And then can you drill down within the systems level, perhaps between hyperscale storage system, storage OEMs, and the disruption of the server market from the IBM selling its x86 business? Charles Liang : Yes. All the factors you mentioned pretty much all positive for our business. So we feel very optimistic to grow in the coming quarters especially the Haswell, again, like I just mentioned still new. And NVMe, that's a brand new technology, also much better performance and latency. So those product line will continue to grow our business for sure. Nehal Chokshi : Within the quarter, of those four things that I talked about, which ones was the biggest contributor to the year-over-year growth that you are seeing on the systems level? Howard Hideshima : It would be the, probably power transition. We saw very good ramp with regards to our Haswell-Grantley platforms during the quarter as Charles alluded to the 200 plus percent growth quarter-over-quarter. And that was very good to our positive improvement. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich Kugele : Good afternoon and congratulations again. I just wanted to ask a question about the inventory and then a follow-up with them. Is the inventory that you brought in raw components on the Grantley side? Were you concerned with availability? And then if you could just talk about when you expect the U.S. buildout of your local manufacturing and R&D to be completed and if you expect any type of material gross margin headwinds from that facility as it goes up? Howard Hideshima : Rich let's go with the last question first. With regard to the local facility we talked about Xeon Phi, the green computing part that we talk about here. As I mentioned before, we expect to spend about 21 million over the next year to facilitate that up and get the first building completed there during the next year. Again, do we see some drag on it? We will be bringing it up as we need it per say here, so we won't see much drag with regards to that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Just as a follow-up question. You mentioned the Taiwan manufacturing utilization. Sometimes you give us that number. Can you tell us what that utilization rate is? Charles Liang : Last quarter our utilization rate I believe was 57%. And looking forward, the utilization will continue to improve and I hope we can reach 80% not too far away. Mark Kelleher : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers : Just to follow on that comment, the 57% utilization, just to be clear, that is a utilization rate on your current existing product line -- your current existing manufacturing lines. Is the 80% also based on that? I guess what I am trying to understand is when do you fully expect to see the benefits of that in your gross margin line? Charles Liang : Yes 57% of that current and we believe to reach 80% hopefully in next quarter or two. And then we are looking for more space I mean after that. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then I think I had heard you mention that you did have a 10% customer in the quarter. Are you assuming that you continue to have a 10% customer in your current guidance or -- maybe any framework of what kind of customer that was, how do you expect that to progress as we go forward. Charles Liang : We believe this customer will continue to grow and we really hope that and have a strong confidence. At the same time we hope to grow more customer. So Super Micro has been a diversified company in term of product and customer base. Aaron Rakers : And was that in the Internet and cloud vertical? Charles Liang : Yes it was. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ethan Steinberg with SG Capital. Ethan Steinberg : Just a couple pieces I wanted to make sure I heard correctly. Did you say $2 billion, roughly, for the year, is what you were hoping for the fiscal year? Charles Liang : Yes, by end of June right. Ethan Steinberg : Yes. Okay. And then so 16.8% gross margin was a great breakout quarter. If you look at the new technology transition driving it and the other factors you talked about, it seems like all those are moving in the right direction. We still got a lot of the transition taking place even this quarter. I guess, can you help us think about directionally? Does that mean there is a decent amount more room for gross margin to move up as we get through this year? Charles Liang : I believe we will continue growing in term of operating margin but it won't be a big change. We've been relatively consistent to mostly growing I believe. Ethan Steinberg : Okay. And I was actually thinking gross margin. Would you say the same answer? Howard Hideshima : On the gross margin we are saying was, what we have is this great opportunity to drive growth in our business. So again, while we will look at the operating gross margins and preserve those as best we can, there are opportunities for us to take some market share and we do believe that that will translate to operating margin benefits as we\u2019ve seen over this past 18 months as we put out this model in the past year. Ethan Steinberg : Okay. But if Grantley goes up as a percentage quite a bit in the quarter you just guided for, wouldn't that have a pretty positive dynamic on the gross margin? Charles Liang : Possible, but at the same time we are also thinking about our kind of Q1 can be flat quarter and also a surprise for memory hard drive [indiscernible] a nonfactor. Ethan Steinberg : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : And we'll go to a follow up from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Looking at the balance sheet, Howard, could you run through the DSOs numbers again real quickly? Howard Hideshima : Sure. DSOs on account receivable were 41 days. The DSOs on inventory were 83 days and the accounts payable DSO was 56 days. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think you said it was flat for the DSOs on the accounts receivable. Is that right? Howard Hideshima : Accounts receivable were actually one down one day from 41 to - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Okay. Just trying to understand this, because it looks like the accounts receivable was up 33% quarter over quarter, yet the revenue overall was up 13% quarter over quarter. Presuming that my math is correct, is there a higher amount of days receivable for system level revenue relative to component revenue? Howard Hideshima : Never broken that out Nehal but quite - it's basically on the average. So we are competing on the average. That may help you on the calculation. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And it appears we have no other questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal year 2015 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

All of those documents are available from Investor Relations page or Super Micro\u2019s website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal third quarter. We are pleased to announce that we had another strong quarter of growth as our revenue reached $471.2 million. It's 6.3% lower quarter-over-quarter and 26.1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $24.9 million or 25.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 40.3% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $0.65 last quarter or $0.37 last year. Please turn to Slide five. We are pleased that during this traditionally [sought much] quarter, Super Micro again achieved strong year-over-year growth of 26.1% and our growth potential remained on track as we now head into the June quarter. Growth this quarter was primarily led by a high systems solution demand from key segment of storage, data center and card HPC and Enterprise. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 58.1%, Europe was 18.7%, Asia was 15.9%, and other region was 7.3% of total sales. Our geographic revenue and percentage remains consistent from our previous quarters, but the lower overall revenue was a result of West Coast Harbor Strike and some projects minor postponement. Fortunately, these issues had been resolved and we have confidence that our strong growth position will carry into the June quarter. Last dive into our products, our service system contribute 64.1% of our total revenue which is another record high for our system business. Our record growth in OEM and direct accounts 53.9% of total revenue was also in line with our strong system demand. In particular the internet data center and cost segment had maintained their recent growth momentum and reached 20.7% of total revenue. The service system business growth indicate our transition into a total solution provider have been successful. As I have mentioned before, more and more customers make our computer system integrated with software and management utility offerings. In addition, our faster growing service business had increased the value proposition of our total solution. With our expanding on size and upcoming online services, customers need new and current are attracted to our service capability as we enabled them to achieve better term to market, higher quality, lower TCO than our traditional hardware business model. This is the result of the significant investment we had made recently in both software and service business unit as they [have] quickly. But most importantly our software as a service gave our customer a piece of mind that exceeds the cost of the investment.  As for our optimized hardware solutions, the transition to our X10 generation of products based on Intel Haswell DP processors is ramping organically as expected, growing 26% quarter-on-quarter. In particular the new Ultra server architecture and hot swappable NVMe technology among others, has strongly encouraged customer to move ahead, also our twin architecture including FatTwin and TwinPro Solutions grew 43% year-over-year. Our mature FatTwin product line had undergo further optimization and refinement to serve different verticals. We now have all [30] battery variation of FatTwin models many of which are being deployed in hyper-scale open environment because of their high performance, high density, higher efficiency and lower TCO. This successful product proved that our [billion box] business model is a perfect match to create application optimized solutions in the emerging technologies. We are continuing to optimize the twin architecture with new and exciting feature [commission. Storage continues to be a leading market vertical with Super Micro with 57% growth year-over-year and up 7% sequentially which indicate a great product momentum in this seasonally third quarter. On a combined base our storage solution was almost 20% of total revenue. As I have mentioned last quarter we are partnering with technology providers to create the next generation of hyper-converged solutions such as EVO RAIL and Virtual SAN. We are also collaborating with partners on the new hybrid storage solutions for example [now recently announced] Ethernet based kinetic open storage platform.  Moreover to speed up the strong growth momentum we have just released our planning for [indiscernible] storage in gradual that [suppose] up to 93.5 inch hard drive for a total of 720 kilobyte [indiscernible] gigabyte per second performance. This huge storage capacity is in close in easily traceable top loaded hot swappable architecture. It also feature [indiscernible] hot swappable expandable module with four [indiscernible] HD port to maximize throughput and [free] redundancy. This new for use storage solution is a perfect for [media streaming] [indiscernible] and archive storage applications. It is just the beginning of our new generation storage products from Super Micro and we are looking forward to bring this high performance optimal storage solution to our customers starting this quarter. On the competing side GPUs for Xeon Phi solutions for HPC and enterprise continue to grow consistently and grew by 67% year-over-year. We will deliver a brand new architecture with four GPU or Xeon Phi solutions in one unit this quarter. This in line bear our architecture enable our GPU be directly connected to a CPU PCI-E length without a driver or any cables achieving the best signal integrity and minimum dependency. Now optimized there is also advantageous in performance and power efficiency with its [non pre-heated] GPU Xeon Phi that minimizes cooling power consumption. This design defines Super Micro's new cooling computing commitment while reaching high level of performance to meet the phase and tomorrow\u2019s supercomputing demands. To summarize we continue to outpace the industry growth by growing 26.1% year-over-year this quarter. We will stay on close and evolve Super Micro into a server storage total solution provider with our strong growth trend driven by technology innovation in our hardware we are expanding our average to new markets with our software products and service offering. With that said we are well positioned to finish the fiscal year 2015 on that very strong note.  For more specifics on that third quarter let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call.  Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was 471.2 million, up 26.1% from the same quarter a year ago and down 6.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solutions.  On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 34.4% followed by Europe at 8.7%. Although Asia was down 4.6%, we see great opportunities for growth in the June quarter. Other regions grew 24 million or 226.7% which includes Australia and Canada. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to seasonal weak quarter compounded by the effects of the West Coast [indiscernible]. There are a number of projects which were delivered late in the quarter and not recognized as revenue.  Slide eight. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 64.1% of total revenues, which was up from 50.1% the same quarter a year ago and from 60.1% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3,900 per unit, which is up from $2,600 last year and the same as last quarter. We shipped approximately 77,000 servers in the quarter and 1,007,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet datacenter revenue was 20.7% which is an increase from 20.3% in the prior quarter and an increase from 15.9% in the prior year, 58.1% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46.1% from our distribution and resellers. Slide 9, non-GAAP gross profit was $77 million, up 34% from 57.5 million in the same quarter last year and down 9% from 84.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.3%, up from 15.4% a year ago and down from 16.8% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.7% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.4% a year ago and 13.7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margins resulted from the ramp of new technology as well as from more complete server sales and increased scale of our business. Sequentially gross margins were down due to seasonal weakness in the quarter and lower utilization for the Taiwan facility. Slide 10 and 11, operating expenses were 42 million, up from 33.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from 38.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, same as year-over-year and up from 7.7% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute basis year-over-year primarily in R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support development of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to about 1.5 million of payroll taxes as they are reassessed at the beginning of the year. In addition, we had a foreign exchange loss of 732,000 compared to a foreign exchange gain of 844,000 primarily from our Taiwan dollar based loans. Historically, foreign exchange was 637,000 gain year to date in fiscal year 2015 compared to 103,000 gain for the same period in fiscal 2014. The company's headcount increased by 153 sequentially to 2,144 total employees to support the expansion of the business such as enterprise software and services. Operating profit was 35 million, up by 44.2% from 24.3 million a year ago and down by 24% from 46.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.4%, up from 6.5% a year ago and down from 9.1% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities we have while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to continue to deliver our operating margins and profits. Net income was 24.9 million or 5.3% of revenues, up 40.3% from 17.8 million a year ago and down 25.6% from 33.5 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis EPS was $0.47 per share, up from $0.37 per share a year ago and down from $0.65 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 52,680,000. The tax rate in the third quarter with on a non-GAAP basis was 28.3% compared to 26.4% a year ago and 27% sequentially. The rate was higher sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2014. We expect the tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32% for the June quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were 112 million, up 26.1 million from 85.9 million in the prior quarter and up 7.6 million from 104.4 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a positive 4.1 million, primarily due to our net income of 23.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable all set in part by an increase in inventory described below as well as building investments of 8.5 million to support the continued growth of our business. Slide 13, accounts receivable decreased by 37.2 million to 221.6 million due to less revenues sequentially. DSOs was 46 days, an increase of 5 days from 41 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by 21.2 million to 430.4 million to support the growth of the business in a seasonally strong quarter as well as the effects of the [port strike]. Days in inventories were 96, an increase of 13 days from 83 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was 261.6 million, which was 62 days, an increase of six days from the 56 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 80 days, which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook, during the third quarter, we continued our strong growth in a seasonally challenging quarter and more so by the [west coast port] strike. As we enter the fourth quarter, we look to take advantage of our broad breadth of solutions, which have expanded beyond hardware to include software as a service to drive our strong growth and profitability in the seasonally strong quarter for the industry. We will build upon our experiences during the past quarter to improve, to continue our delivery of product and services to our customers and partners. Therefore the Company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2015, in a range of 510 million to 560 million. Assuming this revenue range that the Company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.53 to $0.62 for the quarter. At the mid-point this will represent a growth of 25% and 45% in revenue and EPS respectively from the prior year. This would make fiscal year 2015 revenue of about 2 billion and about $2.16 EPS which will represent growth from the prior year approximately 33% and 61% respectively.  This currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. With more than 26% revenue and growth year-over-year Super Micro is again one of the fastest growing company in the IT industry if not the fastest. Despite the seasonally [softness] our long-term growth trend remains intact with our robust products and service as we\u2019re looking forward to a strong finish this fiscal year. We are well positioned with [prepared foundation] rapidly expanding customer base and that the most leading edge product [indiscernible]  Operator at this time we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz : Thanks guys for taking a couple of questions here. First Howard it looks like the port of Oakland will shut down for four days that\u2019s generally what I\u2019m seeing here and if I just think about your daily revenue either internationally or domestically on a daily basis excluding weekends obviously it\u2019s like $4 million to $7 million a day. So I mean could this have been $10 million to $15 million of revenue that got delayed out of the quarter or just kind of vaporized to a certain degree. Howard Hideshima : Yes, Alex actually [port strike] was much longer than that but to get back to what direct effects we saw, we saw our pushed out revenues approximately about 5.5 million and that doesn\u2019t count some of the other projects that we had also that were delayed because we didn\u2019t have 'chassis' if you want to call t to fully complete our things. But the direct effect of this revenue that we did not recognize that we shift was about 5.5 million. Alex Kurtz : And how does that impact the June quarter if at all, I mean the next question will be well why won't you get that back in the June quarter so how would you --? Howard Hideshima : [Multiple Speakers] come back in the June quarter Alex Kurtz : So when you think about the June quarter guidance is there some kind of conservativism that you\u2019re putting in around the [grandly] uptake or just general macro concerns, I think some of us were just expecting a little bit healthier guide on the June quarter. So just trying to understand if that has any kind of -- is anything else beyond this harbor strike that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s impacting the macro outlook for the June quarter. Howard Hideshima : Seasonally I think we\u2019re just coming out of this seasonally weak quarter. We do see a lot of projects out, there a lot of opportunities for us to further capitalize upon and at the mid-point of the guidance [indiscernible] we got about we see it about 26% --25%. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And just last question for me, then I\u2019ll pass it on. If you were to think about, you obviously got -- you shift a lot of systems this quarter and it would seem that that if you\u2019re normalizing this quarter\u2019s revenue for say December because of volume would you have eclipsed 17% gross margin if you were looking at this quarter\u2019s mix [indiscernible] system the components if you did that mix back into December quarter. Howard Hideshima : I think you\u2019re going to see likely seasonally we guided the weak quarter and it usually has an impact into our margin per se as we get into a strong quarter you typically do see a pick-up in margins there. We have a lot of grid factors that are going on as we get the capacity utilization of Taiwan up, seasonally strong quarter, continuing growth of our business in the server side of it; those are all [play] factors that will help us grow our margins in our operating [point]. Alex Kurtz : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich Kugele : Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Can you get into a little bit of color around the inventory, it increased again in the quarter, you talked about some of the port strike being related to that as well as growth in the business but that was two quarters in a row of increasing inventory, is there anything unusual going on with the composition of that inventory and then I have a follow up. Charles Liang : Yes, for the March quarter [indiscernible] port strike so we have some half time of getting a chassis especially, but now all the programs have been pretty much fixed. So our inventory now grow into a very healthy position. So it will be very [half of our] June quarter. Rich Kugele : You would expect the inventory to exit at a lower level from June? Charles Liang : Yes, that June quarter will ensure I mean inventory the kind of enough so the business grow. Rich Kugele : Okay. And then in terms of the sub system business was most of the push out in project on that side and can you just elaborate a little bit maybe about the end markets that are buying those sub systems? Charles Liang : Yes, it's postponed because no one in our chassis basically, so customers still -- indeed we ship most of them in April and somewhere being maximized May. Rich Kugele : Okay and then just lastly given the significant improvement on the storage side for multiple quarters now does it change your long-term views on what you think the operating margin can deliver or should we think of the storage business as being more comparable with the overall system side from margin [for us]? Charles Liang : Storage product might continue to be much stronger right, especially this quarter we just introduced our [indiscernible] in a really high density hot swappable kind of storage solution and this -- again that's why that's the first beginning we have a much stronger storage product line will be available month after month. Operator : We'll hear now from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : How about if we talk a little bit about the Grantley cycle, it's something we usually talk about on this call, how much of your server sales are total sales are now Grantley based? And how do see that cycle playing out over the next few quarters? Howard Hideshima : Yes, Mark this is Howard. Again we saw a good growth in that side as we expected, it quarter-to-quarter went up about 26%, for us again and that's kind of is in line with what Intel was talking about with regards to their conversion of their processor output to about half over the last six months. So it's coming out nicely for us. We have a lot of new products; a lot of products were adopted new processor that Charles talked about a bit out there, so we see great potential in the ramp coming. Mark Kelleher : So would you say that half of your sales are based on that right now in line with Intel? Howard Hideshima : Not quite half again, not quite half. Mark Kelleher : Can you just describe how you picture this cycle playing out; does this give you a surge for the next couple of quarters and then kind of plateau and pull in, how do you anticipate that effecting? Charles Liang : At this next two coming quarters, we will continue to see the beneficial from the hardware and then Grantley side and platform. That is in June quarter, September quarter. Operator : We'll move next to [Mette Hosinie with FIG]. Unidentified Analyst : Would it be possible to elaborate on the mix of the storage either as overall revenue or part of this up component? Howard Hideshima : Yes, around 20% of our revenues now, a little bit above 20% of revenues, it's a mix of basically the -- if you want to call it the hyper-scale next gen type of storage applications as well as our traditional JBOD and had no type of storage, so we've got some very exciting products as Charles mentioned earlier on the other side of the box with regards to JBOD at those size as well as increasing our partnership base out there on the next gen and hyper converge markets. Unidentified Analyst : Sure so to that extent and with some of your component vendors also talking about a strength in the near line looking in to the second half of calendar year, would there be any conflict of interest that would actually slow down or be viewed as a headwind as you try to expand the storage business line? Charles Liang : Yes, there must always a competitive right, so Super Micro has advantage since 10 years ago since the day we was founded, our advantage always better product better architecture, term to market, better quality and now better total solution including system management software and home-site service and also customer online service. Unidentified Analyst : Sure and then just one follow-up, how should we think about the ASP trend for both server and subcomponent looking into the June and September quarters? Howard Hideshima : Yes, I think as we see density increasing and our ability to provide the best dense solutions out there in the market. Historically, you've seeing our ASP continue to grow quite frankly we're at 3,900 this quarter, prior year was 2,600 and if you want to go back a couple of years it was down 1,900 back in fiscal, so you've see continued trend, this increasing quite frankly because of the density of the box and solutions that we're offering, that we're pushing more performance per box into each one of the solutions that we're delivering. And then we add software and support services on to that, that again increases value add to that box. Unidentified Analyst : Sure and can I ask one other follow-up question? Charles Liang : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : In the prepared remark you talked about the postponement of a project and I perceived that as completely independent of a port shutdown, would you be able to elaborate on what this project entails to and has this been back on track again? Charles Liang : I've been -- I will obviously say pretty much 100% back on track, so the postponement [for March] for sure will increase our June revenue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I\u2019m just curious why this project was delayed, was that due to customer changing --? Charles Liang : Because no enough components especially chassis. Q - Unidentified Analyst Okay. So it was tied into the port shut down. Charles Liang : Yes, we did ship some charging by air and that\u2019s why it of course has more for March. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move on to Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow up on that last question, just to clear the 5.5 million impact in the quarter is related to the port shut down, is there a separate impact specific to the project delay in to new size that impact. Charles Liang : Indeed the project delayed mainly because of the port strike and that\u2019s why we had no way to deliver on time. So however those have been improved in April and coming May. And the total port strike 5.5 million indeed it also closed also other deal that we cannot ship in March quarter. However, most of them will be shipped in June quarter. Q - Aaron Rakers  So just to be clear, so the -- there is a bigger impact in just the 5.5 million or 5.5 million is the total impact for the quarter. Howard Hideshima : 5.5 Aaron is basically what we did ship but we couldn\u2019t not recognize because of the [kept in] terms or what have you that were sent out in the but weren't able to recognize because of the delay caused in late deliveries there. The other part that Charles is alluding to is other projects that we have not fulfilled yet because of the product delay, components delays that is a larger number. Aaron Rakers : That\u2019s a larger number but you can\u2019t quantify that number. Howard Hideshima : We haven\u2019t quantified that, that\u2019s correct. Aaron Rakers : Okay I just wanted to be clear. Real quickly couple of other questions, you guys when you look at the model in what you\u2019ve outlined for this next quarter, it looks like you\u2019re going to be at if not above the high end of what you previously talked about 6% to 8% operating margin range. Where do you stand on providing a longer term update to that, should we think about 8% plus as being the new target model or any kind of framework of how we should think about that longer term would be helpful? Howard Hideshima : Aaron I think like I said as you look at the numbers I look at presenting some of that as far as reaching the $2 billion target if we hit the mid-point and then with our EPS growth would be at about $2.15 there. We will take a look at our model at the end of this quarter and then take a look at providing some guidance. Aaron Rakers : That\u2019s helpful. And then final other two questions, why was G&A expense up in March sequentially, is there any kind of one-time nature to that or is that a new level to consider going forward? Howard Hideshima : It\u2019s primarily in the foreign ex I\u2019d like to characterize that as I mentioned we took foreign ex loss this quarter of approximately 700,000 versus about $800,000 gain. So if you flip those two around again those two caused the majority of the change sequentially in our G&A expenses. Typically it\u2019s been fairly stable over the course of the last few quarters that do not. If I had to measure it today we measure it on today\u2019s rate that that would probably turn into about $3,000 gain. So again we\u2019ll take a look at breaking it out separately and looking at other means to potentially hedge it what have you. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then the final real quick question is, how do you think about the long-term model from a cash conversion cycle basis? I know that\u2019s been obviously impacted by some of the items that hit this quarter but longer term, how should we think about cash conversion cycle? Howard Hideshima : Well I think today in my cash conversion should hopefully come down I think was impacted a bit by the inventory this time around, also I wanted to note the property itself we spent about 8.5 million during the quarter in property and we will continue to make some investments there but we do believe it\u2019s going to be a positive. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow up from Rich Kugele. Rich Kugele : Yes, thank you. Just the Taiwan utilization rate in the quarter I don\u2019t know if I missed that and then what is the timing for your new California facility to be up and running? Charles Liang : Okay. I mean for Taiwan facility in the last quarter the reason why it was lower because we had a one big deal postponed ship into I believe this month April, as for USA facility yes, the utilities get in ready, the [indiscernible] ready to move in by July. So up there that would be beneficial to our operation. Rich Kugele : Okay. And what was the utilization number exactly? Howard Hideshima : 46%, Rich it was the utilization number. I want to also tie back on a question you had earlier potentially was the operating expenses about. We do see leverage out there I talked a bit with Aaron with regards to the effect of foreign-ex. We do see, continue to see leverage out of that. We are making investments in our software and support and those types of areas in sales people but we do continue to see and keep an eye on our operating expenses so we can get leverage there. Rich Kugele : [indiscernible] your utilization fell that much down into 46% then you also were spending on things like airfreight you would think that next quarter on a much better revenue number perhaps for your margin and your OpEx would both be significantly better yes? Howard Hideshima : Basically for sure. Operator : And there appeared to be now further questions at this time. Mr. Liang, I'll turn this back to your close remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we're looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2015 conference call. We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release, and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. We are pleased to announce that, we achieved a record quarter of growth as our revenue reached $573.6 million, it's 21.7% higher quarter-over-quarter; and 34% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $30 million or 20.3% higher quarter-over-quarter, and 54.6% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.57 per diluted share compared to $0.47 last quarter or $0.40 last year. Slide five, please. In my comments today, I would like to discuss our results last quarter, as well as our achievements during the past fiscal year, and then, I will share our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Last quarter, we achieved a record-high revenue, which was 34% higher than last year. This strong first quarter performance push our full year revenue to $1.99 billion, almost $2 billion, representing 35.7% growth over last year. Once again, our quarterly and yearly growth rates are multiple times the industry's rate, indicating that we continue to take much share, as we have planned. Even though, some industry watchers believe that server industry is mature with minimal differentiation between manufacturers, we know based on direct customer experience that is not the case with Super Micro. Our strong performance is the direct result of our unique business model that enable our partners to succeed with the most innovative application optimized server and storage solutions ahead of our competition. In addition to Super Micro's broadest product range and time to market advantages, our product continue to deliver clear performance and feature advantages, such as best performance in heterogeneous computing with the 1U 4 GPU server, highest drive capacity with a 3.5-inch drive in the 1U space. You've seen the FatTwin, 90 SAS3 drives in the 4U JBODs and highest power efficiency in Data Center Optimized Servers with our TCO products. These are just a few examples of Super Micro's differentiation. Now, I would like to mention some notable growth areas from last quarter. Our direct strategic partner account for 49.8% of total revenues. Our Internet data center and cloud products represents 15.5% of total revenues, and our complete system business account for 61.7% of total revenues. Geographically, last quarter revenue in North America was 62.2%, Europe was 19%, Asia was 14.8%, and other regions were 4% of total sales. On a year-over-year basis, regional results for North America and Europe were in line with overall growth, while Asia grew minimally. We believe our continuous investment in infrastructure will directly drive growth in Asia and all geographies. Storage continue its robust momentum as a strong product driver with 79% growth year-over-year. Our Complete Rack Solution business with 64% year-over-year growth was another solid indicator of Total Solutions growth. In addition, Super Micro's FatTwin products grew 102% year-over-year, and Ultra Dense MicroBlade family demonstrates one of our strongest product launch last year. Slide six, please. Let's fully dive into our products. I would like to mention again that, our industry unique application optimized Building Block Solutions allowed Super Micro to excel in many different vertical markets. We have over 800 customers, many are Fortune 1000 companies, who'd rely on our leading technology, and differentiation solution to surpass their competitor in their market segment. Last year, Super Micro launched many new exciting products. For example, we recently launched 1U 4 GPU/Xeon Phi solution, which is the best performing accelerated server on the market. Our streamlined layout architecture that enable PCI-E direct connect for low latency and eliminate cabling the drivers, and GPU pre-heat for most efficient air flow and cooling. Also recently, we launched a 90-Bay HyperScale Storage Enclosure, featuring top-load hot-swappable drive bay for 90 3.5 inch SAS3 or SSD in 4U. This 4U enclosure supports up to 720 terabyte of capacity, providing high density, high performance storage for OpenStack, surveillance, archiving, and many more use, where scale-up and scale-out deployment is required. Earlier in fiscal year 2015, we began production of our MicroBlade, and it became one of our strongest product launches. MicroBlade come in many configurations, including 112-Nodes Atom or 56-Node UP Xeon or 28-Node DP Xeon in the 6U platforms. This innovative architecture is a unified microserver with networking, storage, and demand management optimized for cloud computing, dedicated hosting with content delivery and social networking applications. Last, but not least, one of the most important products we launched in fiscal year 2015 is our Ultra architecture. It is designed to deliver unrivalled performance, flexibility, scalability, and the serviceability, and that can be optimized for a variety of applications. Ultra come in 1U and 2U configurations. They support a CPU up to 36 cores and 160-watt TPP, 1.5 terabyte of DDR4 memory in 24 DIMMs, 24 NVMe and aPCIe. Moreover, due to its versatility, the Ultra architecture also serves as basis for many of our new systems solutions, such as 1U 4 GPU and 1U 10 NVMe system. One of the biggest strategic areas of growth for Super Micro in 2015 was our software and service business. While we began to offer software and service in 2014, this year many more customers began utilizing our Total Solution packages. For example, Supermicro Server Manager or SSM is a powerful multiple-feature single console server manager that configures multiple machine in parallel, including how to open system software or firmware upgrade to exponentially simplify system deployment and maintenance. It also supports the upcoming graphics API, therefore enhance our interface IPMI tools. In addition to our software management tools, we also start to ramp our service suite of offering in 2015. Super Micro's service is designed to help customer improve up-time, reduce cost, and increase the productivity of their investment in Super Micro products. Our service plan offers solution, consultation and tiered on-site service from four-hour response to next business day. We are especially excited that, today thousands of customer service package (13:32) around the world. Although, the combined contribution of software and service only accounts for about 1% of our revenue in fiscal year 2015, I'm confident that it can easily triple in fiscal year 2016, providing a proportionally greater impact to profitability. In addition to our margin benefit, software and service enable us to win strategic business, especially with enterprise customers. Slide seven, please. We have also been working on improving our foundation for future growth by expanding our global logistics and capacity. Yesterday, we had the grand opening of our first new building at our Green Computing Park with 180,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space in San Jose. Also, we are in the process of finishing a new building in the Netherlands, which will double our system integration capacity there. Together, the total capacity increase will be more than 35% over existing facilities, which will allow us to continue our industry-leading growth, heading into our fiscal year 2016. To summarize, we continue to outpace industry growth in multiples by growing 34% year-over-year this quarter. We added significant new product lines to our already industry-leading array of application optimized solutions, allowing us to penetrate deeper into our customer market. We expand our order-wide capacity to enable future growth in all geography. And our new software and service offerings are significantly a factor to grow our market value, with them, we are ready to deliver even higher value products, deploy more Complete Solution, and achieve more aggressive growth going forward. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release, and in the supplemental detail on the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was $573.6 million, up 34% from the same quarter a year ago, and up 21.7% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 49.8%. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 42.3%; followed by Europe at 37.1%, while Asia was about flat. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonally strong quarter. Both our distributor and subsystem and accessory business were strong at 32.6% and 29.9% growth over the prior quarter respectively. In addition, our storage business was particularly strong with 31.8% growth over the prior quarter, with the majority of this growth coming from our traditional storage business as we expanded our high-density storage solutions. Slide eight. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 61.7% of total revenues, which is up from 55.2%, the same quarter a year ago, and down from 64.1% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $400 [sic] $4,000 per unit, which is up from $3,300 last year, and from $3,900 last quarter. We shipped approximately 87,000 servers in the quarter and 1.317 million subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with about 800 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet, data center revenue was 15.5%, which was a decrease from 20.7% in the prior quarter, and from 17.8% in the prior year. 62.2% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 50.2% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $90 million, up 35.1% from $66.6 million in the same quarter last year; and up 16.8% from $77 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7%, up from 15.6% a year ago and down from 16.3% sequentially. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 11.9% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 15.7% a year ago, and 14.7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from higher sales in complete server solutions, which included products such as storage and FatTwin. In addition, we have seen a rise in our services and support business, which is about 1% of revenue. It is growing quickly, and have high margins. Sequentially, gross margins were down due to higher subsystem and accessory revenues, and traditional storage revenues in the quarter offset in part by an increase in our purchasing power, and higher utilization of the Taiwan facility at 68.1%. Slide 10 and 11. Operating expenses were $45.3 million, up from $37.2 million in the same quarter a year ago, and up from $42 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 7.9%, which is down from 8.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and up from 8.9% sequentially. Our operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support development of our Total Solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher prototype and testing fees of approximately $1.4 million, and higher marketing and promotion costs of $0.9 million to support the development and promotion of new products. The company head count increased by 141 sequentially to 2,285 total employees to support the expansion of the business, such as enterprise, software and services. Operating profit was $44.8 million, up by 52.1% from $29.4 million a year ago, and up from 27.8% from $35 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.8%, up from 6.9% a year ago, and the same 7.4% sequentially. We continue to focus on many market opportunities while we leverage the investments we have made in our infrastructure to continue to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $30 million, up 54.6% from $19.4 million a year ago, and up 20.3% from $24.9 million, sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.57 per share, up from $0.40 per share a year ago, and down from 47% \u2013 up from $0.47 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 52,609,000. The tax rate for the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32.6% compared to 33.6% a year ago, and 28.3% sequentially. The higher rate sequentially was due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December of 2014. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the September quarter. Should the R&D tax credit be reinstated in December 2015, like it was in 2014, the impact may be 7% lower rate in the December quarter. This would make the annual non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2016 similar to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which was 30.1% and 30.6% respectively. The company continues to work on our tax planning as we continue to expand overseas. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis. Slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short and long-term investments were $98.1 million, down $13.9 million from $112 million in the prior quarter, and down $1.5 million from $99.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $64.2 million, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of $101.2 and $34.6 million increase in inventory, offset in part by the increase in accounts payable of $36.8 million described below, as well as an increase in short-term debt of $48.5 million. Slide 13. Accounts receivables increased by $101 million to $322.6 million due to the higher revenue sequentially. DSOs was 43 days, a decrease of 3 days from 46 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $33.1 million to $463.5 million to support the growth of the business. Days in inventories were 83 days, a decrease of 13 days from 96 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $299.8 million, which was 52 days, a decrease of 10 days from 62 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 74 days, which is 6 days lower than the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. During the first quarter, we continue our strong growth in a seasonally strong quarter. For the fiscal year 2015 revenue was $2 billion, and EPS was $2.15, which represented growth from the prior year of approximately 35.7% and 60.4% respectively. As we enter fiscal year 2016, we look to continue to take advantage of our broad breadth of solutions, which includes software and services to take advantage of the expanding market opportunities, which have opened up to us, as well as the leveraged investments we have made in our operations, such as our SAP implementation and new facilities to drive our strong growth and profitability in a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2015, in a range of $520 million to $580 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.49 to $0.59 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this will represent a growth of 24.1% and 17.4% in revenue and EPS, respectively, from the prior year. Looking forward beyond this quarter, we have updated our target for the coming two years to be 16% to 18% on gross margin; and 7% to 9% on operating margins. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities we have to take market share, while still maintaining our discipline and controlling our operating costs. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Howard. For 22 years, we have been a customer-centric technology company, always listening to them and developing innovative products that our customers appreciate. Now, with our software and service package fully ready, we are able to create more complete Total Solutions, greater product value, and achieve higher level of customer satisfaction. We have more than doubled our revenue in the last three years, and by continuing our focus on our advanced product lines and customers, we expect to make another aggressive dip of growth in the coming years. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : Hey, thanks, guys. Can you hear me, okay? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. Yes, we can. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : Hey, Charles. So, Howard, I just want to drill in a little bit on the margin. It sounds like this was largely due to the higher component mix. Would you expect that to reverse itself next quarter, and was there anything else in there that was a heavy weight on what drove the gross margin off a little bit this quarter? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : No, Alex. I think, as I said in this \u2013 subsystems and accessory business was higher this quarter. It grew quite frankly about 30% quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So again that, as you know, we talked about it, component and subsystem business is at a lower margin than our complete server solution business. We do expect that our complete service solution business will continue to grow. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : Okay. And just two quick follow-up questions here, Howard, on the tax rate, you said 34% for Q1. What was the guidance for the year again? Was it back down to 30% for the year? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We said it would \u2013 would be around \u2013 we said that the \u2013 if the R&D tax credit was put back in, like it was in 2015, then we would see similar, yeah, a reduction in our rate by about 7% in that December quarter. And then, if it did happen, that the rate overall for fiscal 2016 would be similar to fiscal 2015 or 2014, which is about 31%. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : So we should effectively be modeling 31% for the year? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Again, it depends on the timing of the R&D tax credit. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : No, I understand. And I'll just put this to Charles, and all three of you. You guys have talked about this $3 billion annual goal by fiscal 2017. It certainly seems like you're on that pace. Any reason you wouldn't be able, any change from that view? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : At least at that pace, if not faster. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : Okay. Good to hear, Charles. Thank you, guys. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : For next question, we'll go to Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on a torrid top line growth rate pace there. That growth though, is putting some pressure on your balance sheet as your working capital struggles to keep up. Is there a possibility or an element of increasing your pricing to slow the top line down? How do you think about gross margin versus that torrid top line versus your working capital that has to support that? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think, Mark, as we talked about before, I think there's a wonderful opportunity for us to take market share right now, and we're going to continue to focus on that part of it. There's lots of opportunities for us to go out there and go get, as Charles talked about, our top line growth, and what have you. But again, we'll be looking at that, and then we're looking at the working capital needs of the company to properly support that. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: All right. And just as my follow-up, the \u2013 can you just give us an update on where you think the Grantley Haswell cycle is? I know we ask you that every quarter, but we seem to be getting further along down that cycle, and maybe some thoughts further beyond to Broadwell coming up, how does that play out? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : In terms of new product status, we feel still in the ramp-up mode. And yes, the Broadwell is coming soon. So overall, I believe the product line advantage will continue to happen. And especially, once we announce the 1U 4 GPU, and kind of 90-Bay in 4U JBOD, that will be our strong product. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of questions if I can, as well. So first of all I want to \u2013 I'd like to dive a little bit deeper in your enterprise traction. I know you talk about software and services being about 1% of total revenue. It looks like your direct business excluding the Internet, data center grew a pretty solid 52% year-over-year. I also believe you said that you had 800 cumulative customers. I think last quarter it was 700. So can you talk a little bit more about the success you're seeing in the enterprise segment, what enterprise represents as a percentage of total, inclusive of the software and services, and where you expect that to play out through the course of this year? What kind of contribution you're expecting for the full year from enterprise? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah. I mean, our software and service program although start from fiscal year 2014, but it really grow much quicker in 2015. We grew almost triple last year, and looking forward, looks like the growth rate will be continuing very fast, because it's finally a very mature, very strong product. And that's why we are able to approach more and more enterprise customer, and after two year's usage, they have been really happy with whatever total solution we provide. So we feel pretty positive in that area. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Any estimate of how \u2013 what kind of percentage that could look like as you exit fiscal 2016? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Hopefully another triple this year, so hopefully 3% for example for software and service. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And can you talk a little bit \u2013 the second follow-up question is on the gross margin trajectory. What drives the differential between 16% versus the high-end of the band of 18%? And what you're assuming as far as the ramp of your utilization rate in the Taiwan facility? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Aaron, this is similar to what we talked about in the past. I think the levers for us, for our gross margin are still there, continue to ramp the Taiwan utilization for us, continue to build the scale of our business. And so that includes our purchasing power, improve the mix of our total server solutions. Then as Charles mentioned, the services and support portion of our revenue, as that grows, that provides us with margin uplift there, too. So those three levers are available to us, and still we're trying to execute through those levers. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And do you still think you hit the 80% utilization rate in the Taiwan facility over the next quarter or two? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : We do believe so. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Thank you. Just want to revisit the balance sheet there, because that seems to be the crux of many bear arguments I've heard. And especially in this quarter, the accounts receivable did increase $100 million Q-over-Q, versus last year, it increased only $20 million Q-o-Q. Albeit Q-o-Q revenue growth was $100 million for this June quarter versus $50 million a year ago. But it still does not seem to compute, and I think there's some concern that you may have pulled forward some demand, or is looking to move inventory that may have been getting old. So can you just address that bear argument point blank? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : This is Howard, again. I don't believe that there is any pull-forward or revenue per se. It was a seasonally strong quarter. We have lot of new opportunities out there to take advantage of, and we're leveraging on those opportunities per se. How do I put it? The enterprise space is opening up to us. A lot of the market opportunities we talk about are opening up to us, and some of those customers do demand longer terms, I've talked about before with regards to that. So again our DSOs are affected by that. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I may ask a follow-up question with respect to enterprise model. For the service line, what's the pricing model of that? Do you target a percent of sales on that service there? And can you also comment on what you expect the operating margin profile for products being sold into these corporate data centers relative to your overall margin profile? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah, for software and service issue, probably the margin is much higher. However, overall our revenue only about 1% for fiscal year 2015, and for 2016, I hope we are up to 3% or even more. So that one will be long-term growing, very positive factor. But yes, the percentage still small, although faster growing. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : Go next to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the mix, it seems like your server business was pretty good, but the top line upside was mostly driven by system and accessory. And if I were to compare your performance to the rest of the competitors this earnings season, it seems like you're gaining share. And I want you to help me understand what has enabled you to gain market share if it's indeed a share gaining story? And how should we think about the mix going forward? How should we think about the data center mix in the first half of fiscal year 2016? And I have a follow-up. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah, I mean \u2013 very good question. Basically, we have much better product, especially for (36:56) application, we have specifically optimized product for them. So customer appreciate that. And also our enterprise customer, they need on-site service. They need software for system management. Before we were pretty weak in that area, but now become much stronger, and we'll be \u2013 continue to be stronger. So we are gaining enterprise segment kind of consistently now, and better product, especially application optimized. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And then, how should we think about the mix into the first half of the fiscal year 2016, especially with the data center? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Data center indeed, it really depends on our production capacity, kind of before our limitation, pretty much production capacity. So now, with our building (37:53) grand opening, yesterday, and another new building in Netherlands, we'll be ready to move in next month. So we have much more space, much more capacity for new data center business now. So if we like, we can grow that area much more aggressively than before. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then moving onto the storage. What the mix of next-gen storage this quarter, this past quarter, and how should we think about looking forward? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : For next-generation storage, our volume had been growing very consistently. I guess, year-over-year we grew about 80%... Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : 79%. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : 79%. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : In total. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : In total. So in terms of next generation storage also, about that percentage, because we grew both for traditional storage and next-generation. I guess that percent is pretty close. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : So the next-gen storage was up almost... Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, guys. Maybe just to elaborate on your question. Actually for the Q4 versus Q4 of 2014 and 2015, actually next-gen grew about 94% year-over-year same quarter. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And is it still accounting for half of your overall storage? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Roughly a little less than half for the fourth quarter. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone, and again, congrats on what was a great quarter. I want to come back to Mehdi's question with regards to the strength in the accessories business. The systems business was great, in line or a little bit better than what we expected, but I was really surprised by the subsystems and accessories, can you maybe elaborate there in terms of what drove that growth, and where the demand came from? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think it goes in sync with what we talked about, the distributors are primarily the guys who buy the subsystem accessories business. You'll see a lockstep, kind of move with our distributor business, and our subsystems and accessories business. So distributor business was or channel business was very strong for us this quarter. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : And given the geographic mix, I'd presume that there was distributors here in the U.S. as opposed to say Europe or Asia? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Great. Great. And then as we look at the systems business, the one area that I haven't heard you really talk about \u2013 we've talked about servers and we've talked about storage. What about networking? How's the networking moving? I know it's relatively new there, but is that something that's continuing to grow for us? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah. Our networking solution is part of our Total Solution, and that has been growing consistently, although not as fast as our storage. But long-term, yes, that will be one of our focus as well. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Great. Great. Again, guys, great quarter. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions. The \u2013 in terms of the issues that impacted you negatively last quarter from the port crisis, getting the chassis and Taiwan program that had been delayed, we assume \u2013 should we assume from the revenue that all those issues were resolved, and you were able to ship all your backlog? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And when you look at storage, how much was it as an overall percent of revenue? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : About 21%. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: I know you don't want to talk about fiscal 2016 right now, but just directionally, do you think that, it can continue to increase as a percent? Or would you anticipate that the systems side just broadly catches up, and maybe it will stay where it is? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. We continue introducing even better storage system. For example, 4U 90-Bay and lots of other (42:10) storage Total Solution. So I believe storage product line in terms of percentage will continue to grow. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Then just lastly just to understand the timing of the capacity coming online, and the potential impact to gross margin. Should we assume that the first half of fiscal 2016 sees a dip as that capacity comes online? Or can you bring it on linearly as the revenue needs it? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : We will control the margin kind of like we have a strong demand from our big data center, but only when we have extra capacity or in-house capacity, otherwise we are little bit selective for customer. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release, and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. First quarter revenue was $530.2 million. It is 7.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 19.6% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $23.4 million, or 21.9% lower quarter-over-quarter and 1% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $0.57 last quarter, or $0.46 last year. As previously disclosed, first quarter revenue was lower than expected, due to seasonal effect, combined with weaker European and Asia business activity and some customer push-out. We usually expect a seasonal effect in the summer quarter, due to the summer holiday. Nonetheless, first quarter revenue was 19.6% higher year-over-year. That represent a strong start to this fiscal year. Geographically, North America revenue was up over 40% year-over-year. Europe was down by 2.1% year-over-year. In Asia, revenue was lower year-over-year by 15%, led by the decline in China of 40.3%. The rest of Asia was up 6.5% year-over-year, and up sequentially by 15.6%. Once again, with 19.6% growth in a seasonally weak quarter, we are off to a strong start for meeting our fiscal 2016 gross target, at over 20% growth rate. This is supplemented by the fact that we had achieved new high with our direct customer billings, which accounted for 55% of our total revenue to date. Server and Storage Systems account for 69.2% of total revenue, which is also high \u2013 a new high. This encouraging fact has shown that our customers are gravitating towards our higher-value completed system and total solution offerings, which does say (6:07) our growth strategy for 2016 remain continue product evolution to grow key business vertical, such as Cloud, Internet Datacenter, Storage, Embedded, IoT, HPC, and for sure, Enterprise. Cloud and Internet Datacenter were particularly strong, and account for 24.8% of total revenue, led by our (6:36), TCO, and Twin product lines. That should not be surprising, because each of these three product lines were uniquely optimized for Cloud hyperconverged applications. The (6:50) architecture provides system flexibility, expansion, and a two (6:55) I/O bandwidth and density, while the TCO provides cost-effective solutions to our customers. The Twin architectures delivered the best performance per watt, with greater computing and storage density and serviceability. The brand-new 1U TwinPro architecture with the Power Stick technology had taken a step further on optimizing the Twin architecture and addressing full system redundancy in a compact 1U form factor, optimized for today's big data and mission-critical applications, features that our competitor cannot offer; also optimized for the cloud market (7:40) and a favorite of hosting. Our MicroBlade offers advanced power-saving natural architecture, leads (7:51) the industry by dramatically increasing computing density to maximize performance per watt, per dollars, and per square foot, all while offering the best-in-class TCO. The upcoming 3U MicroBlade is an evolution of the original MicroBlade, reducing in form factor for unparalleled flexibility, easier deployment, and serviceability. The new MicroBlade is also a great choice for all flash storage applications. Storage Solution continued to evolve into a major element of our revenue mix and growth strategy. It was approximately 22% of total revenue, and grew 60.3% year-over-year. Our Storage Solutions are in strong demand due to the market quickly adopting software-defined storage trend. Our robust product lines are designed with excellent choice of performance, form factor, density, and of course, leading power efficiency. Representing our innovation, we offer leading NVMe fresh storage array solutions, providing customer a scalable high-IOPS storage infrastructure that delivers performance, reliability, cost effectiveness, as well as ease of management in an all-flash and hybrid storage solution. We also introduced a 4U 90-bay hyperscale storage gear box and 4U 60-bay high-density storage server featuring single and redundant controller options. With the industry's strongest product lines and leading architectures, we continue to extend our competitive advantages and further penetrate the new Storage market by delivering higher performance data workload of any scale. On the Embedded and IoT Solution front, we have optimized our compact form factor product portfolio to offer increased computing and graphical performance with greater energy efficiency. This product experienced great success in commercial, industrial, medical, and military applications. In combination with our new IoT Gateway, Super Micro offer total end-to-end infrastructure solutions for the most mission-critical data-dependent operations and applications. Our High Performance Computing continues to be a key growth area this fiscal year. Although HPC products were typically seasonal, our new products will serve as a growth driver for our potential customers. Our 1U 4 GPU/Xeon Phi systems, with its streamlined layout architecture, enable PCIe direct contact for (11:11) as well as eliminating cable repeater and GPU heat (11:16) for maximum air flow and cooling. With these great products, we should achieve an even stronger penetration in the HPC market. The Enterprise market is another fast-growing area for Super Micro. We invest to this market by developing total solution, including (11:38) and service, which we have discussed in previous quarter. The solution, mission-critical, and the uptime deployment had contributed to the 150% annual growth rate of our onsite service and management software business. We had expanded our Super Micro System Management, SSM, offering to reduce the cost and time for system deployment, update, and service. With the reliability of our industry standard Redfish Management API, we will provide our customer with greater interoperability, choice, and flexibility. Although our Enterprise market overall may maintain flat, we expect continued strong share growth in the Enterprise market with our superior product line and solution portfolio. In summary, Super Micro is growing in many different market verticals. We have products that offer choice, innovation, performance, savings, and are optimized for our customer applications. We expect to have a strong fiscal 2016 growing significantly faster than the rest of our industry, targeting over 20% growth annually. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses, and similar item on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the first quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was $530.2 million, up 19.6% from the same quarter a year ago and down 7.6% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions which result 43.5% led by our growth in Cloud/Internet datacenter of 116.7%, and Storage of 60.3% year-over-year. On a geographic basis we had strong growth in the U.S., up 42.8%, offset in part by weakness in parts of Asia and Europe. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to seasonal weakness coupled with some geographical weakness in Asia and Europe. While our OEM and direct customer business was up 2.2% our distributor revenue was down 17.2%. Complete servers were up 3.7%, while subsystems and accessory business was down 25.7%. Our Cloud/Internet datacenter business grew 47.3% which benefited both our OEM direct customers and complete server numbers. Slide eight. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 69.2% of total revenues, which was up from 57.7%, in the same quarter a year ago, and up from 61.7% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4200 per unit, which is up from $3600 per unit a year ago, and from $4,000 last quarter. We shipped approximately 87,000 servers in the quarter and 916,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud/Internet Datacenter revenue was 24.8%, which was an increase of 15.5% from the prior quarter, and from 13.7% in the prior year. 65.4% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 45% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $83.1 million, up 19.7% from $69.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 7.7% from $90 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7% for this quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 13.2% of the total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.5% a year ago and 11.9% sequentially. Gross margin was the same as the prior year. Higher sales and fleet/server solutions, the continued growth of X10 Haswell-based solutions, and stronger vendor relationships were positive to margins. This was also in part by higher Cloud/Internet Datacenter sales, which typically have lower margins. Gross margin sequentially was the same. Higher sales of Complete Server Solutions as well as the continued growth of X10 Haswell product were positive to margins. A seasonally weak quarter, declining component pricing, and lower utilization with the Taiwan facility at 51.3% had a negative effect on margin. Operating expenses were $47.1 million, up from $34.8 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $45.3 sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, which is up from 7.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 7.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our Total Solution and the lack of $1.9 million R&D VAT tax credit from Taiwan, which occurred last year. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses of $4.1 million due to annual salary adjustments and $1.4 million of higher legal and accounting expenses primarily related to the investigation of marketing expenses; offset in part by higher foreign exchange gain of $1.8 million. The company head count increased by 116 sequentially to 2401 total employees to continue to support the development of our technologies and growth of our business. Operating profit was $35.9 million, up by 3.8% from $34.6 million a year ago, and down by 19.7% from $44.8 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.8%, down from 7.8% a year ago and 7.8% sequentially. Net income was $23.4 million, up 1% from $23.2 million a year ago and down 21.9% from $30 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP \u2013 fully diluted EPS was $0.45 per share, down from $0.46 per share a year ago, and down from $0.57 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 52,042,000. The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 34.4% compared to 32.7% a year ago, and 32.6% sequentially. The tax rate was higher sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit back in December of 2014. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the December quarter. Should the R&D tax credit be reinstated in December 2015, like it was in 2014, the impact may be 7% lower in the December quarter. Company is working on our tax structure to leverage our overseas expansion, which may reduce our tax rate in the coming year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments were $113.6 million, up $15.5 million from $98.1 million in the prior quarter, and down $6.6 million from $20.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. In the first quarter, free cash flow was $12.6 million primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable of $25.4 million, net income of $20.5 million, and an increase in income tax payable of $6.8 million; offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $37.7 million an increase in property, plant, and equipment of $7.7 million, mainly related to the (20:09) manufacturing facility and warehouse building which was completed in August 2015. Slide 13. Accounts receivable decreased by $25.4 million sequentially, to $297.1 million, due to lower revenues in the seasonally weak quarter. DSO was 54 days, an increase of 11 days from 43 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $2.1 million sequentially to $461.4 million. Days in inventory were 95, an increase of 12 days from 83 days in the prior quarter, as we had seasonal weakness in the current quarter, coupled with preparation of inventory for growth in the next quarter. Accounts payable was $263.2 million, which was 58 days, an increase of 6 days from 52 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 91, which is 17 days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. In the first quarter, we grew about 20% in a seasonally weak quarter in which we went live with SAP in the U.S., continue to expand our product lines, and opened a new facility. As we enter the second quarter, we continue our work to roll out SAP in Asia and Europe to go live during the early part of the next calendar year. And we look to leverage the investments we have already made to drive our strong growth and profitability in a seasonally strong quarter for the industry. We have tempered our guidance for some of the weakness we saw at the end of last quarter; therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2015 in the range of $580 million to $630 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.54 to $0.64 per share for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 20.3% of revenues and decline of 9.8% in EPS from the prior year. Looking forward beyond the quarter, we are targeting fiscal year 2016 revenues at a growth rate of over 20%. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities which we have to take market share. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Howard. With the 19.6% revenue growth year-over-year, we are off to a strong start for fiscal 2016. We remain as the fastest-growing major company in the IT industry, growing over 20% annually, versus the flat or low single-digit in the rest of our industry. Our long-term growth strategy remains intact. With our robust products and service, we are well positioned in the key growth geo and markets, and we will move ahead with our strategy for greater success this year. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. . And we'll go first to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks for taking my question. Howard, back to your expectation for revenue growth of more than 20% fiscal year 2016, how should we think about progression of gross and operating margin? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Well Mehdi, I think, like I said, a lot of the factors we talked about with regard to moving our gross margins higher, and our operating margins higher, is leveraging the growth in our revenues. So again, you see progression as we leverage on those revenues going forward. We have put out targets previously, and we're still \u2013 we have not changed those targets for our gross margins at being at 16% to 18%, and our operating margins at 7% to 9% within the next two years. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. And regarding China that was down this past quarter, it seems like the growth for some of the key segments in China could actually come in higher than other regions over the next several quarters. How do you plan on expanding your capacity going forward? You are expanding capacity in California, but is there any possibility or scenario where you would slow that down in favor of increasing capacity in Taiwan that would support the growth of some of the customers in China? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Indeed, our growth in Japan and Korea is getting very strong. And also, we plan to support Europe from Asia directly, for key account (25:59). So the Taiwan facility the capacity should be continued if the (26:04) continue to improve. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Charles, would capacity \u2013 available capacity in Taiwan be good enough for China given the assumption that to participate in the growth in China you may have to have local presence especially when it comes to manufacturing? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, that's basically true. So, we support China from Taiwan. That's much better than before. We support China from U.S.A., I mean two years ago. So now we support from Taiwan, and this is much better than that. And at the same time, our growth in Japan and Korea had been kind of in very good shape. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, thank you. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Mehdi, just to add that we have additional lines there in Taiwan that we can always bring up facilities currently capable of holding additional lines there. We only have three lines up. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it, thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Let's stay on the China topic. That was down pretty significantly year-over-year. What's the issue there? Is that a macro issue or is there some local competition there that's blocking the growth? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : I guess it's a combination, but it's also a seasonal impact. So we are improving our investment in China, especially sales and our service team, and similar to Korea and Japan. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Are you seeing increased competition there from Lenovo? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : We see overall a local company was becoming the more aggressive recently. But still with a stronger product line, we have good confidence, continue to gain market share in China. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And are we still expecting some improvement in gross margin from better utilization in Taiwan manufacturing? Is that still possible? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we will list our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm sorry to do this, but I want to stick on the China topic a little bit. When you look at the numbers, I think you actually had reported that the rest of Asia Pac was up 15% sequentially or 15.6% sequentially. A real quick math to me would still suggest that China was actually down also north of 40% on a sequential basis. So I'm just curious as you kind of roll forward your outlook given how significant China looks like it was historically to Asia Pac. What are you assuming for China out over the next quarter, couple of quarters? Was there some one-time deals that pushed out there, or \u2013 I'm just trying to gauge what's baked in to your expectation on the next couple of quarters? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Aaron, I think we still have good partnerships in China. We still see that area to be a good growth area for us per se. So again, some of this is baked into it. As Charles also alluded to with regard to the rest of Asia, it has some very good potential out there in Japan and in Korea and other places, so there are great areas for us to continue to grow out there in the Asia area. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you talk a little bit as a follow-up to that, or maybe a little bit adjacent to that, but can you talk a little bit about the push-outs you saw at the end of the quarter, how material were they relative to your initial \u2013 let's say the midpoint of your initial guidance? Can you rank seasonality versus the push-outs in the quarter and what the contributions were from that relative to the reported results? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Let me add a little bit. Basically we see some push-out in October, this month. Indeed, we already see some increase on October. So (30:24) some push-out from September. And also, it's a transition, that kind of (30:33) our transition a little bit. Not much, but in that last three months we already fixed most of our challenge. So now, I mean, in terms of (30:42) response to customer demand is get back to a normal, and I believe looking forward, we will continue to improve, because people are now much familiar with the new system now. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll cede the floor. Thank you. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And we move to our next question from Alex Kurtz with Sterne CRT. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Hey, guys can you hear me okay? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Just to follow-up on Aaron's last question and Charles, your response, did you just say that you guys closed some business that pushed out from September and you closed in October? Did I hear that right? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. Basically, we saw some push out from September, and we see some increase on October. Yes, that's right. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : But specifically, Charles, the deals, the bigger deals that you guys saw push out from September, those deals have closed in October? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think \u2013 Alex, like I said, seasonality was probably the main thing that we had driving the quarter per se, okay? Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : So again push-outs weren't the main \u2013 the majority. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : We know how to chase that. So just a question on the range here, Howard, I think last quarter you had \u2013 on the range, the guidance, you had a $60 million range last quarter, and it looks like this quarter it's a $50 million range. You just came at the lower end of guidance. There's obviously some seasonality you saw in September. So I guess my questions would be why not maintain a $60 million range here for December given that, who knows, maybe there's some seasonality that bleeds over into December? Or is it you just have a high level of confidence in the pipeline going into December than you did in September? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think we tempered our guidance given some of the seasonality and things that happened last quarter per se. And then obviously, we feel, like I said, a little more better with the strong seasonality that happens this quarter. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. So you don't feel like you need to \u2013 because you came at the low end of the range for September, you don't feel like you need to increase your discount rate? Or maybe you already have in this December guide? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : That's why the range is smaller. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the gross margin obviously you did very well with the Server, which are higher-margin, but the sequential decline in revenue probably hit margin on the other side. So as we think about December margin levels, I mean, how should we think about the mix between servers and subsystems? I imagine December's probably a good server quarter, fully configured systems. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I guess the margin concern, this quarter should be slightly stronger than last quarter, part of the reason because last quarter we faced some components price drop especially DRAM. That happened in last quarter, and this quarter we feel it should be at least slightly better. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And Howard just on the tax rate here, I think a lot of us were not modeling 34% for the rest of the year and into the out-year. I mean that's probably some disconnect between the street's number and what you guys have guided to for Q2 here. So the question is should we just assume 34% for the rest of the year until we are told otherwise, or \u2013 how should we think about that? Because that's obviously going to impact leverage on the bottom line. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Of course. Alex, as I alluded to, like I said, part of the difference between, say, our prior years of about 30%-odd is because of the R&D tax credit, right? Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Yeah. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : And quite frankly, I've told folks basically that we don't know to handicap when the R&D tax credit \u2013 that R&D tax credit might be back, like I said. But if it happens this quarter, it could be up to about 7% change in our tax rate if it gets passed like it last year. But again we haven't built that in, and quite frankly I can't \u2013 I haven't built that into \u2013 going forward. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And just last question here, just so there's no surprises when March rolls around and you guys give the guidance for that, every year you've had some sequential decline in the March quarter just due to seasonality. Well, at least last year, you did; the year before, you did; because of some strong cloud business. But how should we \u2013 would you expect, based on what you know now, some seasonality in the March quarter? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think it is seasonal, Alex. It's still seasonal. We've still seen that over the years. Obviously, we had some projects and good products coming out there that will help us. In the past, it helped us go beyond what the seasonality had done. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah. Also, another factor is (35:31) I mean as you people may know, India have by a \u2013 well, we're coming early next year. And we (35:40) strong Storage product line about last month. So all of those will help us grow our profitability and revenue for December quarter and the next coming years. Kind of like our (35:59), our 1U 4-GPU, and 2U NVMe. So that \u2013 we're (36:09). Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : All right. Thank you guys. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Thanks. Have a few questions. First, what percent of revenue does China represent in fiscal year 2015? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : We haven't broken it out specifically. It's still the majority of the revenues. We have not broken it out separately, though. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Majority of APAC, you mean, right? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Yeah, okay. All right. Okay, so subsystem year-over-year growth, it looks like that was down \u2013 I'm sorry, subsystem year-over-year unit growth was down 27% year-over-year. Is this all attributable to the issues you saw in China, or is there more to it than that? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah, kind of a portion affected by China, but also more customer like to buy our completed solution. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Oh, I see. Okay. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : (37:15) Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Right. Okay. And then finally, your DSOs did go up substantially Q-o-Q and year-over-year. Is that purely an effect of customer mix \u2013 you did have a very significant uptick in the Internet Datacenter? Or was there also the effect of the weakness at the end of the quarter that also drove that? And then, given that context, you alluded to greater confidence for the December quarter, but that doesn't mesh well with that rising DSO. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : We saw a strong move in Storage solution. And when people buy our Storage Solution, a big portion of them move our completed solution. And Storage system usually have a higher ASP than services. That's another factor. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. I'll cede the floor. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Good afternoon, guys. I want to stick on Storage if we can. Obviously good year-on-year growth. I'm wondering if we could get an assessment in terms of how much of the total sales does Storage make up now? And can you maybe give us some clarity in terms of next-gen Storage, as opposed to JBOD type of storage? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, 22% is about the total percentage of revenues. Believe it was about 15% on the \u2013 let me get back to you on that, Brian. Just a second. Let me hold that for a second. We do see the growth in the areas, both in our traditional and in our next-gen Storage, going very well. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yeah. But we started to see a new generation (39:12) Storage growing very strongly with our customer base. And that's why we have a big (39:17) product line. Again, this is (39:19-39:24) including converged hybrid solution \u2013 hyperconverged and some other solutions, anyway (39:32) Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Right. And just as a follow-up to that, obviously there's been a lot of disruption going on within the Storage market, whether it's consolidation with some of the leaders or competitors of yours combining. As you look forward beyond this near term and we look at the pricing mechanisms and the capacity that your various vendors have, how should we think about your Storage market and what it means to your gross margins? I recognize that, from a system standpoint, they're relatively high ASPs, but one would imagine that if you're throwing a whole bunch of rotational storage, it doesn't have the best margin profile. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : We have been a very aggressive, and have a strong product for new generation software-defined storage. And we have a strong product line. Again, we just start to launch last month for a 90-bay 4U and 4U 60-bay and 2U 48-bay. So all of those will grow the value. So at the least, the net profit will grow. And as to the gross margin, I believe we'll be slightly improving as well. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. I'll cede. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Kugele from Needham Company. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me all right? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes, Rich. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah we can. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. So, a few questions, just to round out what's been asked before. Can you just clarify \u2013 so you \u2013 Howard, you were saying that you were going to be doing an SAP deployment this quarter in both Asia and in Europe. Is that correct? Are you doing them both at the same time? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We just completed our U.S. SAP rollout in July, in the first week of July. And so we're now following that up with our Asia and European. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And what have you done to make sure that you don't have any of the hiccups you had in the U.S.? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think... Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : (41:53) Our people already done here (41:55). So now we are able to train our people in Asia and Europe much more efficiently. So I believe the deployment in Asia and Europe should be much more smooth. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, what is your target given some of the changes in your mix, the greater percentage of the (42:17) server systems, the greater percentage of Storage? What is the right way to view the balance sheet metrics nowadays? Because we do get a quite a bit of questions around this. What is your target cash cycle days and what do you think is necessary from an inventory perspective to have the proper parts on hand? Any update there? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think, Rich, we have told you folks that I think the mid-80s before cash conversion cycle days is still what we're holding to and targeting for ourselves is what we talked about. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, (42:55) Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : In the inventory area \u2013 I'm sorry. And in the cash conservation cycle days, you've seen us in about the mid-70s or so. And it's propping up a bit, but again, if you look at some of the seasonality, always keeps trying to smooth itself up. In the AR side of it, as we penetrate more enterprise and lock some of these global 1,000 customers, I have talked to you guys about our DSOs on AR possibly (43:19) increasing there. So again, we'll see some uptick there. And then hopefully, we'll be managing our payables and our inventory a bit better to bring it down. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Then, just lastly, Storage had grown so much. Is all that from previous wins or have you added any new customers in the quarter? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Both. The old customers continued to grow, basically, and at the same time, we also gained more new customer. Again, I'll state here to make sure (43:50) Super Micro is actually the best of the storage server hardware company, so we are always welcome to work with old partner and new partner. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent. Okay. Thank you. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move to our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Storage, can you provide the mix of legacy and next-gen Storage? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Basically, the new generation Storage is growing faster for sure. As mentioned... Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : What would you put at the September quarter? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : For September, Howard, do you have a (44:33) Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. For the September quarter, Mehdi, again roughly about $44 million of $113 million was next-gen, and about $69 million was traditional Storage. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. And then my last follow-up. When I look at your revenue per head count and operating profit per head count, it seems like there has been a sequential and year-over-year decline especially as you expand your capacity in California. I'm going back to my \u2013 I'm sorry. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Two reasons. One is we are expanding our new facility aggressively. So we had to hire people to train people, especially with quality system conversion (45:21). At the same time, we are also growing stronger in System Solution. So we hire more software engineer, system engineer. And all those, from the day you hire to the day they contribute takes some quarters. So that's kind of good investment, but yes, for short-term, it shows some burden. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Sure. Actually I was going to ask you about your confidence in scaling the incremental cost added. It seems to me that China was down in the reported quarter, and most of your leverage with the key customers are also in China and in U.S. So what gives you the confidence that you're going to be able to bring the volume and be able to improve profitability? Since early this year, there has been some fluctuation, and early in the year we had the port factor, and now we had -- we've seen for the September quarter some push-out. And then looking into March, there is some seasonality. And I'm just trying to get a feel for whether fiscal year could be back-end loaded in terms of that 20%-plus growth rate for fiscal year, and if it's back-end loaded, what gives the confidence that the volume is going to come in? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : I guess a few factors. Number one, still, products. I mean that's why I mentioned since last month, we introduced some very advanced product and continue in next few months. Almost every month we have a new product available. And then Q1 (47:03) we have (47:05) available. That's the product side. And other than that, we are also growing very aggressively in the East Coast. As you may know, we just have an East Coast office open two weeks ago in New Jersey. And also, we are growing very aggressively in Midwest including Chicago area. And so is Europe. So we did also investment in territory, in product, and those for sure will be very positive to our business in the near future. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it. Thank you. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I had a follow-up as well. So a couple of quick questions. So first of all, I was just curious of what, with the variables involved in the operating expense line \u2013 I think it was a $1.4 million impact from the marketing examination this last quarter \u2013 what are you assuming on the operating expense line this quarter, and how should we model that over the next couple of quarters? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think we went through our annual salary increase. So if you start it off as the baseline there, you take off some of the unusual expense, let's say for the investigation that we added into the marketing expense. So you take that off per se there, and then pare out some of the foreign exchange gain. I think you'll get to a baseline where we start at about $47 million this quarter. I think when you start down at the baseline, look from there going up a little bit, I think that's a fair baseline. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So $47 million this quarter is kind of the right number to be thinking about? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : In the September quarter, that's where we ended up, and so up from there a bit. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just real quickly on \u2013 just curious. I know you had provided some color on the breakdown of the Storage categories. Can you help us understand how fast the grown has been in your new/emerging Storage categories relative to the traditional? And also would you mind talking a little bit or disclosing the growth rate or decline that you saw on the High Performance Computing vertical? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : For Storage, as we just shared, year-over-year we grew about 60%. So I believe form the next 12 quarters, next 12 months, our storage will continue to have a very growth. If another 50%, 60% or up, that won't surprise me. So that's with Storage. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And the HPC vertical? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : HPC, I believe, we have gradually smooth growth. Not as fast as Storage, but we are continuing to grow. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What was the HPC growth this quarter? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : HPC roughly was about \u2013 this quarter, year-over-year was actually down a bit sequentially, about 11%. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : It appears at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal second quarter. Second quarter revenue was $639 million, another record high for Super Micro. It's 23% higher quarter-over-quarter and 27% higher year-over-year. Super Micro is a long-term, very high growth company. We have grown five times since Q1 2009. We are on target for meeting our fiscal 2016 revenue and growth rate projection of greater than 20%. Our calendar quarter is above target, as well as our year-to-date fiscal first half performance. Non-GAAP net income was $38 million and was 13.4% higher, compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.73 per diluted share, compared to $0.32 last quarter, or $0.65 last year. In the seasonally strong second quarter, our growth rate was more than four times the industry's average, and we continue to strongly increase market share. Our growth was mainly driven by our Complete System Solutions, which account for 71% of our total revenue in the quarter. We also saw growth across our strategic verticals, with the cloud and Internet data center representing 30% of total revenue. Storage solutions, again, showed strong growth, up 58% from last year and now accounts for 21% of total revenue. These high-growth segments have contributed to our strong business growth. We have been securing new design-wins with superior first-to-market technology and application optimization. They are keys to our winning strategy for our Completed Systems and Solutions. A couple of strong examples of growing partnerships in this quarter include a Fortune 50 company that started to shift new private cloud and storage appliance with our high-storage density and NVMe supported twin architectures. Another Tier 1, also a new big customer, kind of big data Internet company who just scale from development to a hybrid (6:13) using the 4U (6:18), our FatTwin that delivers the (6:20) power efficiency, computing density and performance (6:26). These are truly win-win scenarios. Our product portfolio provides our customers incredible flexibility. Our first go-to-market innovation enables them to deliver the most optimized solution, and our expanding enterprise capabilities provided them the global support and serviceability they require. Slide four, please \u2013 slide five, please. The strong growth of our storage business has been driven by the rapid market adoption of software-defined storage. We should update this storage hardware portfolio in the industry. A large number of storage appliance vendors rely on Super Micro to build their (7:17) storage platforms. Revenue from our storage appliance partners was a significant contributor in our overall storage growth. On the product and technology side, we are an industry leader in hybrid and all-flash NVMe storage systems, empowering software-defined storage solutions that dramatically outperforms our legacy proprietary storage technology. We introduced our Simply Double Storage architecture with an industry-first to you hot-swappable four tier (7:51) base system. We patent the second level of tier of storage which delivers up to (8:03) capacity of comparative systems. We has seen strong demand for our new 3U MicroBlade with its high-computing density, supporting up to 8 Xeon processors per 1U. The compute is combined with an impressive storage capacity for traditional Datacenter and also a greater choice for all-flash hybrid storage applications. Betting on the strong success of our 4U 90-bay Storage TwinPro we are expanding the product line with 90-Bay and 60-Bay storage service systems and more. The revenue on the (8:53) and Datacenter optimize, TCO recommends several products grew more than 50% year-over-year. Customers like our extremely high memory and storage capacity and I/O expandability, while offering the lowest TCO via high power efficient system design. With the coming months of new Intel GM processor, code name Broadwell we are expecting continued strong growth on the (9:28) and TCO products as many datacenter will upgrade to the faster and more efficient technology. Continuing to deliver on our first to market strategy we are already providing many Broadwell based products to customers, seeking early development and testing. Our software portfolio in global service grew relatively new and starting from a small base. Continue to be our fastest growing high-margin product line. The software and service products are key to the success of our overall solution, sales strategy and critical contributor to our long-term margin growth. Over the last year, we doubled our Super Server Manager, or SSM software user base and more than doubled our software and service revenue. These numbers will now only continue to grow as we continue to promote and expand our SSM features. On our global service, we are continuing to invest in our service capability, capacity and expanding fleet application engineering to support our growth in the enterprise market. Slide six please, Geographically, North America was 63.7% revenue and was up 41.9% year-over-year. Europe was 17.9% of total revenue and up 24.6% year-over-year. In Asia, revenues were 13.8% of total revenue and up 3.5% year-over-year. We have seen that our strategy of focusing on North America and Europe is paying dividends in term of overall revenue growth and better profitability. We are continuing the effort of global expansion as we complete new construction bases of our green computing parts in Silicon Valley. And doubled our production facilities in Europe. Latin America increased our manufacturing scale to service our customer worldwide. In summary, Super Micro had, again, set a record high quarter for revenue and earnings. We are in the strongest position that has ever been. And we are growing multiple times faster than the overall industry. Now, we are extremely focused on executing our strengths in technology and leveraging our global foundation. We believe heading to 2016 will be a very strong year for Super Micro. For more specific on the December quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Charles. And good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was a record $639 million, up 27% from the same quarter a year ago, and up 23% sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 50.1% led by our growth in cloud datacenter of 86.3% and storage of 58.4% year-over-year. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in the U.S., up 41.9%, as well as growth in parts of Europe and Asia. Our Services and Software revenue have grown by over 100%. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily due to our continued execution of our business model and seasonal strength. Our direct customer business was up 45%, while our distributor revenue was up 8%. Complete Servers was up 50.1%, while subsystems and accessory business was down 7.7%. Our cloud datacenter business grew 48.3% as we grow our existing relationships and establish new relationships. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 71% of total revenues, which was up from 60.1% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 68.6% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4,400 per unit, which is up from $3,900 last year and from $4,100 last quarter. We shipped approximately 102,000 servers in the quarter and 1,093,000 subsystems and accessories. It's the first time we have gone over 100,000 servers units shipments in the quarter. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues at 15%. Cloud datacenter revenues was 29.7%, and storage was 20.7% of quarterly revenues. 63.7% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 41.9% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $106.6 million, up 25.9% from $84.7 million in the same quarter last year, and up 47.2% from $72.5 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 16.7% for the quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 13.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 13.7% a year ago, and 13.2% sequentially Gross margin of 16.7% is comparable to the prior year's gross margin of 16.8%. Our sales in Complete Server Solutions and strong vendor relationships were positive to margin. These were offset in part by higher cloud datacenter sales which typically have lower margins. Gross margin sequentially was higher primarily due to the strong vendor relationships and higher sales of Complete Server Solutions. Utilization for Taiwan was comparable at 51.2%. Operating expenses were $53.5 million, up from $38.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $47.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.4%, which is up from 7.7% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our new products such as our MicroBlade and Simply Double Storage Solution, as well as our software and support services to support the growth of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses to support the development of our products and growth of our business, and the difference in foreign exchange gain and loss of $2.4 million. The company head count increased by 120 sequentially to 2,521 total employees. Operating profit was $53.1 million, up 15.3% from $46.1 million a year ago and up by 109.9% from $25.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 8.3%, down from 9.1% a year ago and up from 4.9% sequentially. Net income was $38 million, up 13.4% from $33.5 million a year ago and up 130.4% from $16.5 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.73 per share, up from $0.65 per share a year ago, and up from $0.32 per share sequentially. The number of fully-diluted shares used in the second quarter was 52,113,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 28%, compared to 27% a year ago, and 34.2% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2015. The R&D tax credit was made permanent. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32.2% for the March quarter. The company is working on our tax structure to leverage our overseas expansion, which may reduce our tax rate in the coming year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments were $172.6 million, up $59 million from $113.6 million in the prior quarter; and up $86.7 million from $85.9 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was $59 million, primarily due to net income of $34.7 million and an increase in accounts payable of $58.4 million, offset in part by increases in inventory of $27.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $17.8 million. We are working on extending our loan facilities to support the continued growth of the company, both domestically and abroad. Slide 13. Accounts receivable increased by $17.1 million sequentially to $314.2 million, due to higher revenues in a seasonally strong quarter. DSOs, days inventory outstanding was 44 days, a decrease of 11 days from 55 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $77.2 million sequentially for up to $486.5 million, due to preparation of inventory ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday and preparation for our Broadwell Solutions. Days in inventories were 82 days, a decrease of 13 days from 95 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $321.2 million, which was 50 days, a decrease of 8 days from 58 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 76 days, which is 15 days lower than our prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. In the second quarter, we grew about 27% in a seasonally strong quarter in which we continue to extend our product lines and execute our business model. Year-to-date, we have exceeded our revenue goal objective of over 20% growth for the year. As we enter the third quarter, we continue our development for the Broadwell launch, but do not expect material contributions this quarter. In addition to seasonal softness of the March quarter for the industry, we are also cautious of the current macroeconomic environment. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2016 in a range of $530 million to $580 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.43 to $0.53 for the quarter. As a midpoint, this will represent our growth of 18% of revenue and 1% in EPS for the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent development. However, the company may update the outlook or a portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you, Howard. 2016 is shaping up to be a year of robust growth for Super Micro. We see huge opportunities as the market shifts toward software-defined, big data, and cloud-based solutions where Super Micro had great track record of leveraging our solid engineering foundation to produce innovative products and services for those market. We are on target for meeting our fiscal 2016 revenue and growth rate projection of greater than 20%, and with that, I'm confident we will continue to outperform the market and grow multiple times faster than the rest on the industry, most short-term and long-term. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Just a couple of questions if I could. Maybe first start with what type of growth did you see in China? I noticed that you said the Taiwanese facility utilization was, I think, basically flat sequential basis. So maybe the growth in China and then how do we think about the Taiwanese facility utilization going forward? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. I mean, indeed, we had a very aggressive improvement in our sales and support force in Europe. And now, with global operation, we will support Europe partially from Asia. So, the Asia facility integration will improve. And at the same time, we also started to support some strategic cuts more in Asia, including China. So our utilization rate for Taiwan facility should start to grow gradually. Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, can we talk a little bit about the OpEx? I think sales and marketing as well as G&A were up quite a bit sequentially. I was hoping you could talk about the drivers there and how we think about that going forward? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Joseph, one of the larger changes between the G&A incline will be the foreign ex that you saw that I mentioned on the call. It's about $2.4 million of delta between the quarters. In September, we had a $1.8 million of foreign exchange, and in the December quarter, we had a loss of about $600,000. So, that \u2013 you can see about a $2.4 million delta with regards to the expenses in that period. Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Could you just kind of lay out what you're expecting from the Broadwell transition? Are we expecting an upgrade cycle? And it sounded like you're expecting that to kind of come into play in the June quarter. What are you looking for there? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Okay. Indeed, we have a very strong Broadwell product line. And it's pretty much all available now. And we already sent a sample to lots of customers. However, as Intel obviously announced it won't be available every date this quarter. That's why we do not expect a lot of revenue contribution to this quarter, but that will happen in June quarter for sure. Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt Dhane with Tieton Capital Management. Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC : Great. Thank you. I was curious. Are you gaining traction like wins with some of the larger cloud customer that you heard, previously weren't able to penetrate? I heard you call out a couple of bigger wins and it sounds like that you're gaining traction there? Was I hearing correctly? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Yes. Indeed. For our cloud based and big data driven company, we recently won favor of them and that high volume deployment is happening I believe is done now and much more will happen again June quarter. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Just to reiterate we did grow about 86% year-over-year so we are gaining as I mentioned, I think, more customers and growing with our existing customers as well. Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC : Okay. Great. And the customer that you did finally penetrate what led to them finally to choosing to work with you? What was the final item that pushed them over and won them into your camp. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Indeed. Some of them have been using our platform before. And now they find that hey, our computer system is even much better. And at the time is brand new. So we won from both segment. Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC : And is there some of the other larger cloud players that haven't previously used you that are on the cusp from your perspective and maybe getting close to finally moving forward and using you in a meaningful way. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think we have opportunities in a number of different customers, I think, in the cloud. And like I said, our applications and our solutions play very well. So I think there's great opportunities for us in a variety of different verticals of our servicing. Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Kugele with Needham. Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, this is actually Kim Donovan for Rich Kugele. Thanks for taking my questions. What phase of buildout are you in for the San Jose facility? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : We're in phase two. Kim, we completed phase one of a five phase program and now we're on phase two. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Phase one just starting (28:23). And that's an another reason why we are able to enable another couple of big customer. And phase two we just begun two months ago. We'll be done by end of this year. Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And can you speak to your confidence in hitting $3 billion in revenue in 2017? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Should be pretty positive. Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Thank you. Very impressive on your free cash flow generation, looks like it was driven by a tightening of the cash conversion cycle that you talked about, despite the 500 basis point Q-on-Q increase (29:07) customer exposure. So can you talk a little bit about more \u2013 about what you did to accomplish this and are the changes sustainable? I.e. is this a new cash conversion cycle that we should be modeling going forward? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Nehal, this is Howard. I mean cash conversion cycle again is somewhat seasonally driven at times too we are obviously continuing to focus on our cash conversion cycle, but we are as we continue to remind folks a very high growth company, so again, it will vary from time to time. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. If you look at over the course of the year though on a year-over-year basis, the cash conversion cycle has been increasing, but I think this is a first time in a while that actually not increasing, I think, it's actually come down a bit here. So do you feel like on a year-over-year basis, it can be stable? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Certainly, on an annual basis. I think you'll see a little bit more stability in that. Part of that has to do with \u2013 also though the growth in our business. We're seeing great opportunities out there to actually invest as Charles mentioned here to invest in our facilities but I think we have great opportunity there and keep catching (30:29). Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Hey, guys? How are you doing? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Good Alex. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Pretty Good. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Howard just want to dial-in on the OpEx here for the March quarter. I'm trying to understand is FX impact. I mean we should be modeling down sequentially on OpEx into March. Obviously, on the seasonal weakness in your revenue. But there's some other factor that would also compound the decline in OpEx from December to March. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Well, actually there's two factors that we talked about. The FX, we took a loss of about $600,000 in the December quarter. It depends upon what the FX rate will be at the end of the quarter. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Right now it looks positive, but it depends on that. The other thing, I'll remind you guys is again employment tax and those things get reset as of December 31. So they come back into play in the March quarter. So that will add a bit to the OpEx. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Should we be thinking about OpEx somewhere between what you did in September and what you did in December just looking at the midpoint of revenue? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think we haven't given guidance there. But at the end of the day, like I said, I think it's about \u2013 I take out the lease look at the foreign ex and you can model that whichever way you like it. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Right. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And then on the gross margin, I mean obviously very strong in December here because of the higher revenue, I expect obviously margin to come down on the lower revenue for March or is it something else going on with the mix where you could be above 16%? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : For the March quarter are you talking about. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Yeah. I'm just saying given the strength you had in December, right. Should we \u2013 is there a chance that it could be flat on margin sequentially or how are you thinking about that at least? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think as we look at the drivers for our margin, there's a couple of things I've mentioned on the call. One is the scale of our business growing, the scale of our business per se (32:47) queue us and the first in power that we came from that utilization as we've always talked is one of those other things too that as we utilized our facilities a bit more, we get benefits from that. Certainly, there's opportunities, but also March is usually a very seasonally weak quarter for the industry as I've modeled that. So, looking back at our history, you'll see some perturbations in our margins between quarters. I think if you look back in December last year comparatively to March, I think you'll see about 50 basis point swing between the two quarters. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board : Thank you for joined us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal third quarter. Our revenue was $532.7 million, it\u2019s 16.6% over from that quarter and 13.1% higher year-over-year. Year-to-date revenue grew 19% over the same third quarter period last year. Non-GAAP net income was $19 million it\u2019s 15% from last quarter and 23.8% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.73 last quarter and $0.47 last year. In the seasonally weaker second quarter, we saw softer market demand than anticipated therefore results for this quarter were at the low end over our revenue due to some softness with some key customers. January and February were particular while March show improved momentum. However, revenue continues to grow at industry leading pace by growing 13.1% over last year. This growth was led by our two strongest segment of [indiscernible] and cloud as well as storage. We\u2019re confident that Super Micro will continue to consistently gain market share and grow multiple times by industry\u2019s growth rate. Strategically, we remain focused on our core market with the cloud and storage which are growing faster than the overall market. In addition we continue to grow our computer system business mostly through our direct sales. Computer Systems Incorporated over a component into a turnkey solutions deliver our data customer experience high revenue and value and account for 70% of our total revenue in the quarter. Internet data center and cloud was 26% of total revenue, up 40% year-over-year. We\u2019re participating in the overall move to the cloud with our key customers in this segment including several order in global cloud data centers. We continue to work closely with these leading cloud industry providers at a scale as well as key new projects leveraging innovative new technologies such as [indiscernible] architecture. We\u2019re very committed to winning in the cloud segment and new designs and architectures to be critical opportunity moving forward. Storage was 21% of total revenue and grew more than 23% year-over-year. Our storage sales to cloud and enterprise customers grew 30% and our sales grew hyper-converged system suppliers who combine our system into their product grew 14%. Our storage products are the best fit for open source software defined storage and all flash NVMe solutions. The application optimize billion box architecture provides the best performance and efficiency for big data and cloud open stack solutions. Our storage solution recently received the innovative [indiscernible] award from IT brand survey. This award acknowledges Super Micro over innovation in system for software defined storage. Slide 5, our core server business remains strong, we continue to be the industry leader in all flash NVMe solutions and are investing to rapidly expand our ecosystem. We now have more than 50 NVMe ready server storage systems to meet the need of any work load. Super Micro\u2019s NVMe solutions actually [indiscernible] and deliver multiple times price performance ratio advantage, our traditional data or SSB solution. The twin portfolio as well as other products reached high record in March. We\u2019ve introduced SIOM networking options of core 1G, 10G, 25G and up to 100G ports for [indiscernible] and Intel based connectivity. At the end of our third quarter we launched the industry\u2019s portfolio, our server and storage systems based on the new Intel GM E5 2600 [indiscernible]. We introduced new products across our entire portfolio of Super server, super storage, super workstation and CPUP manageable products over 200 billion box solutions, we provide customers early [indiscernible] through Q3 to see at our market and expect these new systems to be adopted by our customer base. We continue to expand our product offering and innovation for our rapidly growing storage business. Our storage systems and industry [indiscernible] 48 basis with second of easy access externally driver base. A rate in the patent began shipping in [indiscernible] continue the strong adaption of our maximum capacity for united [indiscernible] storage systems. This system can drive up to nine petabyte per 40 -- and we expanded the offerings with [indiscernible] and storage server option. To address the strong demand and opportunity for embedded and internet solutions we have expanded our product lines with new Intel GM processor SOC and system enabling new cold, warm and hot storage. IOT gateway and compact server providing complete IOT portfolio from the edge to cloud. Our server management sort of in global service continues to be some of our highest margin product lines and continue to grow multiple times faster than the rest of business. The global services business is implementing through year, amortization beginning to compound and improve economical scale for business. Our software defined total solutions based on open industry standard and industry leadings partners continue to grow at accelerated rate quarter over quarter. We announced seven new software defined storage and cloud solution in the quarter delivering end to end solutions with industry medium partners. Slide six please. Geographically United States was 61.3% revenue and was up 19.3% year-over-year. Europe was 17.5% of total revenue and up 5.7% year-over-year. In Asia revenue were 14.7% of the total revenue and up 5% year-over-year. We are seeing that our strategy of folks in North America and Europe is paying dividends income of overall future growth and profitability. We are continuing our global expansion completing new construction phase of our green computing park in Silicon Valley and utilization in our recently expanded European production facilities. Operationally we have managed to get investments in our SAP transition global operation impacts \u2013optimization. Our OY factory utilization rate is about 30%, sorry 60% with extra capacity ready to support our future growth and profitability. We anticipate that this one-time investment will deliver short term and long term benefits to our scale and profitability. In summary our third quarter growth still greatly outpace overall industry growth. Strategically we are well position with both our extensive new product portfolio and our focus in the higher growth storage and cloud solutions. For more specific on the third quarter let me turn it over to Hayes. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis to reflect adjustment to exclude compensation expenses. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company and today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying the conference call. Let me begin with the review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $532.7 million, up 13.1% from the same quarter a year ago, and down 16.6% sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 23.3% led by our growth in cloud datacenter of 14.4% and storage of 23.3% year-over-year. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in the U.S., up 19.3%, as well as growth in parts of Europe and Asia. Our Services and Software business has also grown by 147% which continues to show investments we have made in developing our complete solutions platforms are ramping. The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to seasonal weakness and software demand from larger customers. Our direct customer business was down 22%, and our distributor revenue was down 9%. Complete Servers was down 17.9%, and subsystems and accessory business was down 13.4%. And our cloud datacenter business was decreased by 27.1%. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 69.9% of total revenues, which was up from 64.1% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 71% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4,400 per unit, which is up from $3,900 last year and consistent with last quarter. We shipped approximately 85,000 servers in the quarter and 950,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues at 10.2% cloud datacenter revenues was 26% and storage with 20.7% of quarterly revenues. 61.3% of our revenues came from the US and 45.6% from our distributors and resellers. Slide ten, Non-GAAP gross profit was $79.4 million, up 3.1% from $77 million in the same quarter last year, and down 25.5% from $106.6 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 14.9% for the quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 12.2% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.7% a year ago, and 13.4% sequentially. Gross margins of 14.9% is lower than prior year's gross margin of 16.3% primarily due to lower utilization given the additional investments we have made for our future growth and product mix such as [DCO] servers which were sold which we sold more of this year. Gross margin sequentially was lower primarily due to seasonally and seasonality and lower utilization on a worldwide basis. Utilization on a worldwide basis was about 60% where it has been above 6% sequentially and in the same quarter last year. Taiwan utilization was 51.4% versus 51.2% sequentially and 46.4% in the same quarter last year. Lower utilization was primarily due to reduced revenue as noted above and from the recently added capacity to support the future growth of the company in the US and other ones. These additions are consistent with our strategy go further in other parts of the US as well as increase our presence in Europe. The utilization is based on using a single shift, we do have opportunities to use second shift before making additional investment and further leverage our existing investments. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $51.1 million, up from $42 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $53.5 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 9.6%, which is up from 8.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 8.4% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our new products such as our MicroBlade and Simply Double Storage Solution, as well as our software and support services. Infrastructure investments also for going live on January 1, in the Netherlands and Taiwan on SAT and to launch the corporate reorganization on May 1 to better service our customers overseas have also been made. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to lower marketing and advertising expense and a difference in foreign exchange gain or loss of approximately 0.8 million The company increased headcount by 86 sequentially to 2,567 total employees. Operating profit was $28.3 million, down by 19.1% from $35 million a year ago and down from 46.7.9% from $53.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 5.3%, down from 7.4% a year ago and down from 8.3% sequentially. Net income was $19 million, down 23.8% from $24.9 million a year ago and down 50% from $38 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.36 per share, down from $0.47 per share a year ago, and down from $0.73 per share sequentially. The number of fully-diluted shares used in the third quarter was 53,119,000. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32%, compared to 28.3% a year ago, and 28% sequentially. The rate was higher sequentially, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2015. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31.6% for the June quarter. The company will go live on a global restructuring on May 1, in order to more efficiently support this foreign customer base as such we do expect to see change to our tax rate in the coming years.  Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments were $179.1 million, up $6.5 million from $172.6 million in the prior quarter; and up $67.1 million from $112 million in the same quarter last year. In third quarter, free cash flow was negative $4 million, primarily due capital expenditures of 9.9 million offsetting part by cash from operating activity of 5.9 million. We are working on executing our loan facilities [indiscernible] growth of the company both domestically and abroad. Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by $28.5 million sequentially to $285.7 million, due to lower revenues in the seasoning quarter. DSO was 51 days an increase of seven days for 44 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $7.3 million sequentially to $479.3 million, days in inventories was 97 an increase of 15 days from 82 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $277.3 million, which was 60 days, an increase of 10 days from 50 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 88 days, which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter and was primarily driven by lower revenue and cost [indiscernible]. Now, for few comments on our outlook. In the third quarter, we grew about 13.1% in a seasonally weak quarter in which we continue to expand our product lines when live on SAT overseas and compared for corporate reorganization. Year-to-date our revenue growth is 19.3% for the year as we enter the fourth quarter, we see ramping of the Broadwell launch in a traditionally seasonally strong rev quarter for the industry. However, we are cautious of the current macroeconomic environment. Therefore the company currently expects next sales per quarter ending June 30, 2016 in the range of 580 to 640 million assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.46 to $0.58 per share for the quarter. At the midpoint this will represent a growth of 6% of revenue and negative 9% in EPS from the prior year. This will also represent a growth of 16% in revenues and negative 11% in EPS for the fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. We have made many investments during the past year on our structure as SAP in our corporate reorganization. Two additional facilities are brought in domestically to technology to broaden our solutions, software and service platforms. We believe that many of these investments will put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead and further expand our business and grow the profitability globally. It's currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Now with outstanding subsequent development however, the company may update the outlook or any portion there are at any time. With that let me turn it back over to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. We see significant opportunities with Super Micro to continue our industry leading growth in the next quarter and long term. We are actively participating and leading the IT evolution to the cloud. We are helping the market to accelerate the shift to software defined big data and cloud based solutions. With our extensive application up to many product portfolio and first to marketing innovation., we are well positioned for solid growth in the long term and will continue to outpace overall industry growth story. Operator at this time we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay, great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Maybe couple of questions if I could. First kind of going back to some of the utilization that you are talking about, how do we think about your investments and your manufacturing footprint, you\u2019ve outlined over the past several quarters relative to the demand environment that you are seeing currently and then kind of in connection with that are you still supporting the 3 billion revenue target? Charles Liang : Very good question. Indeed we have been very aggressively expanding our global operation including Asia and Europe. And that\u2019s why we are in better on those factors for CT, to hire people, train people and now our utilization rate although only 60% now we believe that we\u2019ll continue to grow quickly. And as to 3 billion target I guess it won\u2019t be too far away maybe in one or two quarter from our original expectation because of our macro economy. Joseph Quatrochi : So just I\u2019m clear that pushed out from fiscal 2017 and into the fisca1 year over the course? Charles Liang : Yes, maybe from two quarter to end of calendar year 2017. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay thank you that's helpful. And then just one more if I could can you maybe talk about the demand that you are seeing for Broadwell and then maybe the timing of [indiscernible]? Charles Liang : Yes, I mean we [indiscernible] much better performance per dollar and perform well, we did see quicker growth and together we saw NVMe kind of available across our product line, we did, we do expect quicker growth with our NVMe solutions. Joseph Quatrochi : Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And we will next go to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Great, thanks for taking the question. If we look at, let me start at the revenue line if we look at the strong December you guys posted was there an element of pulling in of orders do you think from the March quarter and if the follow-on to that you lifted a lot of areas that were very strong where were some area that were weak whether products or regions and then could you specifically talk about how your government business is doing? Thanks. Howard Hideshima : Hey Mark, this is Howard. Yes with regards to [indiscernible] to say in the quarter between as December and March quarter there was no that I say I think the seasonality is really the big story between the two quarters. Again December quarter was seasonally strong as it was for the industry and quite frankly for ourselves as well then there is some softness that happens right after that in the March quarter. The big difference between the two quarters is primarily seasonality but we did see some softness in some of our customers as well. Mark Kelleher : Any particular vertical? Howard Hideshima : I think you saw that like I said, if you want to call it was pretty wide spread around variety of different markets that we talked about here. Charles Liang : Especially big data center, pricing it would be more competition that's something we saw. Howard Hideshima : Yes, we talked a little bit about the product mix with regards to selling more datacenter optimized products, the DC products that refer to on the phone and that is specifically geared toward the I will call hyper scale, kind of guy. Mark Kelleher : Alright and then just one quick second question. If I look at gross margin and utilization and try to match those up, what should we expect, should we expect that utilization slowly increases and gross margins kind of hang here around 15% or does that get filled up quickly. How do we think about gross margin versus utilization? Howard Hideshima : Yes, Mark we have just brought on board as Charles and I both mentioned, increased expansion primarily here in the US and in Europe to match up with some of the great opportunities that we see there and also our goal is to go on and expand in further parts of the US and in Europe. So again, we are hopeful that as we fill the opportunities up there that we will continue to fill up the demand capacity. Mark Kelleher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz : Hey guys you can hear me okay. Charles Liang : Yes. Alex Kurtz : Hey Howard. So I just want to understand the short form the direct business, it sounds like there wasn't in the datacenter business right because that nicely 26% year-over-year or may be up in the 20s year-over-year. So I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand here is, are there a couple of large enterprise direct customers that you usually sell through the channel that drove the short fall here? Charles Liang : Yes, we are continuously growing in the enterprise as well especially software defined storage and cloud as well. But last quarter unfortunately the big order from some big datacenter kind of slowing down that impact us a lot for the March quarter. Alex Kurtz : I know Charles, but would you classify those orders of those large customers as attritional like internet datacenter customer or more like an enterprise customer like a fortune 100 or fortune 5000 kind of company? Howard Hideshima : Direct sales. Alex Kurtz : What was that Howard? Howard Hideshima : Direct sales. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And then, taking another turn at this Broadwell release, any policy around the Broadwell pipelines as you guys are building up that channel? I know this historically been the air pockets around that kind of a release cycle? Charles Liang : Yes, we do see some customers start to have [indiscernible] for our Broadwell and not just Broadwell, again NVMe solution. Our NVMe solution have been exactly the strongest player at this time I believe. Alex Kurtz : I guess, so would you say that beyond seasonality there was some specific pipeline pause or have new chip releases? Charles Liang : We did have some pipeline waiting for shipping the Broadwell and NVMe solution. Alex Kurtz : Okay, alright. Thanks guys. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : We will next take a question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Bill Grinstead - SIG: Yes, thanks guys this is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. I wanted to take another turn on gross margins here. I know you guys gave a few bullets for why it was more pressured year-over-year but even comparing against your fiscal first quarter, the September quarter similar revenue volume, but the gross margin was still down 50 to 100 basis points and so I was wondering if you guys could lay out for us or weight the impacts of lower utilization versus how your revenue makes in the datacenter that might be able to hone in kind of what gross margin is going to look like going forward? Thank you. Charles Liang : I guess the last quarter another factor to lower gross margin was the market going down right so key component was memory and hard drive prices are lower than before. And other than that utilization rate now we have plenty enough space so we can continue to grow our revenues without investing more on those facilities so that's some positive sign. Howard Hideshima : Just to add to what Charles said to, I understand that we just bought some of our investments on board for our capacity that weren\u2019t there in September. So again, if you are comparing September quarter versus the March quarter with regard to two seasonally weaker, there was some different investment that we just brought online for further capacity and utilization that is in particular this quarter. Bill Grinstead : Okay, great that's helpful. And then, again on the Broadwell launch and you guys have historically spoken about the pause that was just referenced kind of leading up to one of these refreshes. And then, the big revenue quarter, the big paint of demand the kind of unleashes and that would be in the June quarter here. But the midpoint of guidance is up 14% and I understand you guys called out some macro weakness and you pushed out the three billion target of it. But are you guys seeing the normal type of activity that your headquarters testing all the different sockets, the normal type of demand leading into one of these refreshes would you characterize this any differently? Charles Liang : We would be, our growth will be very strong still multiple time or industry average gross rate. However, again the macro environment looks like it will be solved that's why we would be more conservative. Bill Grinstead : And would the softness be characterized on the datacenter side or the enterprise side or across the board? Charles Liang : Yes, we do see kind of [indiscernible] datacenter pricing become more competitive than before. And again, as you know we are selective to take [indiscernible]. Bill Grinstead : Okay. Alright thank you guys. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : We will next go to Rich Kugele with Needham. Unidentified Analyst : In for Rich just sticking with the gross margin at the low end of your guidance range what would you expect gross margin to be? Howard Hideshima : We haven't given specific gross margin guidance on the ranges there, so I think you guys can trace it back along the EPS. Unidentified Analyst : Okay thank you. Operator : We will next go to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Could you talk about the progress you are seeing with the larger enterprise center plus you mentioned your software services were up around 47% year-over-year if I recall correctly I think you were talking about doubling or tripling of that opportunity. So could you revisit that where you guys are at relative here of your expectations one two quarters ago? Charles Liang : Yes, we do see, our management survey defines [indiscernible] for cloud continue to grow quickly. Again 2x or 3x yearly. And we believe this change will continue. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call and I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation, you may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

Now, I'll turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please refer to slide four through slide six. Let me provide you with the summary of our fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was $524 million. It's 1.6% lower from last quarter and 8.6% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $10.4 million. It's 45.4% lower from last quarter and 65.4% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $0.36 last quarter and $0.57 last year. As previously announced, this quarter, our results was below expectation. While we continue to grow in middle-size accounts, our business has become more depend on large datacenter customers. And we had two specific large datacenter customer project that impact the quarter, reduce business from our large datacenter customers result revenue volatility, which in turn lower our manufacturing utilization globally by 14%, which had negative impact to margin and profitability. We are undergoing the restructure of our operational infrastructure, including our global SAP implementation, new global tax restructure and bonded warehouse. These investments will help to streamline the business, improve efficiency and increase profitability in long-term. But unfortunately, to lower our (05:42) costs from business is traction and slowdown in the quarter, that impact execution and pricing flexibility. We expect to complete the whole restructuring in the December quarter this year, and after that, we will be more efficient than ever before. Last quarter, system sales were 65.5% of revenue, compared to 61.7% last year, as we continue to see success in our efforts to grow the higher value total system business. The two key vertical that drive our system business are : first, Internet cloud data center, comprise 18% of total revenue, but had been temporarily slow in the past two quarters; and storage, which was 19% of total revenue, down 15% from last year. However, storage sale to hyper-converged and software-defined market was up both sequentially and year-over-year. And with our strong NVMe leadership, we expect continuous strong growth this year. From a geographical perspective, we saw mixed results. The USA market was 62.2% of revenue, and was flat with last quarter and lower by 8.6% from last year. Europe saw weaker results. It was 17.5% of revenue, slightly lower sequentially, and down by about 16% year-over-year. Asia was in the bright spot last quarter with 15.8% of revenue, up 5% quarter-over-quarter. While we did not achieve the results we want in Q4, we continue to be focused and confident in the long-term growth of our business. We continue to see the move to carve (7:55) the quick growth of IoT and rapid innovation as the drivers of our long-term growth. Our core strategy remain unchanged. First, we focus core market with new innovation and deliver the broadest choice of server and storage system in the industry. Second, emphasize strategic relationship in our key verticals and utilize our server building blocks to create the best value on our application-optimized solutions. Third, continue growth of our software and service portfolio to provide the reliable serviceability and quality for our customers. With the completion of our new global operation foundation, we will target the following specific actions to achieve a stronger growth and financial performance. We are confident that these actions will be successful and will enable us a return to strong growth. First, we will leverage our increase manufacturing capacity and improve operational efficiency to be a more flexible and competitive in winning business in our current large customers and to ensure new major customer wins. Second, we will expand our current focus on our fast-growing Internet of Things, IoT market, which cover Edge server, networking, appliance, surveillance and other embedded solutions. Slide six, please. Let me now comment on our product portfolio, which is at the heart of our strategy. Over the last few quarters, we continue to expand the product portfolio ,and we introduced a number of strong new products and innovations. First, we continue to be the industry leader in NVMe, All Flash NVMe, and hybrid storage solution. We now have more than 60 NVMe server storage systems that deliver orders of magnitude better performance, multiple times the price/performance ratio and efficiency than traditional storage solution, including the Simply Double Architecture and 60 Bay and 90 Bay high-capacity optimized storage platform. We expanded the serviceability and capability of our NVMe system with hot-swappable RAID option and UNO (10:58) dual-port systems. Second, we are ready to deliver an advanced architecture leverage in software-defined solutions, with the introduction of our Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (11:12). Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (11:15), we call SRSD. Now SRSD architecture leveraging our industry-leading product lines to delivery the ultimate in resource optimization on rack platform, rack form factor. This dynamic management technology will enable our data center and cloud customer, especially private cloud customers, to accelerate deployment time and to simplify their management resource overhead. We are an integral part of the deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence solutions, which drive the adoption of today's big data universe structure. This quarter, we have introduced systems supporting the new Intel Xeon Phi x200 processor in both 2U, 4-node and tower form factor. When combined with Omni-Path, our EDR fabric, that delivers incredible performance, that made the research effort possible for more students, professors and the industry. Moreover, we introduced 1U (12:34) NVIDIA Pascal GPU solution, which is capable of supporting up to four P100 GPU \u2013 Pascal GPU I mean, in a slim form factor. We recently delivered a solution to rather university, leveraging the Omni-Path networking, that was recognized as one of the best top 500 HPC cluster. This solution also optimized for transcoding and streaming compression. Our IoT business provides one of the brightest spot this quarter. The worldwide IoT market is growing at about 11%, according to IDC. And our IoT business grew even faster, at about 30% last year, and now account for about 10% of our total revenue, at about $200 million. We can invest R&D resource initially in industrial PC, core IPC, and IoT gateway products. And now we have hundreds of optimized IoT and embedded solutions in just three short years, providing a complete product portfolio from the Edge to the cloud. Just recently, we increased R&D investment, expanding our product line, providing a new, really low power and really small form factor IoT solutions, which successfully engage with customer in medical image, security, surveillance, manufacturing and retail, automation. In short, we expect to see a hopefully more than 30% growth in IoT and embedded market this coming fiscal year. In summary, we had never seen a stronger in term of our product portfolio and our global operation in automation have been significantly improving. We know the urgency to improve and we are leveraging all of our strengths and capacity to create a competitive value proposition for our customers. We are investing more effort in our strategic relationship, building stronger presence in key markets and continue to develop a new customer in target vertical. We are confident these action will result in a greater improvement of our financial performance, when we go into the new fiscal year. For more specific on the fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide nine. Revenue was $524.3 million, down 8.6% from the same quarter a year ago and down 1.6% sequentially. The decrease in revenue from last year was primarily due to our decrease in subsystems and accessories, which was down 17.6%, and a decrease in sales to distributors which was down 14.8%. These are offset in part by growth in HPC, cloud Internet datacenter and next-gen storage of 93%, 6% and 9% respectively. On a geographical basis, we had a decrease in Europe of 15.9%, followed by U.S. at 8.6%, while Asia was about flat. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to weakness in server solutions, which was down 7.8% due to less sales from our cloud Internet datacenter segment, which was down 31%, offset in part by strength in our subsystems business, which was up 12.9%. In addition, next-gen storage grew at 10.8%. On a geographical basis, we had a decrease in the other regions of 31%, primarily due to our cloud Internet datacenter projects. Europe was down 1.8%. U.S. was flat while Asia was up 5.2%. Slide 10, turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 65.5% of the total revenues, which was up from 61.7% the same quarter a year ago and down from 69.9% last quarter. ASP for servers was $4,100 per unit, which is the same as last year and down from $4,400 last quarter. We shipped approximately 84,000 servers in the quarter and 1,165,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 800 customers. No customers represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet datacenter revenue was 18.1%, which was a decrease from 26% in the prior quarter and an increase from 15.5% in the prior year. 62.2% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46.8% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $74.1 million, down 17.7% from $90 million in the same quarter last year and down 6.7% from $79.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.1%, down from 15.7% a year ago and down from 49.9% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 12.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 11.9% a year ago and 12.2% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin results from lower utilization of our global capacity, which is about 50%, compared to about 70% a year ago. This resulted in appropriately 0.5% effect on gross margins. The other 0.3% is attributable to higher inventory reserves on product transitions. Sequentially, gross margin was down due to about 0.3% from lower utilization of our global capacity, which was about 50% to about 60% last quarter. In addition, 0.3% and 0.2% are attributable to higher warranty and inventory reserves on product transition, respectively. Slide 12 and 13, operating expenses were $57.9 million, up from $45.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $51.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses was 11%, which is up from 7.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 9.6% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily in R&D, as we invested in personnel expenses and materials to support the development of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher material and testing fees of about $2.9 million, and higher marketing and trade show cost of $2.7 million to support the development and sale of new products. The company's head count increased by 88 sequentially to 2,699 total employees, primarily in R&D. Our forecast for the next quarter, we do expect operating expenses to decrease as we expect to leverage the investments we have already made, offset in part by annual salary increases. Operating profit was $16.2 million down by 63.8% from $44.8 million a year ago and down from 42.8% from $28.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 3.1%, down from 7.8% a year ago and down from 5.3% sequentially. We will increase our efforts to add additional value to our solutions for our customers, while at the same time, leveraging investments we have made during the past year. Net income was $10.4 million, down 65.4% from $30 million a year ago and down 45.4% from $19 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.20 per share, down from $0.57 per share a year ago and down from $0.36 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 52,955,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 34.4%, compared to 32.6% a year ago and 32% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2016 was higher due to higher tax expenses associated with the implementation of the company's new global corporate structure on May 1, 2016. The impact was about $0.06 per diluted share. We expect the impact to be about $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and to decline as we continue to grow our business offshore and shift our existing offshore customers, who are serviced from the U.S. to locations overseas. We expect our effective tax rate to be 40% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and to decrease as we go forward through the fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 14. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $183.7 million, up $4.6 million from $179.1 million in the prior quarter and up $85.6 million from $98.1 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $5.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $27 million, and net income of $7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $31.1 million. Slide 15. Accounts receivable increased by $3.2 million to $288.9 million due to lower revenue sequentially. Day sales outstanding was 50 days, a decrease of one day from 51 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $30.3 million to $449 million from the lower forecasted revenues. Days in inventory were 94; a decrease of three days from 97 in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $249.2 million, which was 53 days, a decrease of seven days from 60 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 91 days, which is three days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on outlook. As we enter fiscal year 2017, we look to leverage the investments we have made in our operations, such as our SAP implementation, global reorganization, and new facilities, while containing through our expenses to drive growth and profitability in a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects our net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 in a range of $470 million to $550 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company currently expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.15 to $0.30 for the quarter. At the midpoint of this, it would represent a decrease of 2% of revenue and a 30% decrease in EPS for the prior year. Looking forward beyond this quarter, we have updated our targets for the coming two years to be 15% to 17% in gross margin and 6% to 8% on operating margin. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities we have to take market share and keep disciplined control of our operating costs. On July 18, 2016 the company also announced the company's board of directors had adopted a program to repurchase from time-to-time, at management's discretion, up to $100 million of the company's common stock in the open market or in private transactions during the next 12 months at prevailing market rates. To-date, we have purchased 513,194 shares, totaling about $10.3 million at an average price of $19.97. We certainly expect that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company will update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Thank you, Howard. For the entire fiscal year, we saw 11% revenue growth for the year, which means Super Micro is still one of the fastest-growing company in the IT industry. We are much better positioned with our new global SAP implementation, new global operation, and corporate tax restructure and bonded warehouse. Despite softening of our revenue and the temporary setback of our operation this quarter, our long-term growth trend remain intact, based on our even stronger product portfolio, and we are looking forward to a strong new fiscal year. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And we'll go first to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is for Charles. I'm looking at your slide number seven, and I don't see the new server CPU architecture like a Skylake-M. Is that having an impact on your ability to forecast? And how this changes in both CPU and graphics are impacting your server business? And I have a follow-up. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Okay. Thank you. I mean, we have a lots of new design just available like Intel Xeon Phi. We will start to ship high volume now and also like NVIDIA Pascal, we have a product fully ready to ship about this month, I mean, August. And as to Skylake, yes, we have very strong product portfolio, which is also a new architecture. And, unfortunately, it's a product for next year. We have been developing this product line for almost nine months, while daily (28:59) production it will be next year, maybe around summer timeframe. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. And then follow-up question for Howard. Can you please provide some color on a unit and ASP for both server and subsystem segments? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. On the units side of it, for servers, Mehdi, it was 84,000 units for server units shipped during the quarter. The ASPs were about $4,100. On the units for our subsystem and accessories that was about 1,164,000 and quite frankly, I didn't divide out the numbers there with regards to that. It's a mix of number of different things that's really hard to gauge with the ASP there. So we've never given that out. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Sure. And so, did you 1,160,000 units? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : 1,164,000 units. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. Thank you. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Two as well, real quick. So first of all, as you guys go through \u2013 it sounds like a realignment and focus on operational efficiencies. Can you just remind us again where you stand in terms of your manufacturing footprint? And whether or not these efforts have included any reduction of that manufacturing footprint at this point? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yes. Thank you for the question. Basically, it's a big transition, right? Not just SAP implementation global-wide, but also a big impact from our restructure for our production, operation and also global tax, new season. And we also created a bonded warehouse, new bonded warehouse that kind of limited a lot of production decision (30:55). And I would have to say that most impact that people had to pay attention to the new system, prepare (31:03) product here and there, and that's why it slowdown our business a little bit. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : But as for our position, especially, we already finished, I'd rather say that at least 90% job already finished. And in next few months, we will finish everything. And hopefully, the system becomes perfect in early Q4 this year, and after that, our operations should be much more efficient thereafter. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe to ask it a little bit differently. Your updated two-year kind of target models 15% to 17% gross margin, can you help us frame of, what it would take to get to the midpoint of that gross margin range from a utilization perspective from your manufacturing? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : So I think \u2013 as you look at my utilization numbers this past quarter, we had gone to about 70% last year about the same quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's moving down to about 50%. This past quarter, you saw about 30 basis points of movement there. So as you go forward, Aaron, as we increase our efficiencies and what have you, you can see that type of impact to our margins with regard to as we increase our utilization and improve our utilization. So I'd frame it in that way going forward. Anywhere from 30 basis points to 50 basis points, I think, you see them wide spreads on the \u2013 in my commentary on utilization. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And I'll flip one final thing and just housekeeping, no 10% customers in this quarter, did I hear that correctly? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : That is correct. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to focus on the storage side. I'm not sure, I heard everything you were saying about that. Down 15% year-over-year, I think you said, and hyper-converged was strong, I think I heard. Could you just review what you're seeing in storage and what your expectations are going forward? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yeah. The drop of overall storage revenue, I believe, major is about two customers. So we compete with aggressive price from our competition. And because of SAP implementation, I would have to say we are a little bit too slow to dynamically respond to the price competition. So we lost to some big peer there. And this will be (33:38) the reason I believe. However, for hyper-converged, in our software-defined storage, we'll be globally (33:48) though basically. And I believe we will continue to grow very strong in hyper-convergence in software-defined storage. Even for regular storage, I believe, we will recover to peak growth very soon. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: So that was more of a market share loss there rather than a weakness on the... Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yes. In last quarter, we kind of a little bit too slow in an enterprise response. Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. In terms of the Internet datacenter side, do you believe that now with a different margin profile, you would be able to regain business on that side. And how does it work from an ordering cadence? Do they typically order transactionally active every quarter or is it more lumpy than that? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Rich, this is Howard. With regards to that, we've always said that the cloud Internet datacenter has been more project-based, as we're bringing up datacenters from quarter to quarter, or what have you, so it is project based per se. And some of that accounts for some of the \u2013 what range that we put on this quarter. We do have some projects that are either going to be this quarter or next quarter, and we're still waiting to see if \u2013 when those are going to occur. But it is project based. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. And the business that you lost in the quarter, they don't have any issues with your technology or your value proposition right? Is this entirely just basically price or being responsive? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yes. I would like to say in term of technology, in term of product portfolio, we feel much stronger than before. But yes, in term of price competition, especially dynamic price support, dynamic local support we were (35:51) in that quarter. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And, well, I'll take it \u2013 all fine. Thanks. Take care. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Kind of want to follow-up on the same train of thought. Just trying to get an understanding of what really went on in the prior quarter. It sounds as though pricing was the primary issue here and you weren't responsive to the changes in the marketplace. I'm trying to understand what shifted from the competitive landscape and what lesson has been learned that it won't happen in the future? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : I believe the relationship has to be further improved. Kind of when customer asking for lower price, our people did not response quickly enough. And because it's the first time we faced such a big impact, so we then (36:54) \u2013 the whole company (36:57). We \u2013 come our new system. The good thing is new SAP system now we have with us, much easier to calculate our (37:05), so we can response to customer quicker as well. And with our capacity now much bigger, right, so we are more willing to support certain product much more aggressively. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. So I guess I'm looking at a bit of history here and that the hyperscale customers that have driven a lot of a growth for your company over the past couple of years, they have a track record of being very aggressive on pricing. And what I guess, I'm hearing, and I want to make sure I'm hearing it correctly is that, in the future, you're going to be better positioned to react to that price aggression, which may allow us to retain the revenues but would that not negatively impact the gross margin profile of the future revenues? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : I think \u2013 Brian, this is Howard. With regards to that, again, given that we have some excess capacity or additional capacity right now, it allows us to kind of balance out some of those. We may give up a bit on pricing, but we will fill up the plant and reduce the overhead burden that we have by filling it up. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. And, Howard, do you get the sense that anything has shifted from the competitive landscape in that your competitors' ability to customize or to deliver feature-rich products has shifted such that your \u2013 the advantages \u2013 the strategic advantages of the business and its flexibility have altered at all? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, with regards to our products, I think, Charles has said already. We still believe we provide the best solutions and best values out there, bar none, from any of our competitors out there. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Especially, like NVMe, kind of like a dual-port (39:04) NVMe, kind of a like BigTwin (39:06) our new accelerator is coming very soon. And, kind of, I just mentioned that our Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (39:12) [indiscernible] (39:14) and indeed we saw customer engage very well with our new design. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Great. I appreciate the candor, guys. Thank you. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yes. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Great. I just want to follow-up on Brian's question, because I think it's really important that \u2013 well, first of all, was the competitive loss in the quarter really localized to one or two customers? I jumped on the call late, so I'm sorry if I missed that. Or was it misses across a host of customers in the web scale market? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. It was just a couple of customers, Alex. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. And, Howard, I think, as Brian alluded to, and I think it's a really great question is, historically, you guys have always positioned yourself as the application-optimized technology that would maybe be next to an ODM kind of server, right? And you guys added more value. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand here is, was there some very specific situations with those two accounts in the quarter, or is there a sort of like a bigger trend happening with that business, and with that vertical? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : I guess, for that couple customer, it's purely because of our \u2013 I would like to say, a little bit too relax. Sorry to say that, but we should response more aggressively and more dynamically, in term of what customer really need. But to answer your question of application-optimized, yes, we, indeed we've become much stronger than before even, like our NVMe, now the strongest product line in the world, that our (41:13) between the (41:16) design. All kind of, we show customer the advantage from Super Micro. And also I mentioned about our IoT product line, which we grew about 30% last year. This exactly a better margin, a better profit margin product line. And we started to invest aggressively about three years ago, and last year \u2013 first year we see a such a strong growth. And we believe in the next coming many years, we will continue to invest more on IoT embedded. Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. We'll talk a little bit more offline. Thank you very much. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Thank you. I do have a few questions, and I will move to the question of the day. But before I do that, I think you did provide some color around what you expect for OpEx for next quarter. Can you just review that again? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Hi. I mentioned that we are \u2013 we do expect to see a decrease in our op expenses for next quarter. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. And so, should we be thinking that gross margin will be effectively flat Q-over-Q, or are you guys trying \u2013 still trying to say, given you have a very large range for revenue and EPS, but if we take the midpoint, are you guys trying to imply that we should expect gross margin to move up slightly Q-over-Q, or should that be flat to actually down? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think we haven't given gross margin guidance out there. Certainly, we have \u2013 we're doing our best to maintain gross margins, but as Charles mentioned, we're going to be looking at our pricing and our flexibility there as well, to grow our market share, as we always have. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : But I guess start from December quarter, right? Start from October, for example, as our SAP global re-org become much more stable, become more ready. Our iteration (43:26) will grow and our volume per share will grow. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : And that will improve our profit margin... Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : That's correct. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : ...and overall profitability. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Right. And then, you have a wider-than-usual revenue guidance, and I assume that's a result of a reduced visibility. Can you talk about what parts of the business are you seeing that reduced visibility with? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Still, I mean, that our big data center customer, we try to be more cautious this time, because from last quarter, we experienced the first time bigger impact, we tried to be more conservative. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Now, with respect to the question about being more nimble with your pricing, are you explicitly just simply talking about lowering your pricing, get your utilization up, and therefore that will offset some of your \u2013 that will (44:24) allow you to basically have that volume without actually impacting the overall gross margin, because you'll be driving your utilization up, or are you actually talking about more nimbly configuring the products to what the customer needs, to what the competition has out there, to be more optimal in terms of your COGS configuration, and therefore still win the deal? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : I guess it is a combination, plus, now, we have a much stronger manufacture capacity in offshore. So once we are able to leverage that need for CET (45:01) in offshore, then we will know our overall operation and manufacture cost. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay, all right. And then Howard, that financial framework that you gave out for gross margin and operating margin, did I hear that correctly, 15% to 17% and operating margin of 6% to 8% over the next two years? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. And now, when you say over the next two years, are you essentially saying that this is something that we should be thinking about for fiscal year 2018, and fiscal year 2017 will represent an on-ramp towards that model? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : It's a target model out there two years.. now. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. All right. And while you didn't have a 10% customer within the quarter, did you still have a 10% customer for the full fiscal year? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. We did. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Yes. Just looking at the revenue mix, your datacenter revenues have been declining and for the two consecutive quarters. And I'm just trying to better understand, is the ASP pressure coming from this is specific segment or is it more in the core server business? And I have one more follow-up. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Mehdi, this is Howard. With regards to the ASPs, again it's a combination of all of our business. 18% of our business to the (46:34) was Internet datacenter part of it, and you know, there is still another 80%, 82% that's other business areas. So again, it's a combination of all. With regards to that, the last couple of quarters from 26% to 18% (46:49), again we haven't lost any customers, we're still competitive, it's just projects. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. And then... Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : And then, we said, we would try to win those customer back and create more new customer. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : I believe that once our global operations system really stabilize, we will become a bit aggressive in that area. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. And then with the embedded segment becoming 10% of your revenue, are you going break this out going forward so we could better model this? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yeah. IoT will be a very strong territory for us. Again, with our application-optimized as building blocks vision (47:38), we are in a very good position to grow in IoT embedded market. And last year, again, first time we separated product line. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : And we saw a 30% growth. This year, no reason we cannot grow more than 30%. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : So we'll be providing color going forward on and as a separate product line. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. Great. And Howard one for you, the cash cycle went up by three days. Any particular reason here? Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : It's more align to the lower balances underneath, the dividers. We had lower revenues. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Okay. Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : As a follow-up on the declining revenues from the datacenter segment, that end-market itself hasn't seen a decline in demand. Obviously, it's been one of the fastest-growing segments within IT hardware in general, which clearly implies that you guys are losing share to someone, somewhere, even if it's project oriented. Who is gaining market share at your expense and is it purely on price? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : I guess a combination of price and also our response to customer demand. So we have really learned a big lesson how to work with customer closer to response customer demand quicker. So that area, for sure, we very aggressively done and I believe we are ready for that. As to the cost price competition, and that's another reason why we restructured our global operation and production facility. And pretty much, we already are, I would like to say 90% finish. So within next few months, we will have a much stronger operation manufacturer facility and cost structure in Asia. So then we will support our growth in large datacenter business. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : I guess, Charles, the question I have is, who is winning if you're losing? Is it the traditional large OEMs like Dell and HP that historically have been lethargic and unresponsive and not having dynamic product portfolios? Are they winning now-a-days? Or have we seen the lower, more simpler ODMs, the Compals, Foxconns, Hon Hai et cetera of the worlds improve in terms of their system expertise, moving up the food chain, to be more competitive against you? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Basically we saw some from Asia. Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the help. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question today from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up. Two real quick questions. First of all, can you talk \u2013 there has been a lot of talk in the market about component pricing, particularly around drives, but also in the memory space. Have we seen pressures and would you expect pressures from an upward pricing environment on the components to the gross margin line over the next couple of quarters? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yeah. We see some change. I mean, it looks like the market is kind of \u2013 nothing is stable, right? So Q3, maybe, the cost will be a little bit higher, but how much we are higher and what would be the trend, we still pay a close watch. And we try to \u2013 we are prepared, I believe, as the market is changing. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the final question for me would be, in the past, you've talked about kind of the trajectory of how you thought you could grow your revenue. And I think in the framework of the model that you provided 2015 to 2017 at 6% to 8%, I'm curious of how you see, if you look out over the next couple of years, what kind of revenue levels supports let's say the midpoint or even the low-end of that target model range? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yeah, I mean we still are very \u2013 we'll try to be very aggressive to grow our revenue, and that's by end of 2017, we still try to (52:15) revenue, and then we'll have the scale, we will have our cost. And also by a transition production, expanding to Asia now we have our cost (52:28) as well. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I'm really clear here, so you're saying, you expect to be at an annual run rate of $3 billion exiting fiscal 2017. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : By December, December 2017. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Of the calendar year, okay? Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Calendar year, yes. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks. Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman : Yes, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

Let me provide with summary of our first quarter. Revenue was $529 million. It's 0.9% higher than last quarter and 1.8% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $16.7 million. It's 16.9% higher than last quarter and 1.1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $0.20 last quarter and $0.32 last year. We are pleased that Super Micro was able to deploy revenues at above and probably at a higher end of our expectation for our first quarter. Last quarter, system sales were 67.6% of revenue, with 50% coming from direct customers. The key large segment that drive our systems business improved, starting with 23.5% of total revenue, up 10% from last year and 24% from last quarter, against average sales to the [indiscernible] decline in market those performed strongly. We are seeing an increased number of customers as up to all fresh NVM solution and expect strong NVM system growth in 2017. Internet data center and cloud comprised 12.8% of total revenue, down from 25% last year and down from 18% last quarter. We took some times in the past couple of quarters to review our pipeline in this segment. Now we are at with product therefore it would nice with better dilute. We are expecting win in this \u2013 in the near future in this large board of segment. Despite early fair in some margin pressure, we are confident that how datacenter will continue and grow our economical scale in last year. IoT and embedded comprised 10.7% of total revenue and was up 12.9% over last year and up 10.2% from last quarter. A key driver of our success is been the focus on that case in IoT and embedded themes that dive our business. From a geographical perspective, Europe and Asia show strong improvement from last year, with Europe contributing 21.5% of revenue and Asia contributing 18.2%. The US market was 55.0% of revenue, representing ARC balance of US and international revenue. Last quarter we discussed the restructuring of our global operation on inward ratio, including our new SAP implementation, tax restructure and bonded warehouse. This quarter was so much smoother operation and reduced impact from the transition. We expect to 100% complete of that transition in this December quarter and see sustained long-term improvement to our operational efficiency and probability. Now IoT us structural market is experiencing moderate growth according to most of the analyst. But particular segment of the market growing three to four times faster than the overall market. Most of our focus is on the faster growing market segment, like the next generation storage, high density and pre-architectural, rest to be our services embedded and IoT and X-rapid GPU computing. Not other company is better positioned in these market segment, which we are creating big growth opportunity for our business. Our portfolio of workload optimized systems deliver tangible performance and efficiency advantage and we are consistently foster to market with key new technology innovation, that enable our customer to deliver depreciative more powerful and efficient solution. Super Micro is a leader in the next generation storage market, providing NVM all fresh NVM and high storage solution to our customers, including the top storage OENs. We have most completed storage portfolio with more than 70 NVM server storage systems, that deliver all those magnitude better performance multiple times the price performance and vision and traditional storage solutions, including a simple pre-architecture and 60 page and 90 page capacity optimized storage platforms using that new tool and do the NVM interface. We continue to define the stay order at architecture by introducing the first 2U 4A fresh NVM solution with growth system and data pass redundancy bring all fresh NVM to the mission critical enterprise. As a result of our 20 year strategy and investment storage has become one of our largest revenue and faster growing segments. In Rack Scale data center we saw outstanding growth in the quarter while center introduced a micro pace of that. We have several major larger scale customers wins for micro [ph] that were based on micro combination of high performance, high density and networking and IoT efficiency. We also continue to offer most innovative multiple system portfolio including the twin family and [indiscernible] and had consistent growth of that portfolio with particularly strong growth for our micro pace. The rate IQ was special my next hearing market a gross according to most of the entities five particular segments of the Maki growing three full-time fosters in the overall market. Most of our focus is on the foster growing market segments next-generation stories-between potential Rexdale, solutions invented and IOT and X-rated GPU computing not the company is in addition to the things make segment visual Michael, which we have created the gross opportunity for our our credit portfolio of local optimized season fever principal performance and efficiency advantage and we are consistent at 84 circle Maki we skied knowledge innovations that enable our customer for the vitiated more powerful and efficient solutions, supermicro is either in the next generation story to my providing an BMD all flash and we in hybrid storage solution for our customers, including the hot storage organs in the war you have the most the company discourage for you.

How does it. So outstanding growth in the quarter, lower basin the use Michael Brady we had as they were amid your large-scale customers of for Michael Brady that will based on the MicroCloud combination of high-performance-and networking in I yields of low for the policies the most the innovative Maki Pelosi simple for you, including the Queen 73 and Michael Kyle and consistent most of that for weeks, particularly strong growth for Michael, that involve our new away as well underway, and we are starting the transition. I think for and I am working - we've got customers in our teeth amount is over 30 years and for of presentation order next-generation policies which we announced next year and we continue to see hundred percent gross of our software, especially as management sort away in global service portfolio, providing a deputy the speaking and 44 our expanding enterprise customer base our IOT and embedded again, a provider one or the right path or a quarter, we grew approximately three times faster than the overall IOT market as measured by IDC our new reform fiscal junkie and composite provide a higher performance that the The higher performance VCC do that I know you customer networking, communication and stories you reach your more powerful the solution.

Indeed, we are very excited about phase the market opportunity. And at the other companies in a position, we in the idea was special market. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich Kugele : Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions, so I guess first clarification, Howard Can you repeat the growth rates for next in enterprise and HPC, HPC particular I didn't catch it sounded like it was some of the hundred percent is clarify that? Howard Hideshima : Rich, on a year-over-year basis NextGen towards enterprise and HTC in the 36.9% next doors are .7% for 597.5% for the cable and sequential bit NextGen NextGen storage grew at 26.6% and 21.8%. Our practice is to our point okay the PC side is there any commentary you can provide likely the particular environment is going into the unique configurations you can talk to really nice with educational area would think of the 51. Rich Kugele : With regards HPC area that was on the out the platform and was very pleased okay. And then in terms of just where we are in the process recycle. Can you talk about demand for the current series of Intel products and any in the early indications on demand for the future launches next year earlier go and 95 most have been? Howard Hideshima : GPU and 900 and much and then you said available so we have a strong mine oboes the quarter was company and we expect that gross us to in the including not local and ENG for enterprise. We had a strongest product line that will not be the 40 great in growing model okay. And so your sense of how to LNG. Now with Nvidia and until most now we see excellent the queue. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. And congratulations on a strong quarter. Great gross margin and good guidance here. impressive the concept of datacenter sales were down 47% year-over-year and 29% to so you talk a little further about why that ourselves continues to decline on a Q-o-Q basis? Howard Hideshima : Thank you for the kind remarks, we talked about it the quarter as we thought it build out and data centers all last year for cellulose build out that I have been gone for staying Outlook and will technology refresh and demand for your additional client into the data center again audio talk about that within our guided we have great opportunity there to grow as as we go pipeline in that area yeah. So, I like men know you have a one-off most those on the full view quarter. Mike stated, we did not I would say I'm not a couple of floods the site in the private I get into the local and the fees will be. Operator : It appears at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone, have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2017 call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. And now, I'll turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please refer to our slide 4 through 10. I will now summarize our second quarter. Our revenue over this period was 652 million, it\u2019s 23.3% higher than last quarter and 2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was 25 million. This is 50.1% higher than last quarter and 34.1% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.48 per diluted share compared to $0.32 last quarter and $0.73 last year. We are pleased to report an all-time record high quarterly revenue of 652 million which exceeded our guidance. We achieved this record revenue against tough compare, which included a 15% customer last year. Having a more diverse customer set provides a stronger base for our return to our faster growth trends. In fact, we now have minimal customer engagement than ever from the Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies. While most of them are still new partner to us, this means we have viewed our reputation, support structure and production capacity that these large scale enterprise customer trust. With these assets, our strength in long term growth become much healthier in both revenue and profitability. As I have mentioned in the previous quarters, we have been building a much stronger foundation by enhancing our technology, operations and global onsite services, as we evolve into a true tier 1 server and storage solution company. This past quarter, the industry faced so much challenges from tightening in the supply of memory DIMM and MEM fresh. We saw a 30% price hike in some cases, [indiscernible] significantly impact on some orders. However I'm pleased that we are able to overcome this challenge since our relationship with vendors and safety inventory systems are much stronger than ever before and are able to help our customers continue along with their beginnings. Page 8 please, from a geography perspective, our continued effort and investment to expand globally and deliver a better global distribution of our revenue. The US market accounts for 55%, Asia 21%, and Europe 20%. Asia has shown a very strong momentum, up 43% from previous quarter. In particular, our China business where we have focus on technology enabler to our partner in China was very strong and up 53% year over year.  Last quarter, it was announced that Super Micro had partnered with Fiberhome, telecom technology company in China to form a joint venture, to further pursue our strategy of working with local partners. With our 30% stake in the joint venture, Super Micro will share technology and products to enable our local development of solutions for certain important vertical market in China. We do go forward to growing this relationship in years to come. Next page please. Now, let\u2019s talk about specific products. Enterprise private cloud is a key to our revenue growth strategy this year and it grew 221% from a relatively smaller base. We saw outstanding growth in the quarter. Our recently introduced MicroBlade product with several major large scale customer wins in the quarter. Most of them notably a sizable installation happen here, local in Silicon Valley. The data center achieved a super efficient 1.06 power usage effectively, PUE optimized by the MicroBlade\u2019s outstanding thermal structural design. [indiscernible] design also support a record high computing intensity at [indiscernible]. We introduced our fifth generation twin design. The new BigTwin is the industry\u2019s most optimized multiple now twin architecture, supporting the four-inch CPU up to 205 watt maximum memory with 24 DIMM, NVMe empowered by the patented titanium efficiency power. Our R&D teams are really in the developing cycle of our X11 DP products which is based on the next generation Intel Xeon, co-name Skylake processor. We again aim to be the first to market with the optimized Skylake system, process already been underway. We are continuing to see strong 90% year-over-year growth in our combined management and global service business, providing durability, serviceability and quality for our expanding enterprise customer base. As to accelerated] computing solutions, for [indiscernible] artificial intelligence was 6% of total revenue, up 122% from last year. [indiscernible] applications require processing power of multiple GPUs that communicate efficiently and effectively to extend the GPU network. Super Micro\u2019s single GPU system allows multiple GPU to communicate with minimal details and maximum bandwidth. The single one complex PCI-E have been proven to dramatically improve GPU peer to peer communication efficiency over, which we have 221 higher QPI throughput and 60% lower retention compared to previous generation products. Our new 4 Pascal GPU design incorporates the data and reading the GPU interconnect with the independent GPUs team along, ensuring uncompromised performance and stability. The new 4U Design supports up to 10 PCI-E Pascal of GPU and delivers up to 187 tera peak performance per system. The third region was again one of our strongest segment, with 24.3% of total revenue, up 19.7% from last year. Our next generation storage account for 48% of this storage revenue and grew a strong 55.6% year-over-year. We\u2019re ahead of pace and produce All-Flash NVMe systems in the industry, which is 60 plus system available today. We have several significant cloud and enterprise NVMe design wins in the quarter as customer can only find a truly optimal NVMe solution from. [indiscernible], we introduced an advanced SBB platform, the 240 drive All-Flash NVMe dual pass system. Our traditional storage such a simple tablet [indiscernible] driver systems, also so strong growth as many customers prefer to complete the system, build and aided by Super Micro without any superior system quality. We also like it since it significantly improves customer\u2019s quality and service satisfaction. In summary, this quarter we had begun to continue the robust growth pace. That had been our legacy. MicroBlade, NVMe, BigTwin and upcoming X11 Skylake, we have drivers for growth moving forward. With our strong foundation in place, we have more opportunity for large customer engagement than we have ever before in our history, especially our Fortune 1000 enterprise private cloud customers. We expect to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity and reach new high.  For more specific on the second quarter, let me transfer it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP which reflects adjustments to excluded stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements for the company, in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide 4. Revenue was 652 million, up 2% from same quarter a year ago and up about 23.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in subsystems and accessories, which was up 12.3%. This is consistent with the increase in sales to distributors, which was up 4.4%. In terms of verticals, we saw a growth in next-gen storage enterprise and HPC of 55.6, 220.7% and 122.3% respectively. Offset in part by a decline in Internet sales and cloud of 52.6%. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in Asia of 55.9%, followed by Europe at 14%, while the US was down about 12.1%. The 23.3% sequential increase in revenues is primarily due to an improvement in server solutions, which was up 24.2% due to more sales from our next gen and open storage business, which grew 25.4% and 28.5% respectively as well as growth in the internet data center cloud of 31.3%, BPC of 92.3% and our enterprise business of [indiscernible]. On a geographical basis, all regions showed seasonal strength with the US up 21.1%, Asia up 43.1% and Europe up 14.4%. In particular, China was up 71.4% as we leverage our existing partnership and created new partnerships such as the one with Fiberhome Telecommunications Technologies Limited, a major telco infrastructure provider in China. Slide 6. Turning to product mix, promotional revenues from server systems were 68.61% of total revenues, which was down from 71% the same quarter a year ago and up 67.6% last quarter. We began to provide the complete note which we have shipped during the quarter, since we believe it gives an idea of the increasing density which our solutions are providing. We pioneered the concept for multi note systems about ten years ago with the introduction of our twin architecture and continue to lead the way in this area. We shipped approximately 145,000 nodes in the quarter, which compares to 122,000 in the prior quarter and 133,000 in the prior year. ASPs per compute node was about 3100 per node versus 2900 per node last quarter and 3400 per node last year. We shipped approximately 1,214,000 subsystems and accessories, which is up 1,092,000 last year and 1,144,000 last quarter. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet data center revenues was 13.8%, which was an increase from 12.8% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 29.7% in the prior year. 55% of our revenues came from the US and 46.2% from our distributors and resellers.  Slide 11, non-GAAP gross profit was 93.7 million, down 12.1 million from 106.6 million in the same quarter last year and up 16.6% from 80.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.4%, down from 16.7% a year ago and from fifteen 15.2% sequentially. Price changes from resulted in no basis point change to gross profits in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 11.6% of total cost of goods sold compared to 13.4% a year ago and 11.2% sequentially.  The year-over-year decrease in gross margin of 2.3% primarily was due to the cost of memory and SSD component causing cost increases, which we could got pass on to some server customers and as well as many other of our server systems being based on mature late lifecycle processors such as GPU, such as, which mean lower prices. Geographically, we had higher sales in Asia, where pricing is typically more competitive. The utilization on a global capacity basis was lower at about 65.8% compared to 75.2% a year ago. This results in an approximately 10 basis point negative effect on gross margin. Sequentially, gross margin was down 80 basis points, primarily due to the cost of components such as memory and SSD rising during the quarter, causing some cost increases which could not be passed on to some server customers. This is offset in part by higher utilization of our global capacity, which was at 65.8% up from 51.5% last quarter, which resulted in 30 basis points gross margin improvement. Slide 12 and 13. Operating expenses were 57.2 million, up from 53.5 million in the same quarter a year ago and from 55.7 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.8%, which is up from 8.4% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 10.5% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year by 7% primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel to support the development of our total solution and roll over of our new products for the upcoming technology refresh cycle. We increased 139 heads in R&D, which is about 13.8% increase. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher by 1.6 million or 2.8% due to higher sales and marketing expenses due to promotional and trade show expenses of 1.5 million and increased sales payments of about 600,000 due to higher sales revenue and 900,000 higher R&D compensation expenses. This is offset in part by a 1.1 million of foreign exchange gains and 1.1 million lower audit and legal fees. The company\u2019s total headcount increased by 66 sequentially to 2797 total employees primarily in the operations to support the growth of the business. Operating profit was 36.5 million, down 31.4% from 53.1 million a year ago and up by 47.6% from 24.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 5.6% down from 8.3% a year ago and up from 4.7% sequentially. We continue our efforts to leverage the investments we have made during the past year. Net income was 25 million, down 34% from 38 million a year ago and up 50.1% from 16.7 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.48 per share, which was down from $0.73 per share a year ago and up from $0.32 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 2,555,000 shares. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 30.5% compared to 28% a year ago and 31.7% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the second quarter for the fiscal year 2017 was higher than last year due to the reinstatement of the Federal Reserve R&D credit in December 2015. The sequential increase in tax rate was due to -- decreasing tax rate was due to continuing improvement in our new global corporate structure, which will be implemented in May 1, 2017. We expect our effective tactic to be about 25% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 through the release of liability for completion of an audit, tax audit and as we continue to improve our execution of our new corporate structure as we grow our business being served offshore. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were 131.5 million, down 17.9 million from 149.4 million in the prior quarter and down 41.1 million from 172.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative 49.6 million, primarily due to increase in inventory of 101.9 million and an increase in AR of 38.9 million offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of 53.4 million and net income of 22 million. Accounts receivable increased by 38.6 million to 366.9 million due to higher revenue sequentially.  Day sales outstanding was 49 days, a decrease of five days from 54 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by 99.3 million to 599.3 million. Days in inventory were 91, a decrease of six days from 97 in the prior quarter and an increase of nine days from 82 in the prior year. The increase is primarily to support the tied supply of memory in SSP as well as for the shutdown of vendors in Asia for the Lunar New Year. Accounts Payable was up 53.4 million which was 52 days, a decrease of three days from 55 days in the prior quarter and up two days from 50 days in the prior year. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 88 days, which is eight days lower than the prior quarter.  We continue to guide that the cash conversion days and the ratio above should be viewed on an annual basis since there is a seasonality to our business, which affect these ratios quarter to quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter 2017, we see growth opportunity from both a more optimistic economic outlook as well as a multi-faceted technology refresh cycle. Both of these coupled with the investments we have made during the past year have put us in a great position to re-accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve and leverage the investments we have made.  Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 in a range of 570 million to 630 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP per fully diluted share of approximately $0.34 to $0.42 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of 13% in revenues and 6% in EPS from the prior year. The start of a [indiscernible] strategy to take advantage of the options we have to take market share and keep control of our operating costs. In July, 2016, the company announced the company's board of directors had adopted a program to repurchase from time to time at management\u2019s discretion up to $100 million of the company's common stock in the open market or in private transactions during the next 12 months at prevailing market prices. As of December 31, 2016, we have purchased 888,097 shares of common stock, totaling $18.5 million at an average price of $20.79 per share. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments. However, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, how. Although we\u2019re pleased to beat expectation and deliver record high quarter, we are mostly excited to focus and on pace to return to that strong growth trend that have been our legacy with our robust global operation in these foundations and in the chip based server storage product portfolio. Super Micro is well positioned and ready to set a new standard for our industry and to achieve greater things. Operator at this time, we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. This is [indiscernible] on for Aaron. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions if I could. First, I want to go back to, you guys talked about you're seeing the impacts from memory pricing and SSD pricing. Did you by chance, I mean, can you give us any color there, did you sound like in a green and blue supplier like you did similar to your hard disk drive back when they had the Thailand flood? And then just kind of coupled with that, how should we think about gross margin because in the past, we've seen gross margin decline sequentially into the March quarter. So I mean is this -- should we expect a similar trend this quarter? And then I have a follow up. Howard Hideshima : Yeah. Joe, this is Howard. Again as Charles mentioned, we did see some pricing increases up to about 40% plus in some of the pricing between say September and December, but we have taken measures to invest in our inventory as you noticed that we talked about $100 million of increase in inventory and much of that inventory is being invested in component to put us in a good position with regards to the shortages that they exist or tightness that may exist in the market. Charles Liang : And mostly important is we had continued to improve our relationship with key vendors. So as of today, our relationship, partnership have been much stronger than before ever. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to guide a relatively more consistent price. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just on the cloud business, it's down year-over-year. I understand it\u2019s a tough compare, you had a 15% customer last year, but even if you strip that out, I think you\u2019re still down year-over-year, just wondering if you can give any color, what type of demand trends you're seeing there? Charles Liang : Yes. We did have really a huge IDC customer, internet data center customer, but with again a lot of Fortune 500 private customers. And we didn\u2019t, I would anticipate much more [indiscernible] become a more stable for both revenue and profitability. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks for taking my question. On the datacenter trend, it is interesting to see more than 30% sequential growth, but you didn't have the 10% plus customer, can you elaborate on diversification of your customer, are these some of the wins from six nine months ago that is now materializing, any color here will be great to better understand the dynamics behind this revenue? Charles Liang : Yes. As I just mentioned, in last quarters, indeed we went out to a, I would say a Fortune 500 credit card customer and their demand had been consistent and because several of them, that's why it's more or less stable and we believe this trend will continue. Mehdi Hosseini : So you have, you now have more than one significant data center customer and they\u2019re ramping and is there any opportunity to continue increasing the mix of these customers or now you have multiple customers and they're going to continue to ramp? Charles Liang : Both. I believe we continue to have more Fortune 500 private cloud customer. This will drive sales. At the same time, when our capacity allow, yes, we are also open to grow the relationship with POM, internet data center as well. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. And one rather technical question for you Charles, within the ME adoption increasing, do you see a trend with NVMe on fabric and is that happening, how is that going to impact your all flash rate product solution. Charles Liang : A lot of our NVMe solutions are already fabric based. It\u2019s kind of based on PCI\u2019s reach building in our area. So indeed, the last quarter, we have a specific deal because of those technologies, and we\u2019re detecting that in the marketplace and we saw more and more customer like PCI based NVMe solution. Mehdi Hosseini : Would that cause you a risk of marginalizing your all flash array customers or products? Charles Liang : Basically that will improve our profit margin a lot. However, last quarter, the fresh price also raised that up. So it\u2019s kind of partially offset by that. Mehdi Hosseini : But I\u2019m just wondering if there is any cannibalization of some of the other customers that are just more of an all flash array solution. Charles Liang : Yes. We saw more and more customers out there. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D A Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter guys. Just wanted to go back to the component shortages. You mentioned that perhaps you weren't able to pass along the price increases for that. Will you be able to, will you be able to work your prices up to incorporate that. That's the first question. And the second question is, can you just explain a little bit more about how building the inventory helps with that issue. Did you get pricing discounts or buying? Just curious. Howard Hideshima : Hi, Mike. This is Howard. With regards to the passing on pricing to our customers, we are obviously, last quarter, we saw the price increasing quite fast probably in the middle of the quarter. And so some of the contract appeals were already set. Now that we see this out there, we are working with our customers obviously to pass on the differentials with them. So we're actively working on that. With regards to the inventory, how does that benefit us, again, as you see, the prices going up, some extent, we procured inventory, already made the investment into our inventory, so that as prices go up, we do have inventory that we procured at a lower cost to the relative current prices. Charles Liang : Especially because we see some significant order is kind of coming continuously. That's another reason why we keep a higher inventory. Mark Kelleher : Okay. So could we assume that the shortfall or the surprise this quarter will lead to higher gross margins sequentially, is that a safe assumption? Charles Liang : It\u2019s hard to say, because we don't know what way the prices really change during the quarter. Howard Hideshima : We bought some of the inventory, Mark, but then again, it keeps on going, we keep on buying inventory, and there still shortages and things of that nature out there. Mark Kelleher : Okay. And then just a second question, your sub-assemblies and systems did very well, could you just kind of explain the dynamic between that and servers? I know servers have been growing at a pretty good clip and it seems we're having some success back at the subassembly side. What's your thought on that split? Howard Hideshima : Yeah. I think again with some of the distributors, you saw me mentioned percentages with regard to the distributor percentages growing in there. So some of that distributors are coming to us quite frankly with regards to our products. And then obviously from last year, again the decrease in our data cloud is primarily short server systems affected the mix what percentage is between subsystems and assemblies and complete solution. So again, part of that is driving some of the percentages. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Rich Kugele : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a few questions. First when I was just revisiting the gross margin, if you\u2019ve got, I believe you said about ten basis points hit from the utilization and then how, is there any way to quantify the breakdown between pricing versus the component shortages? Howard Hideshima : Sure, Mark. I think if you look at the sequential decrease which was about 80 basis points, probably that's more again, if you take a look at that, I think you'll see that we had a thirty basis points improvement with regard to utilization and quite frankly, the only other mention in my commentary was the component pricing per se. So if you take a look at all the other factors, you probably see a plus 100 basis point impact from the component pricing. Rich Kugele :  Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then, Skylake has come out we believe mid-year and so does your guidance include whatever type of air pocket there might be ahead of that arrival? Charles Liang : Yes. This project will be a big thing to us, however early seeding indeed didn\u2019t stop for much. So I believe there will be not much impact for this quarter. As for the official release from Intel, I believe it\u2019s still of our early Q3. So and a really big impact will be Q3 this year, I mean September quarter and early premier for March can be CRD meeting. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go next to Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks guys and congrats, Charles and the organization on a good quarter here. Just want to clarify, Charles, the Skylake comments. So it sounds like you have some early availability to certain customers in the March quarter for Skylake or the ability to get some initial pricing and benchmarks out to customers in March? Charles Liang : Yes. We start seeding, [indiscernible] much more simple, but really are start seeding, early deployment won\u2019t be a stand much. So how much we can look how with our vendor and our customer. Alex Kurtz : There is a possibility that you can recognize some Skylake revenue in Q2 then? Charles Liang : A little bit in Q1, more in Q2 I believe. Alex Kurtz : And then Q2, sorry, Q3 is when, so the September quarter is when the real ramp would occur? Charles Liang : Yes. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And then Howard on the tax rate, I just want to make sure I got this right, 25% non-GAAP for March? Charles Liang : That\u2019s correct. Alex Kurtz : That's obviously a big step down here. So should we be modeling 25% going forward or you should be normalizing them back to 30% in the June quarter plus? Howard Hideshima : The 25% includes related to a tax audit that we completed. So again that would come out like, I think if you take it down to around the 30% or 32%, that\u2019s the improvements that we\u2019re making. Alex Kurtz : Okay. So the 31 is the more normalized level? Howard Hideshima : Yeah. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And Howard, I think I missed the number of units you shipped for ASPs for the subsystems and the units for the components, can you just repeat that again? Howard Hideshima : Yeah. I\u2019ll remind you, we changed the notes. So for the quarter, we shipped 145,000 notes in the December quarter. That compares to 122,000 notes in the prior quarter and 133,000 notes in the prior year. The ASPs per not was 3100 in the quarter, in the December quarter, 2900 and in the prior quarter and then 3400 in the same quarter of last year. And then, I\u2019m sorry, you asked for the subsystem and assembly. Okay. That was 1,214,000 subsystems and accessories. Alex Kurtz : 1.214? Howard Hideshima : Yes. Alex Kurtz : Okay. All right. Can the emerging storage grouping, you said I think it was up plus, it was up plus 55% for that specific group of customers? Howard Hideshima : Yes. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And then last question, the success in Asia, was that specific to one of these big Internet data center customers or was that just generally the x86 market in Asia this quarter? Charles Liang : I would like it is spread to stable customer. Alex Kurtz : Okay. And sort of larger data center type customers Charles? Charles Liang : Pretty wide combination. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners. Mr. Alger, please check your mute function. Your line is open. Brian Alger : Sorry about that guys. Hopefully, you can hear me now. Congrats on the quarter. Want to dig in a little bit on the subsystems. Obviously, it was good in the quarter, but it's showing growth again and it's two quarters in a row where we've been up year-on-year after pretty steady, pretty substantial declines throughout all of fiscal \u201816. Is there a specific growth driver here, is it tied to the growth that you're seeing in the embedded and Internet of Things side of things or is there more behind it than just catch up in the channel. Howard Hideshima : I guess the major reason is because we just finished our operations there. I mean, in that four quarter, as we mentioned, we spend a lot of effort to build up global operation and including IP implementation and global warehouse. So now, all of those have been ready and global onsite is the most ready now. That\u2019s why we\u2019re able to focus on building it and start to grow and we will be coming soon and also on happening new product line. We do believe that the future will be come back to a strong growth again. Brian Alger : So we should be thinking of the subsystems segment as one of the many growth drivers that are running through the system right now and not being a drag on growth? Howard Hideshima : I guess it grows overall. Brian Alger : Right. Following up on that, the IoT embedded slide, obviously that's now become effectively 10% of the revenue mix. And it's growing at a pretty good clip that market obviously is pretty fragmented and very diverse. Is that a growth rate that we should be at this point or is it just too early days to really get a handle on the forecasting? Charles Liang : Actually I am very sorry, I mean our focus on IOT have been very consistent, growth should be continuous strong. Brian Alger : Okay. Great. And just a house keeping Howard, if you can help us out, you were able off a whole bunch of growth rates for different segments like HBC and whatnot. Going back to the part of the prepared remarks, just say those again. Howard Hideshima : Sure. It was in the sequential or in the year-over-year. Year-over-year, okay. So in terms of verticals, we saw growth in next-gen stores, enterprise and HPC, right, 55.6%, 220.7% and 122.3% respectively offset by decline in Internet based cloud of 52.6%. That\u2019s the year over year\u2019s. Brian Alger : Great. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. One is that, you increased the number of sizable customer engagement, is that, it sounds like that's the mix between hyper-scale and large enterprise customers, is that a correct characterization there? Charles Liang : Indeed in private cloud customer, and based on micro product and some other between [indiscernible]. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And how big of a driver is IBM\u2019s open-power architecture to the large enterprise customer as well as hyper-scale, the increasing number of hyper-scale customers that you\u2019re seeing? Well, so, I think a couple of months ago, there was a press release on IBM\u2019s open-power architecture, winning a key customer and also highlighting Super Micro as a key supplier within that supply chain. So the question is that, is that a big driver in the increasing number of sizable customer engagements that you\u2019re seeing? Charles Liang : We have some customers like [indiscernible] but at this moment, it\u2019s too early to say. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And specifically within the private cloud customer, traction that you're getting, it sounds like you're starting to really break through here, are you seeing good traction across all deals or is it specific to say Asia or specific to the United States? Charles Liang : Indeed, it will stop from USA and East Coast, West Coast, we see a lot of demand. And primarily because of our on-site service, product line, visibility of that. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. My second topic is visibility. Your guidance range is again a little bit no more narrow than the prior quarter and two quarters those are very wide. So I take that as an indication of increasing visibility, is that a correct characterization there? Howard Hideshima : I think that's fair, Nehal. I think like I said, we're coming into the quarter, we're on the edge of a technology refresh cycle. We see a lot of great opportunities as Charles has already talked to about some of the new customers, engagements that we've got going on, those seem to be very good for us. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Has that improved visibility also partially potentially a result of the different way that you're doing or forecasting and it seems that you have a little bit more consistency in being able to hit your targets over the past few quarters. Howard Hideshima : Yeah. If we go back historically, we went through a lot of investments last year with regard to SAT and our warehouse and our reorganization. Those investments have been made and have been into the system for now over a year, or year and a half, so some of those things have helped us improve our overall efficiency for that way. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Liang, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at our end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarize our third quarter. Revenue was $631.1 million. It's 18.5% higher year-over-year and 3.2% lower than the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $20.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.38 per diluted share compared to $0.48 last quarter and $0.36 last year. It was 5.6% higher year-over-year and 20.8% lower than last quarter. Overall, we exceeded our previous financial guidance and achieved our highest financial fiscal third quarter revenue ever. In many ways our revenue result was exceptional. We saw double-digit revenue growth overall and triple-digit growth in some key segments. Our revenue growth was exceed despite of this seasonally challenging quarter. Revenue were achieved despite continuing shortage for memory and SSDs, resulting in a significant components price increase. Compared to last year, our revenue was more broadly distributed across our customer base without relying on any single 10% customer. On the product side, we continue to offer the industry's largest portfolio of server and storage systems and to be first to market with new products and technologies. Customer are anticipating the technology transition to the next-generation Intel Xeon processor-based platforms, codenamed Skylake. We're ready to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation X11 systems, supporting new features and higher performance offered by the Skylake processor and our new innovations. Early shipments of X11 solutions will begin in early May. We introduced a new fifth-generation print design, a 2U 4-node, BigTwin, delivering the highest performing Twin multiple-node system supporting 205 watt 2U Xeon processors, 24 DIMMs and All-Flash NVMe per node. We anticipate the new 8U SuperBlade leveraging the advantage of blade computing with other traditional blade cost of premium and proprietary knock in. Looking at our core markets. We saw strong distribution in -- we saw strong contribution in storage and IoT and achieved triple-digit growth in our enterprise and accelerated computing segment from last year. Storage was, again, our strongest segment with 22.5% of total revenue, up 28.7% from last year. Our next-generation storage partners account for 53.2% of this storage revenue and grew a strong 74.2% year-over-year. Our customers choose Super Micro based on the advanced features and capability of our All-Flash and hybrid NVMe SSD systems. We also saw strong growth in our traditional enterprise storage from the capacity maximized top-loading 4U 90-bay and 60-bay solutions. And coming soon, we will introduce a volume-centric, 45-bay system to the portfolio. Internet data center was 10.7% of total revenue, down 51.4% from last year which included 10% customer. We're working closely with large and medium-sized private and public cloud customers on the new-generation agreements and implementing our super rack scale design solutions. IoT embedded was 10.5% of total revenue and was up 38% from last year. We saw a $10 billion estimated addressable market from age to cloud across the traditional embedded demand. Our IoT embedded portfolio will see continued strong growth. Enterprise private cloud is the key to our revenue and margin growth strategy and grew 578% year-over-year from a relatively small base. Our engagements with the leading Global 1000 companies increased to the highest level ever, including a Silicon Valley Fortune 100 enterprise company with over 30,000 MicroBlades. That is one of the world's largest and most efficient data center with a PUE of 1.06 and 280 nodes per rack LSP. Our management software and global service grew 87% year-over-year, providing the ability, serviceability and quality for our rapidly growing -- expanding enterprise customer base. Accelerated computing solutions for AI people learning, machine learning and HPC was 5.9% of total revenue and saw triple-digit growth of 176% from last year. We offer the most advanced NVIDIA, Tesla and Intel Xeon-Phi and air PGA designs, including 1U 4 Tesla P100 solution and the new 4U design that support 10 GPUs with direct BMA support. New air PGA-based solutions provide compression, encryption and visualization are emerging and we have several air PGA customer design wins underway. Finally, from a geographic perspective, Asia was our strongest geography for growth last quarter and up 92% over last year and reaching 23.9% of total sales. China revenue grew triple-digits, up 138.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our previous strategy for long term investment in global service, management software, engineering, product solution, operation and worldwide manufacturing capacity are finally providing leverage and better economics of scale for continuous revenue, profit and max share growth. We will continue to lead with innovation and being first to market with the most advanced solution for the next-generation processor, new NVMe, new storage architecture, rack design and cloud scale architectures. In summary, we're getting recognized as the new model for Tier 1 solution provider and have been the fastest-growing server and storage systems company in the world for multiple years. Our double-digit revenue growth demonstrates that we're on the right path and our triple-digit growth in key segments and markets demonstrated that our business model and strategy is working well. I'm pleased with the growth in our business opportunity as we enter the new technology driven cycle. For more specifics on our third quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 5. Revenue was $631.1 million. It's a record third quarter for Super Micro, up about 18.5% from the same quarter a year ago and down 3.2% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was widespread in terms of market verticals. We saw growth in storage, enterprise, IoT and accelerated computing. This was offset in part by decline in Internet, data center and cloud. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in Asia of 92%, followed by Europe at 23.1% and the U.S. at 2.3%, while the other was down by 8.5%. The 3.2% sequential decrease in revenues was less than seasonal declines we experienced over the past 2 years of 6% and negative 17%. The improvement over normal historical seasonality was primarily driven by our strength in Asia, up 9.4%; and in other regions, up 20.5%. In particular, China was up 29.3%, as we leverage our growing partnerships. Slide 6. Turning to product mix. Proportion of revenues from server systems was about 70% which is comparable to 69.9% the same quarter a year ago and from 68.1% last quarter. We shipped approximately 139,000 nodes in the quarter which compares to 145,000 in the prior quarter and 126,000 in the prior year. ASPs per compute node was about 3,200 per node versus 3,100 per node last quarter and 3,000 per node last year. We shipped approximately 1,085,000 subsystems and accessories which is up from 950,000 last year and down from 1,214,000 last quarter. We continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet, data center revenue was 10.7% which was a decrease from 13.8% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 26% in the prior year. 52.9% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 15. Non-GAAP gross profit was $88.7 million, up 11.6% from $79.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 5.4% from $93.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14%, down from 14.9% a year ago and from 14.4% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 11.5% of total cost of goods sold compared to 12.2% a year ago and 11.6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points was primarily due to the cost increase of memory and SSD components which we could not pass on to some of our server customers as well as many of our systems being based on mature late life-cycle processors such as Grantley which means lower prices. Geographically, we had higher sales in Asia where pricing is typically more competitive. Utilization on a global capacity basis was lower at about 54.6% compared to about 63.9% a year ago. This resulted in approximately 20 basis points of negative effect on gross margin. Sequentially, gross margin was down 40 basis points primarily due to the cost of memory and SSD components continuing to rise during the quarter which in some cases was over 30% which we could not pass on to some of our server customers. In addition, lower utilization of our global capacity which was 54.6%, down from 65.8% last quarter, resulted in 10 basis points gross margin decrease. Slide 16. Operating expenses were $61.4 million, up from $51.1 million in the same quarter a year ago and from $57.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 9.7% which is up from 9.6% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 8.8% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year by 20.1%, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support the development of our total solutions and rollout of new products for the upcoming technology refresh cycle. We increased 157 headcounts in R&D which is about a 14.9% increase. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher by $4.2 million or 7.3%, primarily due to translation foreign exchange loss of $1.5 million which is a $2.1 million delta from last quarter and $1.2 million higher R&D component -- compensation expense. In authorical the $1.5 million foreign exchange loss represented about $0.02 in fully diluted EPS. The company's total headcount increased by 168 sequentially to 2,965 total employees primarily in operations to support the growth of the business. Operating profit was $27.2 million, down by 3.8% from $28.3 million a year ago and down by 25.3% from $36.5 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 4.3%, down from 5.3% a year ago and down from 5.6% sequentially. Net income was $20.3 million, up 7% from $19 million a year ago and down 18.8% from $25 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis, EPS was $0.38 per share which is up from $0.36 per share a year ago and down from $0.48 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 52,978,000. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 23.7% compared to 32% a year ago and 30.5% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 was lower than last year due to the release of liability for completion of a tax audit in foreign jurisdiction. We expect our effective tax rate to be about 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide 17. Cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments were $110.5 million, down $21 million from $131.5 million in the prior quarter and down $68.6 million from $179.1 million in the same quarter last quarter. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a negative $41.3 million, primarily due to an increase in inventory of $44.8 million, an increase in AR of $24.7 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of $7 million and net income of $16.7 million. Accounts receivable increased by $24.4 million to $391.3 million due to higher revenue at the end of the quarter as customers came back from the Lunar New Year holiday. DSO was 54 days, an increase of 5 days from 49 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased 43 days to $642.3 million. Days in inventory were 103, an increase of 12 days from 91 in the prior quarter and an increase of 6 days from 97 in the prior year. The increase is primarily to support the continuing tight supply of memory and SSD and sourcing for new product lines related to the Skylake launch as well as for the upcoming seasonally strong quarter. Had we excluded the increase in SSD and memory from September quarter and -- of about $62.7 million, our days of inventory would have been 93 days. Accounts payable was $6.8 million -- up $6.8 million which was 57 days, an increase of 5 days from 52 days in the prior quarter and down 3 days from 60 days in the prior year. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 100 days which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter and the same quarter of last year. Adjusting for the effect of the increase in inventory in SSD and memory, as noted above, the cash conversion cycle days would have been 90. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter the last quarter of fiscal '17, we see strong growth opportunities from a technology refresh cycle, especially in the Skylake launch. We continue to see strong traction for our leading solutions in our growing customer base especially in large enterprise. These factors, coupled with investments we have made during the past year, put us on our strongest position to accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2017, in a range of $655 million to $715 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.40 to $0.50 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of 31% in revenue and 125% in EPS from the prior year. It is currently expected that outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. We're now reaping the benefits of our very strong ambitions that we have built over a long period of time. This quarter's revenue was the strongest third quarter in our history and again, demonstrates the advantages of our product portfolio across many different verticals, especially among our enterprise customers. With that, I'm very confident that our strong foundation and products will make Super Micro one of the most successful companies in the IT industry. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. I was just curious. I wanted to kind of double click on the SSD constraints that you're still seeing. Did that impact your ability to fulfill or rather recognize additional revenue in the quarter? Charles Liang : I guess it's both. Because of that shortage, we saw some [indiscernible] relationship and the other reason is that because the price rose, so we had to raise the price to customer. So that, too, did impact our business. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay. And how do you think about that going into the current quarter? Do you see a similar impact? Charles Liang : Looks like both fee dwen and flash memory, SSD will continue to rose in price, but where we also get in accessorized. So won't grow that much as the last few quarter. I would have to say, for example, in module. In last 3 quarter, the price had been grow almost double. So next quarter or 2 quarter I guess, the growth will be slower. Joseph Quatrochi : Okay. And then just for follow up. Can you talk about the timing of Skylake relative to what Mellanox had kind of talked about last night? It seemed like they might be seeing a little bit of a pushout. I was just curious if you're seeing any difference from what we talked about 90 days ago. Charles Liang : Yes, the good news is Skylake, our product have been developing very smoothly. So today, we have almost complete product line ready to ship and we already promised to some customer start ship early next month. And India official launch, I believe, is still early July. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Howard, I want to talk a little bit about the gross margins. Is this the low point, do you think, the 14%? Or do the continued price hikes in the memory mean we're going to dip below that? Howard Hideshima : Mark, this is Howard, thanks. Again, December as a quarter, we don't typically guide gross margin. But December as a quarter is usually a very seasonally strong quarter compared to -- I'm sorry. The June quarter is particularly a strong quarter compared to the March quarter. So typically, it's not as competitive as the March quarter. So we get usually a margin boost from that. However, as Charles alluded to, the tightness in SSD and memory is still out there. We're saying we're doing our best to manage our way through that and have done better, I think, probably in the last quarter versus the September quarter. So we're -- December quarter. So we're going to continue to do that as well. Mark Kelleher : And are you going to continue to build inventory of memory to stay ahead of this? And when do you have the cash, kind of burning some cash here? How do you feel about your cash position? Howard Hideshima : We're okay with regards to cash position, Mark and we have lines of credit that we can draw upon and can expand it and access the capital there. Mark Kelleher : But inventory is still going to go up or putting more memory in? Howard Hideshima : We're preparing right now for the launch -- for the Skylake launch coming up here. So some of the inventory build from this last quarter was for a part of that per se and then part of that was for the larger quarter. So if you look at the end of the June quarter, typically, you'll see a decline in our inventories because we come out of a seasonally strong quarter going into somewhat of a seasonally weak quarter. Operator : And we'll move next to Mehdi Hosseini. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. So it is already almost a quarter of overall revenue and you guys delivered some strong growth in China. What areas of the product portfolio are most responsible for that growth? And I had a follow-up. Charles Liang : For China, I believe still our NVMe and SSD product line have been very attractive in the market. And also, kind of high-density storage as well as GPU for AI, I mean, machine learning, people learning, those areas have been growing very strongly in China market. David Ryzhik : Great. And for next-gen storage, obviously very impressive growth. So 2 questions. Is this an above gross margin business for you? And the other one is just wanted to understand. It seems like some of the larger storage OEMs are pivoting to this supply model for third-party sourcing for hardware. How big of an opportunity do you view this to be? And are you selling any next-gen storage into the enterprise opportunity? And do you see that as an opportunity for you? Charles Liang : Yes. Indeed, next-gen storage will continue to grow customers. And also, our customer are growing. Plus, we have a more -- new architectural advantage for the market. For example coming soon, Op10 from Intel and as well as the people -- some people call JBOF -- JBOD for fresh solution. So we have a very strong product and lots of new architecture is coming. David Ryzhik : Great. And would this be an above gross margin business for you? Charles Liang : Theoretically it will, but because memory and SSD prices are rising very fast, so that may offset our margin for short term. But long term, yes. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. David Kurtz : Could you take us through the dynamics again, Howard, on the data center -- the Internet, data center business? And it looked like one of your strategic 10% data center customers was talking about expansion recently. So that's question one, sort of what are the dynamics in the June quarter guidance around that vertical and what happened in March? And then also, one of your strategic, emerging storage partners was acquired by one of your competitors and was just wondering what the plan is there as far as working with that emerging storage vendor going forward now that they're part of a larger entity? Howard Hideshima : Okay. Alex, thanks. With regards to the Internet, data center, cloud area, we noted in the call that represented about 10.7% of our revenues in the previous quarter, in the March quarter. That's down from 26% last year. You'll recall that we had about a 12% customer last year that we did in the greenfield opportunities and build-outs there. But that's a customer -- still purchasing from, but that's majority of the decrease that happened between years per se. As we talk about going forward, we're still selling to that customer. And again, with the technology refresh cycle coming up, it presents opportunities for us to do, again, not just refreshes with them but with other customers as well. So we're pretty bullish on the Internet, data center vertical for ourselves going forward as well as we enter there. Charles Liang : And the good thing is we start again impede to say lots of new customers, new private cloud especially that help our business grow for long term. And as to the, you just mentioned some of our customer was bought by a big company. We're improving that relationship. So it looks like so far so good. David Kurtz : Okay. So there's no plans on them moving to their own contract manufacturer partners? Immediate plan is to keep it with you guys? Charles Liang : So far we feel pretty good. Operator : We'll move next to Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : On the gross margin, however, just to be clear, the component charges or price increases rather, if it had not been for that, it sounds like then you would've actually had a gross margin uptick Q-over-Q? Is that the correct way to interpret this? Howard Hideshima : Yes, there's still pressure out there, yes. I mean, if you look at the 40 basis points of decline in our gross margin sequentially, 10 basis points was attributable to the utilization per se. If there was not any of this memory type stuff, I believe it's fair to say that we would have gotten most of that back. Nehal Chokshi : So then it would have been flat Q-over-Q had it not been for utilization decline and component price increases then? Howard Hideshima : It could have been higher. I mean, we also had the geographic that was in there that weighed us down a bit. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then data center was already talked about a little bit on the prior question. But that was down Q-over-Q and in the last quarter, there was I think a good amount of excitement of having a more diversified base of hyperscalers. And I think that large prior 10% customer that had gone from greenfield to just sort of maintenance increases, that had already kind of petered out. So I guess my question is that the decline on a Q-over-Q basis of the hyperscalers, was that a surprise? Howard Hideshima : Well, I think if you look at the decline quarter-over quarter, again, it went from about 13.8% of revenues in the prior quarter to about 10%. If you look at our seasonality again and not to say that they're totally tied to seasonality, you'll see us anywhere from 6% to 17% down sequentially over the last couple of years. So some of this has to do with seasonality. I wouldn't say that it was a decline or a loss of opportunities. I think we feel pretty good that we have more opportunities going forward and stronger in that segment than we have in previous quarters. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Very good. By my math, the revenue from the channel, it accelerated quite significantly. Can you put a narrative behind that? Howard Hideshima : The revenue from the channel, again, the percentage of revenues, again, we're -- fairly stable there with regards to our -- them being about 46% this current quarter and then 46% in the prior quarter. So on an overall percentage basis, they were fairly stable. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners. Brian Alger : I guess if we're looking at the quarter, there's -- this time of the earnings season, there's always a bit of mixed news. I'm wondering if the strength relative to expectations from a demand standpoint, was it all attributable to your 2 primary competitors going through major mergers in the past quarter? And if so, if you expect to be seeing any snap-back or any normalization of market share that may have been gained. Howard Hideshima : Yes, Brian, this is Howard. If you talk about like, for example -- one person talked about Nimble and HP in the storage area, our storage area is very strong still. And if it's EMC you're referring to with regards to Dell, going back, it's -- again, in the storage area, we're continuing to do great in the storage area, as Charles alluded to. And we're getting more customers in that base as we go. So again, we're not seeing it slow down or just being -- because of our partners doing mergers that we're gaining more traction in that area. Brian Alger : Okay. I guess it's sort of what I was getting at. It wasn't as much focused on the storage side of it, but rather just whenever a major merger is going through, there tends to be an opportunity to gain share as channels oftentimes get conflicted. But it's good to hear you guys are gaining on the merits of the product portfolio. Moving forward, you guys, it seems as though, are getting some good traction from the AI push and certainly, there is a lot of attention being put towards the GPUs. And I noticed you highlighted the NVIDIA solutions as well as Intel's. How -- do you have a sense for how you stand relative to the competition there? Is there an advantage that you guys might have over, call it, the slower-moving OEMs in this space for that type of a customer? Charles Liang : Indeed, for both storage and GPU as well as Xeon-Phi total market share, I believe we will continue to grow in 2 area. One is we continue to have more customer, especially enterprise corporate customer. And also, we're working with a superscale company as well. So once we have good product, I mean, we're openminded to work with any customer. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll move next to Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : It's Dave Ryzhik again for Mehdi. Howard, can you talk about -- how can we think about OpEx rolling over the balance of the year? Obviously, your enterprise remains very small as a percentage of overall revenue and we'd assume that you guys are continuing to invest in that in the sales and support effort. Just any way to think about OpEx over the balance of the year would be great. Howard Hideshima : This is Howard again. The OpEx this quarter was affected primarily -- one of the major increases was basically the translational ForEx gain/loss. So again, that would -- you can -- we don't predict that per se or fill that into our planning. But again, excluding that, I think the first quarter is always the toughest at tax rates. Our people's tax deductions get reset and what have you. So that rolls into the compensation expense. As we go throughout the year, that gets filled up and it gets taken off from there. Apart from that, we're still focused on leveraging our op expense investment that we have made. So again, grow our revenues faster and we're going to roll our operating expenses and see that leverage drop to the bottom line. David Ryzhik : Great. And just to clarify, the 30,000 MicroBlade deployment, is that in the enterprise revenue category? Charles Liang : Yes, for corporate private cloud basically. Operator : And this does conclude the question and answer session of our conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Let me summarize our fourth quarter. Revenue was $717.9 million. It\u2019s 36.9% higher year-over-year and 13.7% higher than the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $20.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.38 last quarter and $0.20 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was 95.8% higher year-over-year and 20% higher than last quarter. Super Micro achieved new record high in revenue in the first quarter which exceeded our expectations. Throughout fiscal 2017 our revenue was over $2.5 billion or 14% better than last year. We\u2019ve been remarkable is that our fiscal 2017 second half achieved 37.6% growth over last year, which is many multiples higher than the overall industry and any other Tier 1 vendors, which owes our payments rates and some momentum as we finish the fiscal year and coming to a major technology refresh cycle [indiscernible] Super Micro had built a strong foundation, for sustaining high gross, while maintaining profitability every quarter for 24 years. Over the last three year, we\u2019ve made a significant investment in global production capacity operations, system solutions, quality, global service and management software. In [indiscernible] our engineering staff by over 60% bringing the most advanced in both these portfolio of server and storage, global service and management software to the market. [indiscernible] investment that we are proud the new Supermicro 3.0. Supermicro 3.0, positions us as the fastest growing Tier-1 IT Infrastructure Provider, capable of delivering first to market product innovations in global scale with quality, management software, on-site global and support to engage our rapidly growing enterprise customer base. The record high revenue in strong second half growth rate is a direct result of Supermicro 3.0 investment. With the major fundamentals in place and the new Skylake product portfolio shipping, future investment and expenses will begin to flatten driving improved profitability moving forward. The new foundation of Supermicro 3.0 has three potential locations worldwide totalling almost 3 million square feet with a [indiscernible] including dedicated record ever integration, conversion and validation combined this capacity can support annual revenue up to $5 billion on hardware alone. In 2017, we ship approximately 1.2 million [indiscernible] storage notes in systems and subsystems based on [indiscernible] estimates. This [indiscernible] is about 10% over our total number of system shipped in the world. Under Supermicro 3.0, our direct deals in large enterprise datacenter storage and people learning is expanding rapidly. We are seeing significant engagements with large enterprise customer than they were before from Fortune 100 companies in technology, social media, [indiscernible] news media, cable companies and Internet [indiscernible] We are engaging earlier for technology optimization and providing more total solutions which include complete assistance software integration, quality reputation, solution optimization, datacenter management software and global on-site service. Our channel strategy have also evolve under Supermicro 3.0, we are working more closely with the channel and with their end user to provide solutions that drive the demand to our partner. Channel accounts for 46.3% of our revenue, and we are becoming most strategic vendor to those channel partner [indiscernible] which contributed to the gross of total system revenue of 74.3% over a quarter. Under Supermicro 3.0, we also continue to invest in new product [indiscernible] to enhance our [indiscernible] solutions including our [indiscernible] of over 100 new X11 system model based on Intel [indiscernible] solutions have been optimized to deliver the high scale performance and efficiency from the new Intel processor, and latest NVMe innovations especially All-Flash and hybrid NVMe solutions. We have seen our major design wins for our new 2U 4-node, BigTwin offering in both service provider and as well as major storage OEMs. The advanced feature of our 2U 24 OEM [indiscernible] at a major financial service company. And we have seen triple digit growth in our GPU and [indiscernible] system sales. We continue to be the leader in NVMe technology, and our [indiscernible] over NVMe sale is growing dramatically. We secure several new major [indiscernible] specific robotics such as autonomous driving based on our NVMe competitive advantages. NVMe storage delivers orders of [indiscernible] better performance than Chetana Solutions. And we have over 18 optimized designs available [indiscernible] capable of delivering 16 million IOPS, which is one of the highest performance system in the whole industry. Our global service and management software have [indiscernible] for the Supermicro 3.0, they provide a Tier 1 experience for our server and storage portfolio. They create a stronger and deeper relationship with our customers. Our service teams will [indiscernible] with our enterprise customer to provide a high-speed performing in most efficient datacenter in the world. Our software tools are tightly integrate into our customer environment [indiscernible] We achieved $50 million of [indiscernible] from global service and management software in 2017, that is nearly doubled from the last year. And we will continue to double yearly moving forward. With higher margin and amortize the new model to increase profitability overtime. Looking forward, the combination of new Intel [indiscernible] processor and advanced in NVMe product make this technology transition cycle, one with our most significant activity for our customers [indiscernible] Along with the Supermicro 3.0 we have the foundation, the product and a strong pipeline to maximize the advantage of this technology transition. We believe that fiscal year 2018 will be one of the strongest years in Super Micro\u2019s history. For more specific on our fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. Howard Hideshima : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statement of the company in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation and prepared remarks accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the fourth quarter income statement. We end fiscal year 2017 with a record $717.9 million in revenues for the fourth quarter and executing on a number of strategic investments which put us in a very strong position as this technology refresh cycle begins. The investments across a number of markets vertical and geographies around the world have expanded our business opportunities with the host of new and existing customer especially in large enterprise. The increase in revenue from 36.9% from last year was wide spread across our market vertical such as enterprise, storage, IoT and accelerated computing this was offset in part by a decline in IDC. On a geographical basis we had strong growth in Asia, Europe and the U.S. The 13.7% sequential increase in revenue was primarily driven by strength in Asia in particular China once up 35% as we leveraged our growing partnerships. Non-GAAP gross margin was 13.5% down, 60 basis points from 14.1% a year ago and down 50 basis points from 14% sequentially. The decrease from prior year and sequentially was primarily due to cost increases in memory and SSD. Higher sales in Asia, which is typically more competitive and sales of later-stage life cycle products also affected margins. Offsetting these work, operational efficiencies which we have made over the past few years through capacity utilization, economics of scale, more complete solution sales with higher content of software and services. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.5% up 1.4% from 3.1% a year ago and 20 basis points from 4.3% sequentially. The increase from prior year and sequentially were primarily due to growing revenue at a faster pace than our operating expenses. This year, we plan to tighten our headcount and expense control with the goal of continuing to leverage the investments we have already made and drive improved profitability. Net income was $20.7 million up 100.2% from $10.4 million a year ago and up 2.1% from $20.3 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis fully diluted EPS was $0.39 per share which was up from $0.20 per share a year ago and up from $0.38 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was $53 million. Turning to free cash flow on a sequential basis. Cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments were $115.9 million, up $5.4 million from $110.5 million in the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter free cash flow was a negative $12.3 million primarily due to an increase in AR of $92.1 million offset in part by a decrease in inventory net of accounts payable of $40.9 million. The increase in AR was primarily due to higher revenues which accelerated late in the quarter. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 95 which is five days lower than the prior quarter and four days higher than the same quarter of last year. We didn\u2019t expect the SSD and memory issues to last through the end of the calendar year. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter the first of fiscal 2018 we see strong growth opportunities from a technology refresh cycle which is just started. We continue to see strong traction for our leading solutions in our growing customer base especially in large enterprise. Lead factors coupled with the investments we\u2019ve made in our future, during the past few years gave us strong momentum to accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve as exhibited by last quarter\u2019s result. Therefore the company\u2019s currently expect net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2017 in the range of $625 million to $685 million. Assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.30 to $0.40 for the quarter. At the midpoint this will represent an increase of 24% in revenues and 9% in EPS from the prior year. We continue to expect to reach the $3 billion run rate by the end of the calendar year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company\u2019s next quarterly earnings announcement with subsequent development. However, the company may update the outlook or any portion of it at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, Howard. We finished the fiscal year 2017 with record revenue and a strong momentum. Supermicro 3.0 provides the foundation and product to take advantage of this cycle of technology transition. We believe that fiscal 2018, will be one of the strongest year in Super Micro\u2019s history. Operator at this moment we are ready for questions. Howard Hideshima : Operator we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : Hi, thanks. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just a few, if I can. The midpoint of your revenue guide comes out to around \u2013 down 9% Q-over-Q. Just wondering what are the factors there particularly given that year entering the product cycle. It assume that it would be ramping in the September. And I had a follow-up. Thanks. Howard Hideshima : This is Howard. Yes, we are seeing the ramp up as Skylake has launched here. Again, [indiscernible] is seasonally soft and this guidance is about seasonal averages. David Ryzhik : Got it. Thanks. And regarding gross margins if memory pricing was at 50 to 70 basis point hit and I assume it was 70 basis point that would have put your gross margins at 14.2. Given the, in this June quarter, given the high volume, the favorable mix from the lower Internet data center just would have thought that the normalized gross margins would have been higher perhaps from capacity utilization. Can you just talk about what are the other impacts, I mean you mentioned Asia business. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the mix and if there is any kind of pricing impact that we should be aware of in gross margins. Thanks. Charles Liang : Last quarter memory and flash drive grew more than 20% and this quarter although we \u2013 we are seeing an improvement may grow 10% for [indiscernible] for the whole quarter I hope. So the price stay high. And that is why I would try to be conservative because for memory, for flash [indiscernible] are a known factor. Howard Hideshima : And David I\u2019d just add to what Charles was saying with regards to that. Again, we are at the end of the technology refresh cycle when coming into a brand new technology re-price cycle, specifically at the end of the cycle, our pricing gets a little bit more less on the older technology. David Ryzhik : So, I guess the fall would be, should we expect given that you are entering the product cycle the favorable margin impact, should we expect QoverQ increase in gross margins. Howard Hideshima : Yeah, I think the ramp for the product cycle we talked before, it is probably going to be towards the December quarter, you need to take some about two quarter to ramp the production through the new chip set. David Ryzhik : Great thanks so much. Operator : And we will move to our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Great this is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to go back to the September quarter guide and I am talking about that it is a above seasonal, Skylake is going to be more of a kind of December quarter story a ramp, what\u2019s the kind of outline driver for the September guide? Howard Hideshima : Well I think we talked about a number of new engagements and new customers that we are bringing on board. The pipeline is very strong. Joe Quatrochi : Okay, maybe can you talk a little bit about the growth you are seeing in China, what is driving that. Is it the FiberHome, partnership or something else. Charles Liang : Our presence in China continue very be strong and we see a \u2013 we continue to gain a major partner, I mean especially a large corporate. And in that channel we will continue. Joe Quatrochi : Okay, thanks and then just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. I don\u2019t think, and may be I have misheard the manufacturing utilization this quarter and do you think this could be the bottom of gross margin as we kind of work through some of those memory cost increases. Charles Liang : We hope so. Joe Quatrochi : Okay thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners. Brian Alger : Hi guys good afternoon, congrats, on a good finish to the year. Obviously a bit challenging with memory, but congrats on the loss. As you look in, the full year outlook that you talked about, Super Micro 3.0, is there this diversification that you are now enjoying. Is there a new focus for the company or is diversification really the name of the game as we look going forward. Charles Liang : As you may know, we invested a lot, as we grew a 50% engineering manpower. That is why we are able to implement our global service team and we are able to make our service reach, datacenter management, completed already, so we saw those were the I mean now we are able to continue to gain enterprise customer. In 3.0 [indiscernible] last clear miles we won more than 50 large enterprise customers. And deeply we believe we will accelerate the large enterprise customer gaining. Brian Alger : Fantastic. Charles Liang : That mean we are truly integrating function like a two tier one company that which are including service. Brian Alger : Great. And I guess maybe a technical question, obviously storage was a really strong performer in this past quarter up significant both year-on-year as well as sequentially. In the past, historical Super Micro, you guys just ship a lot of JBOD basically. Now you guys have a very strong NVMe product portfolio and I\u2019m curious as to how much of your storage solutions you stays are solid state as suppose to rotational? Charles Liang : And [indiscernible] we grew above 30% in that storage season mobile and looking forward, we will continue to have a strong growth in storage, especially NVMe space. Brian Alger : Is there a margin difference? If we normalize availability of NAND and DRAM. Howard, is there a significant difference in terms of the gross margin that you guys can generate with these NVMe systems as suppose to the JBOD systems that you were shipping previously? Charles Liang : Basically NVMe new technology, we suppose to have much better product margin. However with that shortage, and to sent them we need a much more area because we are past growing. So in that case, we had to pay premium to gain more [indiscernible] that\u2019s why margin was low. Brian Alger : Understood, understood. Okay, thanks, again and congrats on the rest of the year. Charles Liang : Thank you. Howard Hideshima : Thanks. Operator : We move to our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Two part question here, so first memory in NAND flash prices increases for the quarter. How much was that you guys on a [indiscernible] Howard Hideshima : Well, as Charles mentioned earlier, we saw price decreases around 20% within the commentary, I said there has about 50 to 70 impact to our gross margin. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So I guess there is some customers that did not have some price increases where you had an existing fixed price contract. And what I\u2019m trying to get as \u2013 there must have been some percent of customers that didn\u2019t accept that. And A, what is that percent? And then B, it seems like, given the incremental revenue and then there was actually negative incremental EPS as from what I can help that this was actually a negative incremental gross margin business, because they didn\u2019t accept the increase price. So be that correct, and then if that is correct, why honor that contract? Howard Hideshima : Again, the contract was in place, its expiring [indiscernible] you negotiated. So again, we had contracts there. We terminated, but again, the volume went up and a bit hard as a bit as we mentioned earlier in our press release. We\u2019ll soon rectify. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. If I may, I\u2019d like another follow-up questions different topic. At ASP per server really took off, it was up 43% year-over-year and 13% Q-o-Q, what\u2019s behind its a significant increase? Howard Hideshima : Well, I think like I said we\u2019re getting to more full boxes now. As Charles mentioned we\u2019re building our breadth into the large enterprise that customers and if I\u2019m customers are taking full boxes, previously if you remember our server solutions category had everything from barebones to complete services. So we\u2019re now moving or into complete server solutions including software and support services. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll move back into the queue. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Kurtz : Hey guys, can you hear me okay? Howard Hideshima : Okay, Alex. Alex Kurtz : Great. So just on some numbers here, what was the utilization rate in the quarter and what was the merging growth - the emerging storage growth rate? Howard Hideshima : Yes. For the quarter, Alex is about 60% on utilization. Alex Kurtz : Yes. And the emerging storage names. Howard Hideshima : Let me get back to you on that question. Alex Kurtz : Okay. My question for you guys is just taking a deeper look here at the datacenter business obviously IBM was a tough comp in fiscal 2017, but even if you I think exclude IBM out of the datacenter number was down this year in fiscal 2017. Historically the VIP, IDC business has been a good business for you guys. So what\u2019s going on there, even if you exclude IBM, it looks like things were down in this business. Can the IDC business grow in fiscal 2018 at the same growth rate of, as the rest of the business? Charles Liang : Yes, indeed in that year, including last quarter. The major challenge to us was the [indiscernible] memory. Not just the price is high, but in lot of case, we had to wait for memory. So now we have memory and some time we had to wait for refresh. So that kind of intact and that is why we have the best IDC, Internet data center especially. Alex Kurtz : So memory specifically held up projects, Charles, is that right? Charles Liang : Your question, again. Alex Kurtz : So memory impacted your ability to deliver on some opportunities in the IDC space. Is that what you are saying? Charles Liang : The part of the reason, but also because memory price is so high and as you know, internet data center probably margin basically more than it. That is why we had a bad sale in the area. Alex Kurtz : And just last question for Howard, I can get this story somewhat later, but what would stop you from getting back to like a 15% plus gross margin exiting fiscal 2018? Howard, assuming that memory does play out the way, you think it does, and you have Skylake kicking in which always is helpful for you. So why can\u2019t investors think about a 15% plus kind of gross margin on exiting fiscal 2018, if all of those things were to come together? Howard Hideshima : I think it is largely to \u2013 while we talked about here Alex, we have got a numbers of investors, who will be leveraging our investments, being better on our operational efficiencies and operating expenses. So obviously there are a lot of opportunities for us to grow that margin, through this year, especially with the refresh cycle coming. With regard to \u2013 I just sort back on the next-gen it was about 76% year-over-year growth. Alex Kurtz : And do you guys still feel that you did have that one vendor that was acquired by a larger OEM. And that hasn\u2019t impacted your emerging storage business yet? Howard Hideshima : No it hasn\u2019t and probably it would provide with great opportunities going forward as well. Alex Kurtz : To work with that OEM that acquired that company? Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks, one housekeeping question, number of subsystem units? Howard Hideshima : Number of subsystem units was 1 million and 14 thousand. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. And then of the 15 new large scale enterprise customers in fiscal year 2017? Having them began in this quarter? Howard Hideshima : Can you say that again, Nehal, sorry. Nehal Chokshi : So in the presentation there was a statement that there was 15 new large scale enterprise customers during fiscal year 2017. I\u2019m wondering how many of those actually started deployments within this June quarter? Charles Liang : Indeed, [indiscernible] in last year and half of them started move on June quarter. But because it\u2019s new, that\u2019s why the [indiscernible] is not at stake. That\u2019s kind of relatively a very decisive though. Nehal Chokshi : And so, effectively I think it was like a 170% Q-to-Q increase in the enterprise revenue, was that because of all these new large scale customers? Or was it because you had significant expense from the large scale customers? Charles Liang : I tell you majority from the new enterprise customer. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then for those that become Super Micro customers at the beginning of the fiscal year. How has cadence of orders been from those large scale customers? Howard Hideshima : Definitely the opportunities are there and we\u2019re going to be \u2013 as we said earlier the pipeline is very good for us. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Congratulations, this is very encouraging. Charles Liang : Yes. Last year, we won our belief more than 15 large enterprise customer. This year, we will see at least win another 25 or 30. Nehal Chokshi : Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. David Ryzhik : Hi, thanks. This is David Ryzhik again for Mehdi. Just to clarify what percent of total revenue in the June quarter did enterprise make up? And just giving your target of adding 30 new customers in fiscal 2018, do you have a target of what percentage enterprise can make up of total revenue exiting of the fiscal year? Howard Hideshima : Yeah, for the quarter, David, it was about 8% of total revenue. David Ryzhik : Great. And do you have a target exiting 2018? Howard Hideshima : We haven\u2019t put a target out there. Certainly, we have plenty of opportunities. Charles Liang : Hope\u2026 David Ryzhik : Great, great. And just related to that, how can we think about OpEx for fiscal 2018. You do have an aggressive strategy to add onboard these new customers. I would assume they would require some investment yet in your Slide deck you talked about that leveling off. Just how can we think about the quarterly OpEx has moving through fiscal 2018? Charles Liang : Yeah, as in that chart we share with you, last three years we grew about 450 engineers, we have to [indiscernible] and pretty much that whole program already established. So, looking for where we don\u2019t have to reinvest actual \u2013 don\u2019t have to invest the much actual in business. David Ryzhik : Got it. And so, I guess, so no real need to invest in sales and marketing capacity to onboard additional enterprise customers or you feel like you have what you need? Charles Liang : Pretty much ready. David Ryzhik : Okay. Charles Liang : We have to hire more\u2026 David Ryzhik : Got it. Thank you. Yep, thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions and I apologize for kind of joining a little bit late, maybe some housekeeping things, first. How should we think about the progression of the tax rate? Howard Hideshima : In the prepared remarks, this is a new concept for us a bit, Aaron. So, if you look at our website, you\u2019ll see some prepared remarks for us. It will say that we do a guy for this quarter of about 34% on the tax rate. Aaron Rakers : Yeah and I guess I was asking more beyond that. I mean it\u2019s been somewhat volatile quarter-by-quarter over the last few quarters of understanding it somewhat driven by the international mix et cetera. But, again, I think it\u2019d be helpful to understand with some of the taxing that you\u2019ve done over the last few quarters. What should we be thinking about the progression? Where do you think a normalized tax rate kind of falls out for the company? Howard Hideshima : Well, I think, certainly it gets better for us as we go further and go further offshore and increase our foreign presence, but at this point we\u2019re guiding 34% for the quarter. Aaron Rakers : Okay, fair enough. If you didn\u2019t have the constraints this last quarter on DRAM and it sounds like maybe a little bit of flash or SSDs as well. What do you think your revenue could have been? Was that a $20 million impact, $30 million, $50 million? I am just kind of trying to frame how constrained you are in terms of fulfilling the potential incremental revenue? Charles Liang : Indeed, it\u2019s a lot more. Aaron Rakers : I missed that. Was that a lot more? Charles Liang : No\u2026 Howard Hideshima : Aaron, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of managing this \u2013 going through the process of managing this. And so quite frankly we\u2019re delivering orders and doing it. We saw some acceleration at the end of quarter, but again we\u2019ve done a very good job of managing this, going through the process of managing this. And so quite frankly, we are delivering orders and doing it, we saw some acceleration at the end of quarter, but, again we\u2019ve done a pretty job of managing the SSD and memory storage. Aaron Rakers : Okay, how much strategic inventory on memory and SSDs are you carrying, coming out of this quarter? I think last quarter you talked about kind of $63 million of excess inventory. Howard Hideshima : It is similar to that. Aaron Rakers : It\u2019s similar to that, okay. And your current view of when things kind of get back to normal, where you\u2019re executing in a quarter that there is no supply constraints. When would you expect that to be? Howard Hideshima : Yeah, we are not \u2013 we haven\u2019t forecasted that, for say, we said [indiscernible] Charles Liang : It\u2019s in the memory and [indiscernible] program wherever you are getting better from now. So by December quarter, I believe we will see some significant improvement. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then the final question, I am sorry to go back to it, but the Enterprise business growing as much as is pretty remarkable. As that grows and becomes a larger potential piece of your overall business. How do we think about the margin profile of that vertical, relative to the margin of your overall business today? It\u2019s relative to the 13.5% growth. I was just trying to understand, how we should think about that, given what should be a positive mix of software, maybe servers that are wrapped around that traditional enterprise customer base? Charles Liang : Yeah, basically enterprise customer are more [indiscernible] so the margin will be slightly better at least. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Okay, any \u2013 is it 200 basis points? Howard Hideshima : We haven\u2019t quantified that, Aaron it\u2019s going to be better. Aaron Rakers : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Liang, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. Perry Hayes : Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the first fiscal quarter 2018, which ended September 30, 2017. As previously disclosed by the company, additional time is needed for the company to compile and analyze certain information and documentation and finalize its financial statements as well as complete a related audit committee review in order to permit the company's independent registered public accounting firm to complete its audit of the financial statements to be incorporated in the Form 10-K and complete its audit of the company's internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017. Based on these delays, during today's conference call, Super Micro will address business and market trends from the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and will discuss estimated financial results -- but reference to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page at Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Questions should be directed to the company's business update covered in today's call. The company will not address any questions regarding the delay in the filing of the company's 10-K. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Now thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarizes our first quarter. [indiscernible] Super Micro launched last quarter. We have sped up our already strong growth in revenue market share and brand name value. Our new quarter results come from that we had been and continue to be the first tier, growing tier 1 [indiscernible] provider, capable of delivering first-to-market product innovation at a global scale with quality management software service and support. In addition to strong revenue growth, we kicked off several strategical product in strong margin technology market that should deliver significant future growth. Earlier in the quarter, we launched our complete portfolio of new X11 products based on the new Intel Xeon Scalable processor or Skylake family. This launch was the product of over 2 years of effort with about 2,000 of engineer. As a result, we were ready at the launch with over 100 product offering. The X11 business quickly ramp with new systems representing 12% of all processors shipped. The key to the successful ramp was the breadth of our portfolio and our time-to-market advantage with powerful new technology built into the new platform. We will continue to leverage our new product advantage in the coming quarter and ramp continuously. Computer system accounted for a great portion of our business at approximately 75% of our overall revenue. The growth of computer systems, it has been driven by new technologies, such as support of [indiscernible] NVMe, higher memory density, accelerated computing, higher TDP CPU support, and higher bandwidth connectivity. These technologies benefit from our in-house engineering, design and dedication to provide a customer with higher performance, visibility and quality solutions. Moreover, our computer system carry a higher average sales price ASP and strategically increase the opportunity for additional management software and global service revenue. Delivering superior product and data center technology to the market continues to be the cornerstone of our company. And this quarter, we saw strong performance for our twin -- [indiscernible] systems, storage, especially our All-Flash NVMe [indiscernible] platform, GPU-accelerated computing and blade servers. Our new multiple-node BigTwin architecture is one of our fastest-growing new product launched ever. The BigTwin provide both higher density and efficiency than traditional [indiscernible], while supporting state-of-the-art features, including All-Flash NVMe, 24 DIMM memory and the highest-performing Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Our [indiscernible] NVMe server also perform well. With more expandability option, they are optimized for high-performance storage, analytics and in memory application. For example, the 2U [indiscernible] NVMe [indiscernible] platform delivered a record-breaking 80 million tie ups. The design utilize an unbroken architecture allowing [indiscernible] PCI-E band to the [indiscernible] NVMe SSD directly for uncompromised direct connection to achieve maximum storage performance. In storage, which accounted for 20% of our overall business, we saw strong customer demand. Our capacity maximizes top-loading storage portfolio, is anchored by our 90- and 60-bay storage server and [indiscernible]. To strengthen our portfolio and increase customer choice and efficiency, we have started high-volume promotion -- high-volume production the 45-bay storage server with NVMe caching option and high TDP CPU support. We have also launched a new category of 1U peta-scale products. The All-Flash NVMe 1U [indiscernible] of flash; and the 1U SuperServer which support for 32 hot-swappable NVMe SSD providing high-performance capacity at petabyte scale. Think about that, 1 petabyte in 1U. The new 1U NVMe storage server and [indiscernible] provide a shared storage pools. They are definitely becoming the [indiscernible] hardware infrastructure for demanding big data analytic applications, such as autonomous driving and real-time financial fraud detection. Up to 12 host can be directly connect to the 1U pool NVMe storage. Alternatively, for customer who want to deploy an NVMe [indiscernible] solution, hundreds of host can be connect to the high-performing NVMe storage over [indiscernible] or PCI-E. After the market shifted to more flash-based solutions, we see much stronger adoption of NVMe in both hybrid as well as All-Flash solution, especially for OpenStack, cloud and hyper-converged solution. Coming this quarter, our new [indiscernible] NVMe solutions will be first-to-market with truly NVMe-optimized server that provides higher density bandwidth and improved latency for big data analytics and rack scale solution. We are especially excited about our high-performance and accelerated computing business, which was approximately 11% of our total revenue for the first quarter. And that grew more than double from last year. We continue to develop our accelerated computing product line targeting machinery, people learning applications and AI. As we indicated last quarter, we are working with a number of automotive companies for autonomous driving technology, which require accelerated computing as well as NVMe storage solution to achieve that desire compute, IOPS and latency combination. Most recently, Super Micro announced optimized solution for the new NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Our 4U system support up to 8 V100 GPUs with [indiscernible] design for HPC cluster and the hyperscale workload. We also have a single root complex PCI-E design that support up to 10 GPU in 4U, which has shown dramatically improved GPU peer-to-peer communication and performance compared with previous generations. For even greater GPU density and scalability, our 1U solution that support up to 4 V100 GPUs per system or up to [indiscernible] GPU per standard rack. Other than GPU, we have developed a brand-new blade solution featuring the new [indiscernible] family accelerator from Intel. Our 8U SuperBlade can now be configured with a mix of Scalable processor blade and [indiscernible] blade optimized for AI training and inference application. The [indiscernible] blade is just a start of our [indiscernible] learning engagement into this exciting market. By partnering with the leaders, the leading accelerated computing and semiconductor company, we develop next-generation [indiscernible] learning and AI platform. We had invest additional engineering resource this quarter to codesign these solution. They will present us with significant market opportunity going forward. We also launched a new 6U SuperBlade solution designed to future-proof our customers' investment. Codesigned with Intel, that disaggregated architecture enable us independent upgrade for CPU and memory, I/O, storage as well as the power and cooling. This low initial acquisition cost and TCO, the new architecture provide higher return on investment by supporting market for generation of independent technology refresh. SuperBlade and BigTwin system are optimal block for rack-scale solutions. Along with the Super Micro RSD software, our rack-scale total solution empower cloud service provider, [indiscernible] and Fortune 500 company to develop their own agile-efficient software-defined data center. The solution deliver up to 54% improvement in cooling power efficiency, preventing [indiscernible] business solution [indiscernible] with open industry standard [indiscernible] and Redfish API designed to lower management overhead in large-scale data center and other enterprises. Before ending, let me circle back with some detail on business side. From a geography perspective, North America remain consistent at more than 50% of our business. Asia Pacific, our second-strongest geography, [indiscernible] growth, and we expect that it will be more than 25% of our overall business, with China making up the majority. India was lower as seasonal effect impacted result. Here are some updates on a few other key market verticals for this quarter. Our IoT embedded activity continue to represent approximately 10% of our business. Internet data center, IDC, improved due to more project wins, and we expect it will be approximately 10% of our business. The overall enterprise business continue to grow. Our China business is in the range of low-to-middle 20% of our business. Super Micro's momentum of strong growth continue into our fourth quarter of 2018. We recently expect to report revenue for the quarter at the top end of our original revenue guidance, which will be about 29% growth from last year. As I had mentioned earlier, we are initially multiple -- we have initiated multiple high-potential platform codeveloped with our strategic partner during this quarter. We have invest our resources to embrace this new opportunity ahead of us, and we will eventually execute our strategy. In summary, we have begun fiscal 2018 on a strong note. With our fiscal quarter revenue continuing the momentum of the past several quarters, we are fully prepared for the ramp or the technology transition that is just beginning. With our industry-leading product line now shipping, we are on track for a $3 billion run rate in the December quarter. Let me now turn the call over to Perry. Perry Hayes : Thank you, Charles. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session in which sell-side analysts would -- permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we have provided. We will not answer any questions related to the delayed filing of our 10-K. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alexander Kurtz : I have to say, this is unusual circumstances. So I have to say the questions I need to ask are related to the business update. And hopefully, you can touch on them at some level. What gives you the confidence to provide forward guidance into the current quarter given that the audit committee is reviewing transactions that may still be part of the business today? Perry Hayes : Thanks very much. It\u2019s a good question. We feel pretty confident that in the revenue number that we've indicated today, that it is within a prudent range. And even though we really can't provide a total -- a complete baseline yet because 2017 isn't finalized, we do feel confident that within this range that we've indicated, at $675 million to $685 million, that it is an appropriate range. Going forward, we are continuing with the momentum of business that we've had in the past, if you look back to starting with last December, and it's based on a great mix of new customers and market verticals that are all growing, as you can see from what we've reported. So we feel pretty confident. In addition, as we've been saying for several quarters as well, we think that we'll end the calendar quarter at a $3 billion run rate. And Charles has just reiterated that in his remarks. Alexander Kurtz : Okay. I'm just still a little confused by why even go out on a limb and provide December guidance. But maybe just it\u2019s something you just can't talk to right now. Perry Hayes : Well, we do think it's important to provide trend and the growth indicate -- direction of growth. And it was also indicated in the current quarter number, which we just provided you as well. Charles Liang : But again, I just mentioned, I mean, $3 billion run rate should be achievable. Alexander Kurtz : Last question for me. Can you give us any update on your CFO, Howard, and his status with the company at this point? Perry Hayes : Howard is working very hard on the issues related to the filing of the 10-K at this moment. Operator : We'll now take our next question with Brian Alger with Roth Capital partners. Brian Alger : Just for a clarification point, reading through the release today and kind of going back to the delay that we're incurring here on the 10-K. To be clear, what's being evaluated by the audit committee isn't whether or not the revenues were real, but rather not the documentation around which period the revenues were recognized, is that the case? Perry Hayes : Brian, as indicated, we're not going to answer any questions related to the filing of the 10-K. Brian Alger : Okay. I thought it was in the press release today, but okay. Coming back to the update with the margins that you guys -- the range of gross margins that you're providing, it would indicate that we're not seeing any improvement in the dynamics from the memory side of the equation. Is that still what's pressuring the gross margins at this point? Or has there been a shift from product dynamics? Charles Liang : Yes. I guess the memory price [indiscernible] is a little busy this quarter again. But this mean we have a good inventory, I mean, in good relationship with vendor. So we believe business will continue to grow smoothly. Brian Alger : Okay. And are you continuing to purchase inventory in advance for key customers, specifically memory inventory? Charles Liang : Kind of mixed. But the overall memory is in good condition -- in a good condition, I would like to say overall. Perry Hayes : Yes, I think you can safely say what we've been doing over the past several quarters, we are continuing to do that. We are continuing to hold inventory going into the quarter. It's still not enough to see us through the whole quarter. As we've talked with investors previously, we are, during the quarter at some point, still acquiring inventory to support our customers. Brian Alger : Okay. And then other than the efforts going on surrounding the review here with the 10-K, has there been any structural changes that would affect the operating expenses of the company outside of normal business operations? Perry Hayes : No. Everything is pretty much the same. We have a great business. We wanted to do this business update because it is a very strong business. It is growing very strongly, and we have tremendous opportunities. As Charles mentioned in his remarks, we have great opportunities in new projects with some of the leading semiconductor companies for revolutionary designs in AI. And as a result of that, we've added some engineering headcount in the previous quarter. That is one of the things that impacted operating expense somewhat this quarter. But no, everything is on track. Charles Liang : Especially the new processors, Skylake and NVMe product line have been all ready to ship. So we believe that business will continue to grow strongly. Brian Alger : Okay. And then just one final one. You mentioned IoT and data center each being roughly about 10% of the revenues. I'm curious how the storage business was tracking for the company, given how fast that's been growing for you guys over the past couple of quarters. Perry Hayes : Yes. Storage business was -- we called out here that it's greater than 20% of the entire business. It continues to grow. In fact, I think you could say this quarter, we actually saw our open storage grow a bit faster based on some of these designs, which Charles called out, especially the top load, especially some of the NVMe solutions, they're growing very rapidly. Charles Liang : For the big data, AI, HPC, and we have been growing very well, including storage solution in -- for that market. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : There will be no presentation or CFO commentary because, obviously, the results have not been audited yet, correct? Perry Hayes : That is correct. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Charles did run through some of the vertical data. But Perry, could you just run through that one more time real quickly. I'm sorry. Perry Hayes : Yes, sure. We said storage was greater than 20% of our business; accelerated computing, also 11% -- well, greater than 11%. IDC was approximately 10%; IoT, again, approximately 10%; channel was sort of mid- to low 40% of total business; and enterprise was approximately mid single digit, call it, 5%, a little bit more than 5%. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And the reason why there's more uncertainty around what channel was as a percent of revenue is that that's where the uncertainty resides with the one revenue recognition. Should be getting done. Is that a correct interpretation? Perry Hayes : Again, Nehal, we're not going to discuss anything related to the 10-K filing. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. All right. And then what's the status of the repurchase program? I believe that it was -- it expired, and I think you repurchased close to $20 million at one point in time. Would you guys consider opening this back up? Perry Hayes : Yes. Your numbers are correct. We did have it. It expired in June. It has not been reauthorized. Nehal Chokshi : Would you consider -- is there a proposal on the table or consider proposing it to restart the repurchase program? Perry Hayes : It always is something that's in the back of our minds. At this point in time, we want to invest in our business to provide a greater return for shareholders. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And it sounded like inventory is up Q-over-Q and, therefore, your cash conversion cycle continues [indiscernible] year-over-year. Because you're making sure that you have enough inventory to fill up demand, is that correct? Perry Hayes : That is not correct, Nehal. We haven't provided that level of detail. Cash was up somewhat higher than it was on the previous quarter, and that's pretty much the extent of what we've provided. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : I know one of those numbers -- Perry, could you reiterate what percent of revenue was Skylake? I think that was given out. Perry Hayes : Yes, what we talked about is X11 platforms. X11 platforms represents the Skylake. It also represents -- a portion of it is UP and DP. But overall, X11 represented approximately 12% of the total processors that we shipped out. Mark Kelleher : And those processors typically carry higher gross margins, those systems, correct? Charles Liang : Basically. Perry Hayes : Yes, they do. Mark Kelleher : So that didn't seem to help the gross margins in the quarter. Is that being offset by the memory issue being a little bit more significant? Perry Hayes : We can't -- well, as we've been saying, we're very much in the early days of the ramp, okay. And the DP portion of X11 is still ahead of us. We'll get a little bit more here in the December quarter, probably improve quite a bit. And then really, the ramp starts to take hold beginning the calendar year. As you know, that would be about 6 months since the launch, and that's when -- there starts to be a lot more allocation in the market. Gross margins, overall, were impacted by seasonal utilization, impacted by geographic mix with strong China revenue, impacted somewhat by product mix to more component-reliant systems. Plus, we're also in this transition phase from a mature Grantley life cycle technology to the new Xeon Skylake family, and so that's still going on. And yes, there were some continuing component pricing at SSD and DRAM issues. Operator : It appears at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today, and we're looking forward to talking to you at the end -- in the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Questions should be directed to the company's business update covered in today's call. The company will not address any questions regarding the audit committee investigation or the delay in the filing of the company's 10-K. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Let me summarize the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue were in the range of $840 million to $850 million surpassing our quarterly guidance and exceeds our long term guidance of reaching the $3 billion of run rate by December 2017. The long term investment to grow our large enterprise customer base along with our investment in global operational infrastructure, data center management software, and global service continued to increase in revenue and non-GAAP profitability. We were also able to improve our non-GAAP operating margin and EPS by increasing over side and control of our operational spending growth. In this seasonally strong quarter we achieved over 30% revenue growth year-over-year and we saw the [past supplement] throughout our quarter. We grew in all market vertical including accelerated, AI, machine learning, storage, IoT embedded, Internet data center, cloud and particularly strong growth with large enterprise customers. Our completed season business reached more than 175,000 nodes which result in an increase of our season business to approximately 77% of our total revenue. We also grew in every geography, with the biggest growth again being in Asia Pacific and in China specifically. Our performance this quarter demonstrated that our aggressive execution on Supermicro 3.0 is a great strategy to grow our business. We saw accelerated growth in design wins and revenue with large enterprise customers. Expansion in large volume sales to Internet data center and growth in our traditional channel business as well. We are also seeing a strong ramp of our new system Tesla Intel scalable process of family. The Skylake product now grew more than 100% quarter-over-quarter. With the new X11 Skylake systems, we introduced much leading innovation, the BigTwin system featuring 4 new processor node in 2U and truly a product unmatched in the industry. It is the industry's only non-comprised multiple solution that delivers the best-in-class hyper convergence and efficiency, while also supporting fuller performance 205 watt CPU, 24 DIMMs for maximum memory, All-Flash NVMe, low latency and expanded I/O flexibility. We are seeing strong growth across multiple markets with the product and we just fully enhanced the product with [indiscernible] design delivering an extra 30% performance gain in certain applications. NVMe flash storage continues to play a major role in our surface with our open traditional storage platform growing 47% year-over-year. Super Micro's new All-Flash NVMe 1U JBOF NGSFF All Flash and 1U SuperServer with support for 32 3.0 NVMe or Internet ruler NVMe or 36 Samsung NGSFF NVMe more than key product All-Flash storage capacity of previous 1U solutions and we are provide petabyte scale storage in a single 1U system. We also released new All-Flash NVMe system design for high performance storage delivering up to 18 million IOPS with latency under 10 microseconds. While orders are steadily growing large enterprise customer base, we announced that to get any certification of SAP HANA on Supermicro 2U for popular SuperServer with up to 6 terabyte of memory and All-Flash NVMe or SSD leveraging high memory processing speed and multiple core processor technology. Our SAP HANA solution is capable of running advance analytics alongside high speed transaction and get accurate real time routes. We want to partner with NASA to have expanded their research capability. To meet NASA's Center for climate simulation needs for expanded advanced computing and data analytics used to start the earth, solar system and universe. We deployed a turnkey next-scale solution already built and integrate at our Silicon Valley headquarter. The Super Micro effective base solution have expanded NASA's research capability with the combination of density, system performance and optimized cost bringing an additional of 1.5 better flow to NASA research. 11 years ago we introduced the concept of green computing with power optimize and energy efficient systems. This quarter we were pleased to take a green computing to the next level with industry first resource savings architecture that expanded green computing beyond just power savings for our overall conservation of various inter resource. The resource saving architecture contributes to a greener data center and deliver property savings in operating cost and up to 40% savings in hardware system application cost. It reduces resources consumption using versus depreciation and depreciation to more optimal performance quicker. The architecture is a beauty in key Super Micro innovations including our this aggregate MicroBlade design the resource pulling of our latest shaper and storage server product [indiscernible] and our open industry standard next scale design management are aware. We also expanded our Silicon Valley manufacturing headquarter with a new rack integration facility to support the increase capacity of rack scale deployment. The facility features one order largest clean energy, fuller autonomous rack scale integration and manufacturing size. In summary, Super Micro's momentum our strong growth increased in our second fiscal quarter of 2018 and we exceed our target for $3 billion annual run rate based on our customer wins and from pipeline business. We expect to continue this growth in the upcoming quarters. Moving forward, we will remain highly focused on executing our Supermicro 3.0 strategy and increasing the large enterprise customer base. Let me take at this time to introduce Kevin Bauer, our new CFO. Kevin joined Super Micro over a year ago as the Senior VP of Corporate Development and Strategy. Kevin had over two decades of experience in financial leadership including multiple CFO role for high tech company here in Silicon Valley. I\u2019m looking forward to Kevin\u2019s contribution in the success of Supermicro 3.0. Let me hand it over to Kevin for some brief comment. Kevin? Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles and good afternoon listeners. For those of you who may be new to Super Micro, I have just succeeded Howard Hideshima as CFO. Let me take a few minutes to summarize my background which was provided in a press release earlier today. Prior to joining Super Micro, I was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Pericom Semiconductor Corporation from February 2014 until its sale to Diodes in November 2015, and thereafter, assisted Diodes with the integration of Pericom until November 2016. Prior to that, I was Chief Financial Officer of Exar Corporation from June 2009 through December 2012 and Corporate Controller from August 2004 to June 2009. Between these roles, I gained additional experience by assisting a CFO colleague in his effort to bring a company current in its SEC filings. Since January 2007, I've been at Super Micro in the role of SVP, Corporate Development and Strategy. During this period I have focused on financial planning and analysis to further strengthen our forecast capability. I now have a number of experienced financial planning and accounting professionals that have joined my team. I believe this broadly experienced talent will bring additional value when combined with the existing dedicated accounting staff with deep Super Micro experience. We announced our preliminary financial information today in today's press release which you can refer to. Looking forward, the company expects net sales in the range of 700 million to 780 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending March 31, 2018. While we work to complete our number one priority of compliance with our SEC filings, we will not be making any comments on the preliminary financial results. Again, I'm excited to work with Charles just as Super Micro is ramping and I look forward to engaging with our investor community and sharing more about our progress after we have met our SEC filing requirements. Let me now turn the call back to Charles and Perry for Q&A. Perry Hayes : Thank you. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session now in which sell-side analyst will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We will not answer any questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K. Operator, at the time we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Few questions if I could, first I think last quarter you gave us kind of some details related to some of the segments growth like high performance computing, enterprise, storage stuff like that. Is there anything you could give us this quarter to help us out? Perry Hayes : Yes, certainly we can do that. Again these are preliminary numbers, so these are our best estimates at this time. Storage was about 22% and of our total revenues and that is up about 22% year-over-year. Our Internet data center cloud vertical was over 11% and let me go on here accelerated computing again over 10% this quarter, the amazing thing about the accelerated computing is that it grew about 134% year-over-year so that\u2019s continuing to show a lot of momentum. Our IoT and embedded was approximately 9% and that was up also about 23% year-over-year. Enterprise was approximately 7% and continues to show very strong growth based on this huge revenue base that we have for this quarter. Last but not least is our channel and that's about approximately 42% or so. There is a little bit of overlap as you know from prior times we spoken that some of our businesses captured in channel and where they do some things for some of our customers. Is that helpful? Joe Quatrochi : Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up to that, when we look at the due performances this quarter relative to the guidance that was laid out, how do we think about what was the underlying driver for the upside, was it broad-based or is there any particular market or partner you could point to? Charles Liang : Overall growth will continue to be very strong other than there is some component shortage global wide. So we believe growth will be continued pretty soon. Perry Hayes : Just would add here that as we said in Charles remarks earlier that it was very broad based. Every single vertical was up and we were up in every geography. Joe Quatrochi : And then maybe just one more and I\u2019ll see the floor. The management resignation that you outlined in the press release how - specially related to the sales leadership. How do we think about those relative to the audit that was just completed are those related or they're separate and then how do we think about your ability to forecast revenue kind of going forward? Perry Hayes : So, just as you know - that we wouldn't comment on the audit committee investigation and the delayed financing 10-K and definitely we\u2019re not at liberty to discuss anything related to the audit committee. So I\u2019m going to have to decline your question on that, but with regard to we did announce a new person to head up our sales our worldwide sales, his name is Don Clegg, that was in the press release only today. He is a great guy. He in the company for many, many years. He is often stepped into the role when people were absent in traveling. So he has a wealth of knowledge about the company and how it operates. With regard to forecasting future, Kevin would you like to make a couple of comments. Kevin Bauer : Yes, I think first I\u2019d say that like most companies of our size we have a bottoms up process for forecasting and there are many players that are very savvy and very skilled in terms of doing the forecasting. That is one of the areas that I've been working on as well to kind of really focus in terms of our estimates for our top customers. So I think we have the wherewithal and the bench strength to be able to do that well in this time of transition. Charles Liang : In past I mean in that solid four years we had been - we are prepared for Supermicro 3.0 so which is higher and change not for internal sales expertise. So our team is becoming much stronger than before ever. Operator : And our next question will come from Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Congratulations on very strong revenue result, I kind of expected a little more to drop to the bottom line. Could you talk a little about gross margin, your expectations there, I know we kind dipped again memory pricing maybe worked that in. And then talk about the operating lines if you can in terms of, is there increased spending I know you said you\u2019re going build out and you are building up the finance team a bit is there more G&A. Where can we expect some puts and takes on the operating expenses? Thanks. Charles Liang : Basically our revenue have been growing very strong. In next couple of quarter we are continuing our stronger trend. However, our memory price still go in higher unfortunately. So net margin gross margin have been about flat, I guess like so other than that our business have been very strong and we foresee a very strong growth in the next few quarter, at the least. Perry Hayes : I\u2019ll just add to that, it sounds a little bit like last quarter. We had geographic mix with very strong China revenue. We continue to have product mix where a lot of our products have more component reliance to them so that impacts that. And again we're still in the Grantley lifecycle technology. So, as Charles mentioned in his comments that our Skylake grew 100% but it was also a low base. So the big part of the ramp on Skylake is still ahead of us. We said that now for the last several months that beginning 2018 we will start to see that that go higher. And then lastly - based on the report of our estimated EPS, you can probably tell from that that we did make some significant progress in terms of our EBIT margin. That was up significantly as we were able to control OpEx. Mark Kelleher : Just one last one the tax rate with the changes in the law. What tax rate should we be assuming? Kevin Bauer : So I think as we go forward our tax rate will probably going to be in the mid-20s or so. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Group. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. So just wanted to get a sense of deadlines that we\u2019re working with, I think in January you filed an 8-K regarding a bank extension suggesting that you have to file by March. Just wanted to think up on that to see 5th March is really like a deadline that you\u2019re working with for the 10-K? Perry Hayes : David we are working as hard as we can with - in conjunction with the independent auditors to try and complete this process as soon as possible. But as we have already described at this time, we\u2019re not able to really determine the date when that will happen. We do have a NASDAQ extension until March 13 and our bank line with Bank of America we have an agreement which we've previously announced that sinks up with that March date. David Ryzhik : And I mean is that a hard deadline that March date with Bank of America or do you anticipate flexibility around that if you need a little more time? Perry Hayes : David we\u2019re not going to comment about our discussions with Bank of America at this time. David Ryzhik : And so we came across some order from TSMC to Super Micro, there is some public filing. Just wanted to get a sense of what therefore I think it was - there was a $40 million order to Super Micro in December quarter and maybe we saw follow on orders. So just wanted to get a sense of what those order are for is that Internet data center business or not and how sustainable is that demand from that customer? Charles Liang : Basically we don\u2019t comment with specific customers with business condition. However I'm happy to share our big win with lots of large enterprise account had been continuing going very strong. So we do feel very positive. We will continue to grow in this segment. It\u2019s kind of indeed many enterprise customer had been growing business with us. David Ryzhik : And you touched on the component environment, would just love to get sense on how you see DRAM and NAND today relative to your business and how you anticipated impacting your March quarter? Charles Liang : Yes, DRAM price continues to grow temporarily, and other components even [indiscernible] we did see some shortages global wide. Basically our growth have been much faster than the average overall industry. So we did see a shocking challenge but with getting stronger relationship with our vendor. So there are some challenges but I believe it will be okay. David Ryzhik : And just wanted to get a sense of - there was a public discussion around the meltdown inspector vulnerabilities. How do you foresee that to impact the Skylake cycle? Do you actually believe that could actually drive some incremental refresh activity? Charles Liang : Yes, good question. I mean our Skylake indeed grow more than double over last quarter and we did see a strong growth this quarter and next coming few quarter. So, our overall Skylake will go strong but overall next generation business is strong. So especially we have lot of embedded IoT customers. So overall our growth will be pretty smooth I believe. David Ryzhik : And then just last one from me if you can talk about storage, I think you gave a total storage was 22% of total revenue but any sense on next-gen storage? Charles Liang : Next-gen storage continues to grow year-over-year stably and some quarter grow more, some quarter grow less but overall next generation storage will continue to grow strongly. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Congratulations on the strong results and at least dropping some of that rather seeing the 10 million OpEx year-over-year increase result and then operating profit increase on a year-over-year basis, so that\u2019s good to see. The guidance for the March quarter brought while relatively broad range at the midpoint and price will be done 12% Q-on-Q which is an average I think is usually down the mid single digits. So what greater levels of seasonal decline that you guys are projecting? Charles Liang : We believe growth will be strong in March quarter even if this seasonally slow quarter but because of that shortage, I mean component shortage global wide so we try to be more conservative not over a big range 700 to 780. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then\u2026 Perry Hayes : Nehal, I think just add as well, as you know - for the industry historically there's lot of seasonality in this March quarter right with the lunar New Year and some of this other events that are happening. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to gauge with that, plus all the comments that Charles made. Nehal Chokshi : And then what was the reason for the resignations of the sales leadership? Perry Hayes : Nehal, appreciate your question but I don't know whether you're listening earlier. We\u2019re not at liberty to discuss the audit committee investigation. Nehal Chokshi : So I just point out by saying that you\u2019re not at liberty to say that then the assumption will be that those resignations are indeed related to the audit in some way or another. So, hopefully you can give a little bit more color as far as what\u2019s the driver here? Perry Hayes : Again Nehal your conclusion is your own, that is nothing that we have said or discussed in any of our press releases and we are not going to discuss the audit committee investigation. Nehal Chokshi : And then I did have one more question which is audit related but I think it's clarification so hopefully you can answer but just to be clear - what was close about the audit committee's investigation was that it was purely on the revenue recognition timing is that correct did I recall that correctly? Perry Hayes : That is what we have said in previous press releases. Operator : And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we're looking forward to a strong 2018. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go-ahead, sir. Perry Hayes : Good afternoon, and thank you, for attending Supermicro's business update conference call for the third quarter fiscal 2018, which ended March 31, 2018. As announced in our press release earlier today, the company has completed the previously disclosed investigation conducted by the audit committee. In furtherance of the preparation of the financial statements, the audit committee is overseeing additional testing that the company believes is nearing completion. To date, the company's cash flows have not been impacted by the findings of the investigation or the additional testing. Additional time is required to analyze any impact of the results of the investigation and additional testing on the company's historical financial statements as well as to complete additional reviews before the company will be able to finalize its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Otherwise known as the 2017 10-K. The company presented an updated compliance plan to the NASDAQ stock market hearings panel on April 26, 2018. And the company requested an additional exception period for continued listing of its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, through August 24, 2018, in order for it to complete and file its 2017 10-K and subsequent delinquent SEC quarterly filings. The company is unable at this time to provide a date as to when the 2017 10-K will be filed or to predict whether the company's historical financial statements will be adjusted or, if so, the amount of any such adjustments. The company intends to file its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, promptly after filing the 2017's 10-K. Based on these delays, during today's conference call Supermicro will address business and market trends from the third fiscal quarter of 2018 and will discuss estimated financial results. But reference to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close regular trading and is available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you, that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Questions should be directed to the company's business update covered in today's call. The company will not address any questions regarding the audit committee investigation or the delay in the filing of the company's 10-K. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarize the third quarter. Our third quarter revenue will be in the range of $785 million to $795 million, which surpass our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 26% increase year-over-year. This was the sixth straight quarter of double digit -- 20%-plus growth, which demonstrates the success of our Supermicro efforts to scale our people, process and operations to support strong customer demands. On a year-over-year base, we grew in almost all market verticals, including growth of 102% in accelerated AI machine learning. 244% in enterprise, 58% in Internet, data center and cloud, 9% in IoT and embedded, 14% in channel and 15% in storage. In a traditionally soft quarter, we were able to succeed despite shortage of both minor and key components. But results could have been stronger even not for the component shortage and supply chain uncertainty. Our systems revenue reached 80% of total sales, demonstrating our customer confidence in our integrated products and total solutions. The total number of nodes shipped last quarter was up by 13%, compared to last year. We shipped over 1.2 million total units, including subsystems and completed systems in 2017 calendar year, and we are also recognized as the third largest provider of server in the world by IPC at the end 2017. ASPs of node grew 28% over last year. Due to increased demand for fully integrated systems with Supermicro qualified and validated components. Most of them notably the SuperBlade and the [indiscernible] Twin family were in high demand and contributed to higher ASPs. The Twin family was 30% of total revenue and was up 72% year-over-year. The SuperBlade was up 470% compared to last year. Other higher ASP products including rack solutions, which was up more than 300% and other systems that grew about 10%. [Indiscernible] computing has also been a priority at Supermicro and we have introduced our new resource savings architecture to further improve data center cost efficiency and environmental friendly entities. The system architectures can achieve up to 60% hardware acquisition cost savings. By the using of system [Indiscernible] cables, power supply, networking, processor modules, storage modules and cooling fans. Furthermore, resource saving systems are capable of achieving 1.5 PUE in data center to save millions of dollars in energy costs, while significantly reduce waste. More resource saving advantage can be realized in the scaled data center environment, leveraging Supermicro rack scale design, or RSD, to manage racks of disaggregate server, throughout composable storage and networking with industry standards Redfish workflow API. We have already had larger scale deployments and a design win with our strong resource saving products portfolio including a disaggregate ray and BigTwin and other products in our enterprise and large data center customer base. That resource savings technology drives dramatically improved efficiency. Increased utilization, reduced initial acquisition cost and TCO. Most importantly, it can help our mother earth because of reduced pollution and energy consumption. From the new technologies, Supermicro continues to bring numerous breakthrough innovations to the market. For storage, we've introduced a new highly configurable 1U All-Flash storage platform. Supporting the latest storage media such as [Indiscernible] Flash and the Samsung NF-1 NVMe that deliver up to 300% decrease in storage density, with significantly higher performance and bandwidth at a scale. For AI and machine learning we've introduced the broadest selection of GPU server platforms supporting NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs in both PCIE and FXM form factors. Now 4U GPU system. In particular, can support up to 8 GPU from a single root with the update NVLink, offering optimal performance in a hyper scale environment for application in self-driving car, smart-tv, healthcare, scientific research, Big Data analytics and more. On the Networking side, we are the first to introduce a wide range of 25G NIC solutions that deliver 100% better performance per dollars, backward compatibility, plus a future-proof upgrade path to 100G. Supermicro also recently announced new additions to its extensive IoT, network edge and security appliance portfolio, featuring systems based on the new SOC, System on Chip, Intel Xeon D-2100 processor, with high RAS features available in ultra-dense, lower power device. Supermicro's X11 IoT platform delivers balanced compute, storage and networking for the intelligent age and the emerging scale -- emerging cost of new 5G-enabled service. Lastly, to support increasing demands, we extend our Silicon Valley operation to over 2 million square feet, which does, when opening of Building 22 at our computing campus. The expansion allows for additional capacity for system integration and a dedicated rack integration for [CETs], powered by one of the Silicon Valley's first green source energy. At 3-megawatts, the facility features automated rack burn-in with autonomous guide robot in operation. Currently, 60 racks are built and burning simultaneously, with capacity of delivering more than 600 computer racks per month. In summary, Supermicro is continuing to execute on its Supermicro's Supermicro 3.0 strategy and drive a market share gain in total solution and direct end-user engagement with large enterprise and data center customers. Our [6th and 60th] quarter of double digit growth, despite of global components shortage, reflects our advantage of first-to-market technology and products, which will continue accelerate customer demand for Supermicro. And let me hand it over to Kevin Bauer for more financial details. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, listeners. In addition to the growth rate Charles highlighted on a year-over-year basis, I'd like to provide a longer-term view of our performance. Our success as the third largest supplier in a growing market, it's evidenced by our performance in the following areas, by comparing with the last 12 months to the preceding 12 months. In other words, the last 12 months, as of March 2018 revenue, compared to last 12 months, as of March '17. In the area of accelerated AI and machine learning, our last 12 -- our last 12 months' performance was 148% over the previous 12-month period. In Enterprise, our last 12-month performance was 162% over the previous 12-month period. In IoT and Embedded, our last 12-month performance was 19% over the previous 12-month period. And in Storage, our last 12-month performance was 28% over the previous 12-month period.  Turning to the quarter and sequential comparisons. This quarter we saw our strongest regional growth in EMEA, that was up 63%, offsetting slow performance in China due to the lunar new year holidays. The U.S. remained our biggest market with approximately 46% of revenues. Our estimated range of GAAP gross margin is from 13% to 13.2% and includes stock-based comp of 0.4 million and this quarter accelerated building depreciation expense of 2.6 million, that's related to a partial demolition of a building in our new green computing park. Without these two items, our estimated range of non-GAAP gross margin is from 13.3% to 13.5%. Despite continued component pricing pressure, our gross margin remains stable. I'd like to make a few comments in specific areas of progress made over the last quarter. In financing, we recently closed an expanded new credit facility for an amount of up to $250 million. That increased our domestic borrowing capacity by 60%. In addition, this new facility provides a conversion opportunity to expand borrowing capacity to $400 million, after certain conditions have been met. With this new source of capital, we increased our network of relationship banks and are able to invest in additional working capital to continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy. At the same time, we have exercised our organization to improve on all three facets of the cash conversion cycle, by focusing on customer collections and being more precise about payments to suppliers and the scheduling of incoming inventory materials. We immediately reduced our outstanding balance from the prior loan and that will partially offset the interest related to the loan rate increase during Phase I of the loan facility. In our sales organization, we are pleased with Don Clegg's leadership of the sales team. He has summoned the team's bench strength to step up to new challenges. He has further upgraded the team to bring enhanced professionalism and stronger strategic selling capability to bear in our efforts to win and serve our target customers. Don is emphasizing a stronger team approach, utilizing the company's technical experts, to improve customers' experience. The sales team is retooled and ready to compete and will help us fully achieve Supermicro 3.0 objectives. The SEC filings process. As we stated in our press release and as Perry articulated during the introduction, we continue to expend great effort to complete our financial statements and work with our independent auditor to complete the fiscal year 2017 audit process and ultimately file our delinquent reports with the SEC. As previously indicated, we'll now have a Q&A session, where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I'd like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we just provided and we'll not answer any further questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Husseini. Charles, regarding the enterprise, it seemed pretty strong, 244% growth. Can you offer any more metrics around maybe customer growth? Whether that is solely in North America or globally? Just any other insights would be helpful, and I had a follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes. In enterprises we continue to grow very strongly. Primarily as U.S. based, because of our on-site service and kind of management sort of we all ready now and we also start to extend to Asia and Europe. So, it's kind of global available now. And we anticipate the strong growth to continue. David Ryzhik : And just on gross margins, would you be able to comment on component conditions? I guess, your estimate for gross margins suggests, maybe, flattish -- you see revenue tick down seasonally but year-over-year you grew revenue very strong and you noted that China was a little weak in the quarter. So just wondering, what hampered your gross margins from kind from growing -- from expanding more, given the volume? Charles Liang : As you may know, DRAM and SSD price is getting stabilized, especially as SSD is slightly dropping now. So, this is we're ahead -- or looking forward at gross margin as ERP. And plus, our economical scale continues to grow, they were ahead too. Perry Hayes : I think one other little unique item for the quarters is that we took a little bit more in E&O provision as well. David Ryzhik : What percent of systems were new processors? In the March quarter? I think you've provided that in the past? Charles Liang : It is 100% [indiscernible]. Perry Hayes : So, we're talking about Skylake? David Ryzhik : Yes. Perry Hayes : So, it looks as if -- as a percentage of revenue for Skylake this quarter was roughly about 18%. Charles Liang : And it came from stably growing in last year. David Ryzhik : I think it was 12% a few quarters ago, any reason why it's not accelerating further? Or you guys just think that the tail is going to be longer? Or when do we reach that 30%, 40%, 50%? Charles Liang : I guess it's still maybe two quarters away. Talking about 40%. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : So, I want to go back to the component side of the equation, as you look out over the next couple of quarters. What -- you mentioned that SSD pricing starting to come down, I think your word was slightly, how are you seeing component pricing and availability play out? Not just out over the next quarter or so. But looking into the second half of the year, there's been some -- some questions about whether or not, particularly, [Indiscernible] flash and DRAM would tighten back up into the second half? Charles Liang : Yes, as you may know, right. DRAM continues to have a certain shortage. But much better comparison than before. While -- they see kind of a pricing is gradually dropping now, so that means that the price is more than enough. However, we did see global other components in shortage, including PCB and material and all others small components like PPL. So, it was surprising. But that looks like those small components shortage may continue for many quarters to go. Aaron Rakers : And can you quantify how much of an impact that has had on your ability to generate revenue? How much more revenue would you have generated if it weren't for some of the component shortages? Charles Liang : I would have to say that more components global shortage had impact our revenue last quarter, even the March quarter. But looking forward, we continue to enhance our relationships and our effort to create a better relationship and a better safety inventory. So hopefully, that impact won't be too big. Aaron Rakers : And then kind of a couple of other quick questions if I can. It looks like your cash balance continues to kind of come down here a little bit. You're definitely doing some things on the debt side. So, I'm curious of how we should think about, it looks like utilizing your revolver with -- while still having about $140 million in cash. So how am I thinking about, I guess, why use the revolver? How do I think about the capital management side for the company? Perry Hayes : Yes, so under the new revolver as I mentioned we, upon getting funding, we actually drew down less than what our existing balances were. And what I was trying to signal to you, as we go forward is that our cash balances will probably be smaller than they had been historically. And we're going to be borrowing just in time to a greater extent so that we can mute the interest cost impact of the rate while we're in this period of where the rate is more expensive. Charles Liang : Yes, at the same time, the group ARPU had been very stable -- stably growing, so I personally do not feel cash flow will be a pressure. So, with the new loan system and systems that are here, the cash flow should not be an issue... Aaron Rakers : And it looks like your cash balance is more or less flat sequentially so I apologize for that misstatement. The real final thing for me would be, just remind us again as you kind of build out, it sounded like 2 million square feet of manufacturing capacity, how we should think about the company's current capacity situation relative to your systems business? Just remind us again, your total capacity in terms of what you can produce on a systems level? Charles Liang : Yes. As you know. We have been faster-growing company from the subsystem to completed system to completed solution and now completed rack, high-speed and kind of completed data center solution. So, we have been growing very aggressively. And that's why economical scale has been always a challenge. The good thing is in all the area I just mentioned, including total solutions and rack scale, now our economic scale has been much better than before. And situation can be only better. So that's why those capacity we prepare will be a big help for our future growth. Perry Hayes : So, Aaron, as you know prior to this additional building, which we talked about today on the call. We had a capacity in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion. And that fit nicely with the run rate that we're on. With the additional capacity, we're above that now, we're more in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our follow-up from Mehdi Hosseini. David Ryzhik : This is David again. For storage, would you be able to provide a little insight into next gen versus legacy, what the growth rates were? Perry Hayes : Yes. So, are you talking about period-over-period? David Ryzhik : Year-over-year. Perry Hayes : Year-over-year. Yes. So, as it relates to year-over-year in terms of [IBC and non-IBC.] Yes. So, I think, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So non-IBC, I think, enterprise, as Charles highlighted, was 244% and enterprise was like about 54%. David Ryzhik : Sorry, I was referring to the storage business, just within storage there's legacy and then there's next gen? Perry Hayes : I am sorry. Yes... Charles Liang : Storage, I guess, over all, is about 15%, okay? and... Perry Hayes : Yes, I'm sorry. Traditional up about 29% and next gen about 2%. David Ryzhik : Okay. Any -- are you seeing anything in the market for NexGen? For the slower growth, hyper converged All-Flash, you know anything that would account for some of the softness? Charles Liang : Yes, I guess, overall talking about next few quarters or next few years. We will continue to have a strong growth on both sides. Traditional storage and next gen. Last quarter, specifically 2% only for next gen, I guess is just a coincidence. Though overall there will be a continuous strong growth, both Traditional and next gen. David Ryzhik : And just one for Kevin, just if you can provide an update for your cash cycle efforts, any measures that you've taken already. And when we can expect improvements to the cash conversion cycle? Kevin Bauer : Yes. Naturally that's going to take some period of time, as I mentioned earlier, we worked on the collection side, being a little bit tighter in terms of not shipping until we saw customers become current, just basic blocking and tackling. On the payment side, we worked to tighten up when we pay customers and then, as I said earlier, we're being more precise about when we bring in inventories, so to the extent where maybe we brought in stock for the whole month in the beginning of the month, I am exercising the organization to be a little bit more just-in-time as it relates to when we bring in inventory. That's going to take some time to bear fruit. So, stay tuned. Charles Liang : I mean as you know we are quickly grow in enterprise and enterprise, we provide total solution. That's why the cash here cycle time is a bit longer. However, we'll continue to work with our customer for kind of better payment terms and we got a very good support from some enterprise customers basically. Perry Hayes : And we've had some suppliers help us out too with terms being a little bit longer. Charles Liang : So overall cash flow should be safe. Operator : Your next question will come from Michael Staiger with Odeon Capital. Michael Staiger : Are you guys seeing any increase in RFPs for designs that incorporate GPUs or ARM-based servers? And if so, where would you expect those segments to break out in the future on a percentage revenue basis? And would they be accretive to your current programs or would they be a replacement or a substitution of like the traditional builds that you're doing? And what will the gross margin profile look like on those as well? Perry Hayes : Big question. So, when it comes to GPU, that's included in our high-performance computing or in AI. So, we just shared that year-over-year that grew 102% so that's within our current tracking. So, you'd want to keep your eye on that. Michael Staiger : Are ARM-based servers part of your build cycle right now or... Charles Liang : We do not ARM-based. Michael Staiger : That's a no? Charles Liang : No ARM-based. Operator : Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim. And your line is open. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : I've been skipping between calls so this may have been asked before but with your -- congratulations on the debt raise. And I'm wondering what kind of number one, where their other banks that actually participated in the debt raise or did they just simply indicate interest and Bank of America is responsible for all the debt that increased that capacity that you have right now? Perry Hayes : Nehal, now I'm going to answer that question. The syndicate that we had actually was, as you pointed out was, broad. We increased a number of our relationships with a number of new banks that joined and in addition to that, I will also tell you that the commitments were oversubscribed and we had to cut back. So, it worked out very well for us. Not only did it increase the facility size but also new banking relationships for the company. Nehal Chokshi : What kind of due diligence were they able to do, do they have full access to the investigation that was done? And then the follow-up question is, I just want clarity on what does testing mean? I'm not too sure what that means. Perry Hayes : I'll answer the first half of that. And I'll let Kevin answer the second half of that question. So, with regard to the bank group, as is typical, they are under NDA kind of arrangements with us and so we could provide a bit more information to them than we could to investors who are not under an NDA. So, yes, a little bit more information was provided. Kevin Bauer : In addition to that we held weekly meetings with them where we showed our cash flow and they saw how we, as a new team, managed cash and were very impressed by that. So, I think they gained comfort over the fact that our cash flow continued to be strong and came to their conclusion. As it relates to the additional testing, I'll remind you that we're not going to be answering questions about that. But it's just the continuation of the process to get our arms around all of the issues that occurred during that timeframe. So, as we said, we believe that we think we're nearing completion there and we're working in parallel with other teams to be able to our get our filings done as expeditiously as possible and we'll leave it at that. Operator : Our next question will come from [Jon Lopez] with Vertical Group. Unidentified Analyst : I have a couple of quick ones if you guys don't mind. The first one, the data center -- the internet data center vertical, looks like it was pretty healthy. I know the disclosures have gone a little bit all over the place but it looks like it was comfortably double digits sequentially and up, as you guys said, 58% or so year-on-year. Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that and in particular are you seeing any resurgence in what used to reasonably large customer for you after they took a break for a while there? Charles Liang : All our customer continued to adopt our product and we also continued to win more new customers and the key reason I believe because our green computing, followed by resource savings. So, the green computing and resource savings solutions is not just save customers energy costs, initial hardware acquisition cost. But also, I mean [indiscernible] and also kind of help our mother earth from its pollution. So, all are positive factors. And we believe we will continue to grow strongly in those areas. Unidentified Analyst : So, it sounds like -- to rephrase what you said, but it sounds like that's a reasonably diversified kind of resurgence in that segment, is that a fair way to characterize it? Charles Liang : Yes. Again, most kinds of our multiple like Twin and the Twin Pro and BigTwin product 9 as we're including continued growth resurgence as you describe the customer coming back and then we've had a sprinkling of new customers too. Charles Liang : Indeed, a major impact, a negative impact in last few quarter is the shortage. Kind of memory shortage, SSD shortage followed by a small component shortage. So, we have been suffering a lot before and [Indiscernible] quarter for shortage and issue and the good thing, the situation is getting better. Unidentified Analyst : That actually hands up nicely to my second question, which is -- I know you guys aren't going to give us explicit guidance but just conceptually, given that we're seeing a little of leveling off and some easing in memory, which is reasonably large for you as bill materials and I understand some of the problems in other places like capacitors and things like that but those I think are reasonably small, certainly relative to memory. So, I guess the thrust of my question is, as the year progresses, is it reasonable for us to see the gross margin lift from this kind of flattish range you've been in from the last three or four quarters or are the headwinds in those other buckets enough to prevent that? Charles Liang : In terms of shortage and the component pricing, I believe looking forward, next few quarter will be in the positive side. Perry Hayes : I think, it will be positive but modestly, I think, or I expect, that we'll operating in this gross margin range for now, not anything appreciably large but certainly now that I've been on the top for roughly about 90 days and after we get job 1 done in terms of getting our SEC filings done, we'll be able to devote more attention to developing programs internally to improve gross margin over time. And in over time, we'll look forward to sharing progress with you in that regard. Unidentified Analyst : Two more really quick one, I apologize. If I look at the OpEx it's kind of implied in where things are shaking out, it looks like OpEx has been pretty flattish non-GAAP at about 68, 69, in that ballpark for the last couple of quarters. Is that an area you would expect to hold, in this same range or do you think as some of the facility spending and whatnot layers in that we'd expect OpEx to maybe pick up a little bit? Perry Hayes : Well, facility spending is mostly going to be in the manufacturing arena so it will be hitting gross profit as we turn it on. But it will be at a modest pace. In terms of OpEx we're continuing to invest and hire to scale so it will have some modest up-drift as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : And the very last one. Just coming back to the cash really quick. I just want to understand the dynamics. Your gross cash as was noted, was up like $1 million but you drew like an extra incremental $9 million off the facilities, roughly. My question is, was that timing related to an extent? As you're getting rid of the old facility and bringing the new facility on? Or if not, kind of what drove that draw in the revolver? Perry Hayes : That was just needed to -- for working capital and specifically to buy inventory. Recognize that we closed the new facility in April, which is after March, so there's no history there. That's why I wanted to preview for you that as compared to our current cash balances, don't be surprised in June that our cash balances are going to come down because of the fact that we're going to be much more prudent in terms of borrowing, and managing closer. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. We should see [indiscernible] down, in other words, in June? Perry Hayes : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And it appears at this time we have no further questions, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang, for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and we'll be looking forward to finish fiscal year 2018 on a strong note. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Supermicro Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. Perry Hayes : Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, which ended June 30, 2018. During today's conference call, Super Micro will address the current state of the company's efforts to file its delinquent SEC filings, the business and market trends from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, and the company's estimated financial results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2018. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of two news releases from the company that were distributed at the close of regular trading and are available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session, in which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Bauer, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon. Today is the first trading day because our very good quarterly results are overshadowed by the news of our filing status. We remain undeterred in our efforts to complete our financial reports. We have worked diligently and deployed significant resources towards completing the 2017 and 2018 financial statements, but are not able to file by the deadline of August 24, 2018. This was the deadline given to us by the NASDAQ Appeal Panel when they granted the company an exception to the listing standards requiring timely filing of SEC reports. We've made tremendous progress on this matter, having completed the analysis of specific revenue transactions identified through our audit committee's investigation. To date, our cash flows have not been impacted by our findings and no transaction reviewed by the company as part of this process has involved revenue that could not ultimately be recognized, nor have we concluded that a restatement to financial result is necessary. The question you must be asking is, why is this matter taking so long? The answer is that in order to be thorough, we're reviewing transactions near the end of each quarter for similar issues, found in the earlier testing. But particularly, as it relates to the matching of purchase order and shipping terms to the timing of revenue. As we're a high volume business, this entails locating documentation that is on-site, archive or at third-parties and reviewing thousands of revenue transactions in detail using the structured approach. There are a number of issues, however, let me share an example of an issue that has arisen in our reviews. We have from time-to-time offered free shipping to customers even though terms of our agreements with those customers, provided that the customer would arrange for its own shipping company to pick the products up at our factory shipping dock. This package had the unintended accounting consequence of converting the transaction from an ex-works transaction to an FOB transaction. If end of the quarter shipments are adjusted in this way, it can cause the appropriate date for recognizing the revenue for their shipments to slip from one quarter into the next. This is one example of what we are looking for as we review thousands of transactions. The company believes the revenue recognized for review transactions is valid revenue. The main issue is the quarter in which revenue must be recognized. We have not yet determined whether the magnitude of any timing adjustment will be material to any of our previously filed financial statements. We continue to work diligently to complete the review, assess the impact, and complete our financial statements and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We've engaged KPMG to assist us with our review, and we are also working closely with our independent auditor to complete the job. We appreciate the efforts of both KPMG and Deloitte. Finally, we are also working closely with the agent of our bank group to inform on the testing process as well as our progress toward completing all the SEC filings. As a result, we expect to continue to have adequate lines of credit to fund the continued growth of the company. We're not able today to project the date by which we will complete this review and file all our delinquent SEC reports, but we believe that date is not too far in the future. Thankfully, however, our business remains healthy and has grown during this time, as a result of our fourth quarter reflect. Turning to a brief overview of our financial performance during the fourth quarter of 2018, Super Micro had strong fourth quarter revenue and net profit. We estimate fourth quarter revenue was in the range of $986 million to $996 million. It was approximately 39% higher year-over-year. With this strong quarterly revenue, we achieved a fiscal year revenue of approximately 3.3 billion. We estimate fourth quarter non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share within the range of $0.75 to $0.79. We grew revenue in all market verticals with key markets growing significantly year-over-year. Global 2000 more than tripled year-over-year. Internet data center more than quintupled year-over-year and non-Internet data center grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Accelerated computing was up over 90%, embedded grew 20%, storage and channel were up 9% and 3% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the US enjoyed the highest growth of 48%, followed by EMEA that grew 28% and Asia-Pac that was up 24%. Other regions grew 56%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 12.8% to 13%. Our customer mix primarily affected margin this quarter. We estimate non-GAAP EPS range this quarter was $0.75 to $0.79, which was a record high and almost double year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, we estimate cash generated from operations was $38 million. After deducting CapEx of $8 million, we estimate free cash flow of $30 million for the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we mentioned our effort to manage our working capital. This quarter, we reduced our cash conversion cycle to 82 days from 99 days in the prior quarter.  We achieved improvements in days sales outstanding due to collections and improved shipment linearity and reduced inventory days by being more precisely timing purchases, that was offset by reducing days payable. All in all, our business is strong and we improved performance by working diligently, concurrent on filing our financial reports. Let me now turn it over to Charles for his comments. Charles Liang : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite our substantial efforts and progress to complete our SEC filings, I'm very disappointed that we denominated a filing payment. Personally, I cannot convey how much pain I feel in this unfortunate development. This, however, has not affected my confidence in Super Micro's strong foundation. In the meantime, we are achieving record high revenue and profit, and continue to introduce new unparalleled product innovation. We are committed to completing our SEC filing as soon as possible and making sure this problem will never happen again. Completion of the audit is our first big step. We have been investing to further improve our people, skill, process and to meet the highest financial standard and to meet the need of rapidly growing USA-based global technology companies. We need to make sure our infrastructure has a strong asset that accelerates our growth and deliver flawless customer experience. A change is being made and already improve our business operations. We add new management across the business and financial operations of the company. [indiscernible] and experience in large scale operations. We also add a new Chief Compliant Officer and a new Vice President of Internal Audit, and strengthened our revenue recognition team. [indiscernible] 31% in the last year, despite the disruption caused by the continued delay to our 10-K filing. Today, Super Micro's business and product technology leadership has never been stronger. Our fourth quarter revenue will be in the range of 986 million to 996 million, approximately 13% higher year-over-year, and was a new record high. With this strong quarterly revenue, Super Micro surpassed 3.3 billion for fiscal 2018. Record revenue and profit are strong indicators of our continued success of our product and market focus. We continue to expand our technology leadership with new products that deliver game-changing performance. [indiscernible] and Big Data applications. For AI machine learning, we have partnered with NVIDIA to view the most powerful platform. That combines 16 Tesla V100 GPUs and 2 PetaFLOPS SuperServer, partnered with NVIDIA in the same store. We delivered a new class of high data throughput that is [indiscernible]. That can deliver up to a petabyte of high-performance All-Flash NVMe storage in the compact 1U system and can deliver up to 18 million IOPS. I am more confident of our abilities and technical opportunities than at any time in our 25-year history. We are clearly focused on meeting our obligation for SEC reporting and operating low cost business. We have many great things going on at the Super Micro, as we continue to bring to market our new innovation. The resource facing technologies are enabling great opportunities for us, especially for the upcoming 5G transition, enterprise Global 2000, and AI machine learning. I am looking forward to sharing more of these exciting opportunities, which will be in future quarters. And now, I will hand over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session with sell-side analysts, who will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the audit committee investigations or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you and really phenomenal results. But Kevin, as you know, the stock is reacting to delayed filing and really great color on some of the examples that's going on. You made a statement at the end that you believe that the ability to file these filings is not too far away, but in the second press release today, it does say that there is still significant work to do. So, can you help bridge the delta between the verbal comment and what's in the filing -- and what's in the 8-K? Kevin Bauer : Yeah. So, I think it is true that we still have a substantial amount of work to do. I think what we've said in terms of being able to see it in the future is that, now that we are later in the process, we actually have pretty good visibility on what it takes to remain to be able to complete the process. So that's how I would string them together is that it's one of better visibility, but there's still a fair amount to do. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So, the process that was defined on what needs to be done to review a transaction was established relatively late, relative to when the investigation started about a year ago. Is that fair to say? Kevin Bauer : Well, certainly as the results of the investigation came in, we were able to see a little bit more in terms of the processes that we were need to do, so certainly it was evolving. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And just to be clear, you said, significant transactions left for review, but you've already reviewed hundreds of transactions. So, are you only a fraction of the way through, are you like 10% to 20% the way through or are you more like 80%, 90% of way through, what needs to be reviewed? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We really can't go into that level of detail. What I can share with you is that we've taken the approach of largest transactions and are now going towards smaller transactions. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Understood. So onto the fundamental stuff, at the midpoint for the June quarter, you had 25% Q-over-Q growth, and that's about 1,000 basis points above your typical seasonality. And you did see gross margin tick down at that Q-over-Q, so can you parse that between potential drivers of mix, component, input costs, competitive pricing, and then an upside lever that all these three should be also offsetting -- should have been volume as well. So maybe you can also comment on how much of a positive factor volume would have been, if the other three items were held constant? Kevin Bauer : That's a lot. So, I\u2019ll tell you that, we are certainly aware of the fact that the industry is growing. We are benefiting from that. We are happy with the significant enterprise wins that we are getting. I will share with you that as I looked at the margin mix, a lot of it had to do with just the quarter-over-quarter mix in terms of some of our customers. So some of that is related to the products that they buy, others are related to the aggressiveness sometimes that we have on larger deals. So I think that's -- those were the two primary factors. Nehal Chokshi : Would you say that the pricing environment has become more competitive relative to a quarter ago? Kevin Bauer : I wouldn't say that universally, no. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Jake Wilhelm : Hi. This is Jake Wilhelm on behalf of Aaron Rakers. Congrats on the strong results. I was wondering if you could give me some color on what you're seeing with AMD's traction, with their [indiscernible]. Charles Liang : Yes. You can see the AMD products have been getting popular, and we ship kind of much more products than last quarter. So the change should be continued. Jake Wilhelm : Thank you. I was also wondering if you could give me some color on Intel's Optane product and the traction you're seeing around that with Intel's 10-nanometer challenges? Charles Liang : Yeah. We continue to ship Intel Optane technology. Again [indiscernible] people want a lower latency, kind of higher bandwidth and Optane technology provides excellent solution in that area. And we have a great product line, we\u2019re the earliest player in the market. As to 10-nanometer technology from Intel, as of this moment, we tried to observe and overall we feel very optimistic still. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Let\u2019s take a follow-up from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : All right. Thanks. So your midpoint guidance is down 15% Q-over-Q, which is 1,000 or 1,500 basis points more than what I'd consider seasonal. So can you give some color as far as what's below seasonal guidance? Obviously, you did have some incredible Q-over-Q growth over the past two quarters, but just wanted to make sure there's nothing more to it than that? Kevin Bauer : No. I think, our primary view of this quarter is really seasonal, I don't think there is anything unusual as it relates to the guidance. Hopefully, we'll do well. Charles Liang : Now, with our guidance, 810 million to 870 million, and that would be -- this quarter, September quarter, will be still a strong quarter basically. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And non-GAAP OpEx plans for September quarter. Can you give any color there? Kevin Bauer : Yeah. We're not giving any guidance other than revenue at the moment. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. All right. And are you going to be able to provide some color on system volume, system ASP, node volume, and node ASP for the June quarter? Kevin Bauer : No. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : Hi. Thanks. I'm wondering if you can just spend a moment, because it's not really that apparent to me by the wording that you offered in the release, specifically you referenced in the second press release, the review of hundreds of transactions and then in the same sentence, the conclusion that you don't believe a restatement is necessary. So I guess what I'm hoping you can expand upon a little bit is, what exactly have you found as you've gone through these hundreds of transactions and what are the points of focus and what in that work has led you to conclude that a restatement is not necessary? And then, last part of that, what would make you conclude prospectively that one might be necessary. Kevin Bauer : So the predominant pattern that we're seeing is that there are ins and outs across the quarters. And so, so far, they've kind of netted each other out to a great degree and that's really what the primary modus operandi is. Jon Lopez : Okay. And could you just speak a little bit more to the progression of that analysis over the period that you've referenced, i.e., fiscal '15 through '17? I mean, is it fairly uniform across these periods or do you see more congestion in one period versus another? Kevin Bauer : Yes, I really can't speak to that, but by virtue of the fact that there's not been significant distortions, it doesn't say that there's a big difference in the pattern. Jon Lopez : Okay. Understood. The second clarification I was hoping you could offer is -- you don't reference fiscal '18 at all. And I understand that\u2019s not a period that you've provided SEC filings, but are you reviewing transactions for FY18 as part of this as well or has FY18 been for lack of a better term immunized just based on some of the focus and activities that went into motion when you discovered this issue? Kevin Bauer : Well, I can share with you that as we've gone through the year and things have come to like the investigation, we have had our eye on that as it relates to how we have estimated the quarters over \u201818. So we have incorporated some of that. We still will have to go through the transactions at the end, but we've been improving as you go so to speak. Jon Lopez : Understood. The next question I have was just your commentary around the credit lines. My recollection and it\u2019s a little foggy, my recollection is that there was some contingencies tied to the filing of the SEC documents. Can you just revisit that topic quickly? Are there procedures or do you have to go through separate processes on the credit side now that this deadline won't be met? And then what would be the timeframe over which those would be transitioned to outcomes? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So the credit line, the way that it was structured is that it was a one-year term. If you remember, we closed this in April. So, therefore, it had one-year term or completion of our delinquent filings. And then upon the earlier of one of those dates, we would be able to convert it into phase II, that phase II actually allowed for an expanded credit facility, so that's the nature of it. Charles Liang : [indiscernible] Kevin Bauer : That's right. Jon Lopez : No. That's right, but that could change. I mean, your access to credit could change I suppose as driving that. And it sounds like what you're saying is that you still have some amount of duration on that one-year term? Kevin Bauer : That's correct. Jon Lopez : Okay. Sorry, could you just remind like approximately when does that duration end? Kevin Bauer : It's like the third week of April, I believe. Charles Liang : 2019. Kevin Bauer : Yeah. 2019. Jon Lopez : Okay. Understood. And so, at that point, for whatever reason the situation is unresolved, then there would be a separate process you'd have to undertake from that perspective? Kevin Bauer : Yeah. We're getting a little ahead of ourselves. Jon Lopez : Sorry, just a couple of questions on the business, real quick if you wouldn't mind. Can you guys just offer a rough split between what your service systems business did in June relative to the accessories portion of the business, compared to subsystems, excuse me? Kevin Bauer : Yeah. So our systems business was roughly about 84% in the last quarter. Jon Lopez : Okay, 84%. And would you expect a material change in the segment splits looking into September? Charles Liang : The systems business is still continuing to grow stronger. Jon Lopez : I'm sorry, the systems business will continue to outgrow the subsystems business? Kevin Bauer : You're talking amongst verticals? Jon Lopez : No. I was really just looking at the split between the two reportable segments, you have the service system segment in every subsystems business, the other 16%, I'm just asking as we go into from June to September, are you anticipating any kind of sizable shift between those revenue buckets? Kevin Bauer : No. It's been a slow increase towards systems, and it would continue to have that kind of movement. Jon Lopez : Okay. Understood. And sorry the last question on the gross margin side. I think I heard what you said earlier, I guess, I'm just looking for a little bit more on trajectory. I mean, you've obviously seen some portions of the component bill of material become a little bit more favorable. Your gross margin obviously went the other way. It sounds like that was vertically related. I'm assuming that was hyperscale to an extent. But as we just think about the next several quarters to the extent that bill of materials buckets continue to trend favorably, is there a reason that you wouldn't expect your gross margins to begin to trend back up toward the mid 13's, low 14's. I mean I'm not asking you to quantify that range, I'm just saying directionally would you expect improvement as the cost side continues to be a bit more favorable. Kevin Bauer : Modest improvement overtime. Operator : And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you everyone for joining us and see you very soon. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session with sell-side analysts. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first of all comment briefly on our first quarter performance. Our first quarter revenue was in the range of $952 million to $962 million, which compared to our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 20% increase year-over-year. Our momentum in market vertical continues with strong growth, especially in Global 2000, Storage and AI machine learning. Computer system revenue was consistent with last quarter at approximately 34% of revenue and up 56% year-over-year. Our total ASP growth continues with higher add value sale of our industry-leading technology innovation and more high-end computer systems. Kevin will provide a more detail on our financial results. The focus of our strategy in the past few years had been our Global 2000 business, which grew 132% year-over-year. Now resource-saving architecture had been the key message of that focus, leveraging our breakthrough product and further to mark advantage to deliver significant saving to customers. We've achieved greater success story with company like NASA, Intel and many other industry leaders. The resource-saving architecture reduced TCE, total cost to the environment, which brings significant TCO saving along with environmental benefits. The resource-saving chip operate \u2013 that might operate this aggregated design enables the independent upgrade of system components, by navigating and replacing the entire hardware system realizing the customer can save up to 60% in system deflation cost and reduce IT waste up to 50%. Now resource saving between [indiscernible] could only optimize power-saving design, basically, air cooling including sheer power, and cooling could deliver power with improvement in power efficiency over traditional servers. Now on top NVMe match inside support together with the resource saving feature mixed between one of the highest volume server platform in the industry today. Without stable 1U Petascale all-flash NVMe system, that when combined with high-performance fabric and open rack scale management software can be used to dynamically provision critical assets, such all-flash NVMe, GPUs and [indiscernible] saving cost and reducing e-waste. We have a broadest portfolio of all-flash NVMe system with more than 150 system model available, making Supermicro the benchmark leader in storage. With that, Storage was again one of our strongest segments that drives revenue across multiple verticals including Global 2000 and next-generation storage. This advanced storage solution provide a real time-to-value competitive advantage for users with data-intensive workload like a Big Data, autonomous driving, AI, and HPC application against traditional SSD. We recently launched all-flash 32 hot-swappable EDSFF driver in the high-density 1U system designed to deal the way for NVMe technology partially we team there. This means that we should approve full petabyte of high-performance all-flash storage in 1U with an outstanding 30 million IOPS and 52 petabyte per second throughput. Samsung has also partnered with us to develop 1U NF1 storage server featuring the most power-efficient high-bandwidth loaded density next-generation flash technology, which is the highest storage density and gives higher performance currently available on the market. Deeper learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence that we should grow very well and was up 26% from last year. At a supercomputing conference in Dallas, Texas, this week, we showcased our cloud server based on the NVIDIA HGX-2 platform. The SuperServer 9029GP combined 16 Tesla V100 32-gigabyte SXM3 GPU, connect via NVLink and NVSwitch to work as a unified to pent up accelerator with half of terabyte of aggregate memory to deliver unmatched computing power. Moreover, our new SuperServer 6049GP is optimized for the modern AI inference. This 4U system achieves maximum GPU density and performance with the support for up to 20 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs with Turing Tensor Core technology. Now let me move to other business highlights. This September, Super Micro celebrated our 25th anniversary. The Company was founded in San Jose, California in 1993, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Over last 25 years, we have grown from a Silicon Valley start to a Fortune 1000 company global leader. As we have grown, we had built our space within the city of San Jose by investing hundreds of million of dollars in local infrastructure and people and had become one of the San Jose's largest employer. We own more than 1.5 million square feet state-of-the-art facility for producing best quality product and improving production efficiency. We have also recently broken ground on a new business partner, that we are continuing extending our design, manufacturing and business across the valley. More than 70% of our engineers and employees are based in Silicon Valley and we assemble and integrate more than 60% of our servers and storage systems in the U.S. much higher percentage than any of our largest competitor. Finally, I would also like to comment on a legendary new story. We're feeling confident that recent allegation from a single publication about malicious chip supposedly being imprint on our hardware during manufacturing are not only impossible but also wrong. Over the years, we had produced millions of motherboard, 1.3 million last year alone, yet we have never been contacted by any customer with regard to a malicious chip.  Also we have never been contacted by any U.S. or foreign law enforcement or intelligence agency alerting us of malicious chip on our hardware or of any such investigation. We continue to work with our customers to address any security concerns and to ensure the quality and integrity of our products. In summary, we are still on a fast pace of growing U.S.-based manufacturer of server and storage. Our first quarter growth of 40% year-over-year is a great start to fiscal year 2019. Expanding and deepening our customer base, we saw this was significant in offering the best of quality products for trusted solution. We'll drive our continuous success. Also, I want to thank our entire Super Micro team for staying focused on our goal. Many tech companies have been talking about digital transformation across the enterprise. Super Micro is building it every day. It has been great 25 years for Super Micro, and I am looking forward to continue our journey to bigger success. And now, I will hand it over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Perry. Thank you, Charles. Today, we issued a press release announcing our solid financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We also filed a current report on Form 8-K disclosing the Company's decision to restate certain prior financial statements.  First, I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019, and I will then make a few comments about the decision to restate those prior financial statements. Super Micro had a strong first quarter of revenue in net profit.  As Charles mentioned, we estimate first quarter revenue within the range of $952 million to $962 million. It was approximately 40% higher year-over-year and above our guidance range of $810 million to $870 million. We grew revenue in all market verticals with key markets growing significantly year-over-year. Global 2000 grew approximately 130% year-over-year. Internet data center grew approximately 150%. While non-Internet data center grew approximately 95% year-over-year. Accelerated computing was up 26% and Embedded grew approximately 30%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. enjoyed the highest growth at nearly 45% followed by EMEA that grew nearly 50% and Asia Pac that was up approximately 30%. Other regions grew approximately 15%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 13.2% to 13.4%. Our customer mix contributed to the rebound in margin this quarter. Compensation costs increased across the board in both manufacturing and operating expense this quarter related to annual merit increases as well as performance bonuses or profit-sharing payments to non-executives. We also celebrated our 25th anniversary in grand fashion. We estimate non-GAAP EPS range this quarter was from $0.66 to $0.70, more than double year-over-year. For the first quarter, we estimate cash generated from operations was $50 million. After deducting CapEx of $4 million, we estimate free cash flow of $46 million for the first quarter. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased seasonally to 92 days from 82 days in the prior quarter. Both day sales outstanding due to collections and inventory days increased to position stock for the second quarter was offset by increasing days payable. Our near-term target is to stay in the range of 85 to 90 days for the cash conversion cycle. Now let's turn to the progress we are making on the fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. The company has substantially completed its testing and assessments. The day we announced that we are determined to restate prior period financials and provide an estimated adjusted amounts. We are in the final stages of preparation and conclusion, so that we will continue to work with our auditors to complete our 2017 Form 10-K. The core basis of the restatements remains timing of revenue recognition. Based on our assessments to date, the company confirms that although in our restated financials, some revenue recognized in prior periods will be recognized in the subsequent period. All revenues and customer transactions in the period subject to the restatement is valid revenue. During our review of prior periods, we also discovered additional errors relating to the classification of certain inventory. The number and breadth of the adjustment, coupled with their aggregate magnitude, was significantly enough for us to conclude that restating prior periods was necessary. Today, we believe total cash flows from operating, investing and financing have not been impacted with the exception of certain balance sheet classification errors that have been determined to have an inventory effect on cash and cash flow from operations. Based on our findings, we expect to material weaknesses over financial reporting. We have, depending on the matter, begun remediation measures to varying degrees. Along the way, we have developed stronger revenue policies, trained employees and developed new standards. There are number of remediation efforts. Let me share a few examples. We have hired senior revenue talent and grown our revenue team, implemented strong cutoff controls, including walking and shipping dock at the close of the quarter and enhancing our revenue testing. And we've revamped the sales sub-certification process at quarter-end. In addition, we have formed a new internal audit team that is conducting testing on the second half of 2018 and absorbing the transfer of knowledge from the efforts of our advisers in the process. Our efforts on completing the filings for fiscal year 2018 have been running in parallel and are well underway. We are working diligently to complete this testing and the rolling of the account conclusions from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. This should enable us to have the fiscal year 2018 financials and updated assessment on internal controls of our financial reporting ready for audit, largely in parallel. Lastly, we are guiding net sales for the second quarter in the range of $830 million to $890 million. We note there is much anticipation around slowed IT infrastructure spending, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly. Also we experienced a pause in October from some customers following the unwanted hardware hacking article. However, we've begun to see those customers returning, but we will not understand the full impact until after the quarter ends. Order to date, compared to last year, we are materially ahead on a billings and open order basis. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask question. I would like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the Audit Committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Go ahead, sir. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks and congrats on an amazing quarter. 41% year-over-year growth on top of 26% year-over-year growth with prior quarter, that's massive, and 15% revenue itself. Congratulations, especially in the face of that Bloomberg Businessweek article. Could you provide some \u2013 what was the year-over-year growth for the components in revenue and the percent mix between those two? I'm sorry, between components and systems? Perry Hayes : Yes, just one second. Nehal, this is Perry. The systems was 84% of total revenue. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And how we should grow year-over-year? Perry Hayes : That was consistent with the last quarter. I think probably we need to look that one up and get back to you later. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, all right. And then Kevin, you talked about that the guidance reflects a slowing down IT environment as well as potential impact from the Bloomberg Businessweek article. So there is no potential there having been demand called in from the December to September quarter? That's also part of that weekend guidance or it's completely the first two items that you talked about? Kevin Bauer : Well, I mean, I think there is also possible speculation that customers could have potentially ordered early to try and beat tariffs. We don't have a specific evidence of that but that could be possible. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take a follow-up question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Thank you. Nehal Chokshi : Thanks. All right, so the $50 million cash from operations, that's very impressive. And you mentioned that there was a 10-day increase in the cash conversion cycle, which is indeed seasonal. But I would expect that there would have been a significant consumption of cash then. And so what was the balance sheet item that did actually enable the generation of cash? Kevin Bauer : Yes, we're not disclosing too much more. I think, one thing that has helped and I\u2019ve mentioned this before is that our shipment linearity is much better now, so we are shipping more early in the quarter and have that opportunity to kind of collect that. So I think that's a good portion of that. Nehal Chokshi : Got it, okay. And then finally, with respect to the 8-K that was filed that shows the ranges of likely restatement. It looks like to me there's about a net $60 million of revenue that's shifting out from those periods of fiscal year 2015 or fiscal year 2017 into fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Is that a correct characterization, I do recognize that's really only 1% of cumulative revenues, but just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly? Kevin Bauer : So as of late, if you're trying to understand what the impact there will be on fiscal year 2018. That will be limited to table that's shown in fiscal year 2017. And then if you recall that I mentioned that we would be continuing to apply the same procedures as fiscal year 2018, so there will be a continued roll effect. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then finally, if I look at the net income, that's been shifted out. That's $10 million. So if you take that $10 million divide that by $16 million, that's about \u2013 13% net income ratio? That's much higher than what your corporate average was during those periods. So what's the explanation for that? It seems like the revenue that's been shifted out tends to the higher net income margin. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So I think there is other elements in that reduction of income. If you remember, we said that the primary effects are related to sales as well as inventory. So to the extent that there are inventory debits, those won\u2019t move into fiscal 2018. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, all right. Thank you. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Kevin Bauer : Nehal, the system revenues last year in the same quarter was 75%. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next we\u2019ll go to Hosseini with Susquehanna. David Ryzhik : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. David Ryzhik here for Mehdi Hosseini. Would love to dive in a little more in storage, can you remind us what you said around NexGen Storage, what the growth rate was and some of the trends you're seeing there? And I had a follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes, we see people really moving in NVMe [indiscernible]. David Ryzhik : Great. What was the growth rate again? Kevin Bauer : I\u2019m looking at my notes. I see didn't share that. It's over 50%. David Ryzhik : Storage as a whole or NexGen Storage? Kevin Bauer : That\u2019s storage as a whole. David Ryzhik : Understood. And would love to get your thoughts on the memory components and impact to margins. It seems like things are obviously easing. It was a headwind before. Just how are you guys thinking about the impact of DRAM and NAND flash pricing moving forward and the impact to your business? Charles Liang : Yes, very good question. We expect both SSD and NVMe pricing continuing to be lower and so as DRAM, pricing to become softer and softer in the next few quarters. So from this point of view, we believe all our profit \u2013 I mean profit margin will be keeping as same as before or slightly better. However, the revenue maybe slightly lower because of that cost for memory and flash are lower. But basically there are good signs to us, basically. David Ryzhik : Okay, great. And then just for the outlook for the December quarter. What specifically have you heard? Is it just like broader macro or is it specifically based on just some customer conversations that you have had that has resulted in the lower outlook? Charles Liang : I would have to say it is micro business. IT industry just like I mentioned slowed a little bit over. David Ryzhik : And just lastly, I \u2013 one of your customers in IDC for a while had announced a big acquisition in the cloud space. Just wondering if that, if you view that as an opportunity for Super Micro going forward? Just any thoughts on how that shapes up for you? Charles Liang : Yes, I mean, for change, basically, we see how it is positive to our business. David Ryzhik : Thank you so much. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : And next question from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : Hi, good evening. Can you hear me okay? Charles Liang : Yes. Jon Lopez : Okay, great. Thanks. I'm wondering, you made a comment in the prepared remarks relative to \u2013 it was some reference of the orders or perhaps billings measured year-on-year that you were tracking comfortably ahead. If you remind me just flushing that out a little bit. Just what do refer and just may be some level of magnitude, just given ballpark on a year-on-year basis? Kevin Bauer : Yes. What we were trying to share was that if memory serves me, we did roughly about $851 million in the quarter a year ago. And our guidance is slightly above that range. What we were trying to differentiate here was that given that were macro considerations as Charles mentioned as well as we've had the Bloomberg impact. The other key thing that we wanted to share is that, even though our guidance range is still within that metric as compared to last year, our quarter-to-date progress is ahead of that. And we think that it is healthy ahead, but we're not going to give our specific metric. Jon Lopez : Okay, understood. I apologize. Is trying to communicate the business is sort of running better than what the year-on-year guidance implies and you're losing yourselves to account for macro considerations, et cetera? Kevin Bauer : We are saying that we have better identification than last year as it relates to getting to $850 million or $860 million or whatever within our range. Jon Lopez : Okay, understood. Second question, could you just possibly flush out a little bit the comment you made around the article? May be specifically, just may be offer a bit of a cadence like, I'm assuming that there was sort of all hand on that scramble period directly after the article, but if could you walk us how the interaction has been? And just any anecdotes or offer a little bit more detail on the idea of customers perhaps starting to migrate back, is that sort of appear to have been largely a non-issue? Can you maybe just spend a second on that? Thanks. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So we are not going to get ahead of ourselves in that. I think we've had communications directly with customers and the way that we feel about the business is in relation to those discussions with customers. Charles Liang : From our couple of estimate, we don't believe it happened to our hardware. So basically, we don't believe there is chip. Jon Lopez : Understood. I guess what I'm just trying to get a little bit sense for is was there a period like a complete freeze up around sort of customer dialogue and then bought out pretty fast or was there not that? I guess, I was trying to get a characterization here that was two months out, if you guys sort of have a feel that the crux of the problem has largely moved passed you. I understand that there is some uncertainty left, but I'm just trying to get a sense of progress, between point A and point B? Charles Liang : I would have to say, I mean, we don't believe their balance sheet and most of our key customers don't believe that too. So at this moment, we feel pretty comfortable for our future business. Jon Lopez : Okay, understood. Last question, I apologize. On the December guide, can you just offer some qualitative commentary around that cloud vertical? It\u2019s obviously been very strong for a couple of quarters. And I'm just wondering, are you guys factoring in some easing whether that\u2019s project related or potentially pull forward related? Or just any characterization as to what that specific segment is doing as you go from calendar Q3 to calendar Q4? Kevin Bauer : Yes, we don't provide forward guidance by market vertical. Jon Lopez : Understood. Is it too much to ask just to say whether it would be up, down or flat? Kevin Bauer : I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. Jon Lopez : I'm just trying to get a sense\u2026 Kevin Bauer : Basically, we believe with our macro ITP may slow down relative, basically from a lot of our vendors, our competitors and industry analysis result. Jon Lopez : Okay, thanks. Just so it's clear what I'm trying to get. That business tends to be a little bit more lumpy and project related and sometimes travel independent macro. It's been very strong for a couple of quarters. So I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you had some temporary pause in some activity that may be contributing to what you're seeing in December? Kevin Bauer : Assign it to macro. Jon Lopez : Thank you very much for all the thoughts. Really appreciate it. Kevin Bauer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, it appears we have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you, everyone, for today. And have a great day. See you next quarter.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first of call comment briefly on our second quarter performance. Our second quarter revenue will be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, which surpass our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 9% year-over-year growth. It is our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our growth momentum in three market segments continue with gain in Global 2000 Enterprise, Storage and desperately the Computing. Computer system revenue was approximately 82% of total revenue, up 16% year-over-year, driven by higher ASP growth continued. We\u2019re pleased to the growth \u2013 continue the growth of our business this quarter both in the Data Center and the age despite a macroeconomic challenges. Super Micro is rare producing to drive continue on the revenue growth and win market share as we did this fiscal quarter. Our fiscal year today total revenue approximately 23% ahead of last year, in line with our traditional growth trend. Our Global 2000 business continued to show strong performance with 16% growth year-over-year. Our Global 2000 business utilized a entire Super Micro Computer encompass in compute, storage, accelerating the computing, networking, managing this ROI and service. Last quarter, our achievable rate, which is grew significantly and how our Twin Family grew 28% year-over-year, substantially supported by our midstream products. We\u2019re consistently trends in our management ROI and service opening to provide additional value and revenue based through our customer total life cycle. I would like to remains top quality, our resource saving system, which is ability to deliver superior total cost of ownership TCO along with the use environmental impact will have significant interest with the private companies. We continue to invest in our resource saving solution improving this aggregate system and research and development on Pentium lifecycle in closures past type and ROI subsystem. This technology we have our customers stays on both hardware and on the cost, where reduce IT with which lower our total cost improve environment TCE in their data. Storage grew 24% over last year, comprising approximately 26% of total revenue. Our Petascale remain of full-fledged NVMe only storage service delivered a industry-best performance in latency, higher and bandwidth according to next generation based technology such as U.2, Samsung NF1, Intel Ruler and EDSFF, form factor SSD. Super Micro enables the software defined storage market with optimized high performance storage systems, unlike other competitors who offer higher cost with proprietary over hedge. We are excited to see many industry leaders adopted this new over hedge technology offering a real time to value advantage to their next generation roadmap. In machine learning and artificial intelligence, we see a strong growth accelerated computing applications, continue to grow, and making new possibility in both the marketing detail and scientific verticals. We also manage additional optimized market for GPU system in numerous phone tech designed to accelerated data center capability and cloud computing and [indiscernible]. Super Micro\u2019s new NVIDIA HGX-2 with SuperSever supporting NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with over 80,000 core delivering a niche performance of up to 2PetaFlop for AI and machine learning. Looking ahead to new engineering developments and growth opportunities. Last quarter, we begin seeding the upcoming future generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors to key customers, that we begin later in the quarter. We launched 30 programs for those new Scalable processor along with Octane PC for system memory. We have received very positive initial reaction from customer field and we anticipate the upcoming server replace cycle, we are prepared for the revenue growth for Super Micro in the upcoming quarter. As the market moves to 5G, Super Micro is uniquely positioned to address solution from [indiscernible] to the cloud. We expanded our selection of compact IoT service solution to address a wider range of verticals including networking, communications, security and industry automation operates with wide new module, network edge prefer, of course up to 36 network calls, and it is used for network function virtualization and totally defined networking SDA. There\u2019s a put on market below CPU cut and market below LPGN within AI and accelerated computing to 5G. In summary, we achieved an important milestone this year, delivering 10% order wise in systems according to industry reporting. We will continue to gain next year with our resource-saving acknowledge to save cost of hardware producing cost, while improving their overall TCO and TCE. With our U.S. headquarters and the manufacturing and global scale, we are uniquely position to gain optimized design and competitive \u2013 our faster growing and large system verticals such as cloud, AI and 5G. We are also focusing on hardware technology decision for both compute, the new second generation Intel Scalable processor and storage including NF1, Ruler and EDSFF. [indiscernible] large scale design win. This momentum will prepare Super Micro to power growth of it\u2019s large scale in 2019. And now, I will hand the section over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filing. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal second quarter revenue within the range of $915 million to $925 million. With that results, we have exceeded our revenue guidance range over my tenure for the past three quarters. Our customers continue to grow their business with us and drive digital transformation using Super Micro\u2019s cloud and edge portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, you may enjoy the highest growth approximately 28% followed by the U.S., which grew approximately 11% offset by a decline in Asia-Pac of approximately 11%. Other regions grew approximately 23%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 13.9% to 14.1%. Our margin benefited from improved customer mix, partially due to lower sales to Asia and lower provision for excess and obsolete inventory. Operating expenses were higher this quarter related to product development materials, employee bonuses, audit fee and a provision for a bad debt. We estimate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share this quarter within the range of $0.57 to $0.61. We continue to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $42 million. After deducting CapEx of $4 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $38 million for the quarter. On a cumulative basis over the last three quarters, we estimate free cash flow was approximately $114 million. That has allowed us to pay down our loan, and reach positive cash position. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased to 96 days from 92 days in their prior quarter. Day sales outstanding decreased slightly, while inventory days increased. Our near term target remain from 85 to 90 days. We are guiding net sales for the third quarter in the range of $800 million to $860 million. We are announcing normal business trends in every fields from sizable business renewals that existing customer. We believe we are back to business as usual. Now let\u2019s turn into progress we are making on our fiscal 2017 10-K. If you recall, we concluded last quarter that restating prior periods was necessary, as we announced in our current report on Form 8-K filed November 15, 2018. Since then we have worked diligently and the company has achieved significant milestone in this process. We deliver a draft of the fiscal 2017 10-K with restating financial statements from 2015 and 2016 to our independent auditors in late January. They are reviewing the draft 10-K and are working to complete their integrated audit. As a result of our conclusions, our independent auditors continue to perform more testing of our accounting analyzes and internal control assessment. We are working closely each day with our independent auditors to complete the remaining audit procedures. Our internal audit team is developing a prioritized remediation roadmap to address the material weaknesses from our internal control assessments. We continue our procedures on fiscal 2018 financials in parallel and are making solid progress. So to close, we remain laser focused on resolving our SEC filings. We continue to build industry-leading technology solutions for a data hungry world. We\u2019re excited for the rest of 2019 and beyond. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll first go to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just a few, if I could, Charles maybe \u2013 would you be able to give us an update on the macro environment, demand across regions, and what you\u2019re seeing in the current quarter? And maybe you can talk about what drove the EMEA strength and then I had few follow-ups. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. We did observed macroeconomic and it will be choppy and we believe we have add weaker than last year. However, we saw new fallback have been very, very strong, get Cascade Lake in storage and other platform. So we believe this year, I mean, at 2019, we happy to see our growing year in term of our market share. And we are carefully observed the change in Cascade Lake. And our memory price travel well everything is under careful control from Supermicro point of view. David Ryzhik : And one of the larger enterprise storage vendors, on its earnings call yesterday had noted some weakness with large enterprise companies in the U.S., elongated purchasing decisions, more scrutiny around buying systems. Have you seen this as well? I was just curious. Charles Liang : Yes. From our point of view, I mean, March quarter had been very deteriorate result quarter over in the history. Well, this year, we can feel so far so good. We see all our change is \u2013 we feel really positive to us. David Ryzhik : And on the last update call in November, you had noted that you were beginning to see some demand return from customers that initially paused after the Bloomberg article. Has this continued? have you seen an improvement from customers that initially had made a pause? Charles Liang : Yes. We see the improvement and the business is going down, put it in normal and positive from our cutting the fee. David Ryzhik : Great. And then just on Cascade Lake, just wondering what your expectations are. I guess from a calendar year 2019 perspective, when does this start ramping for Super Micro from a revenue perspective? And you made some interesting comments around Optane DC persistent memory, would love your opinion on how material this could be in this cycle or do you think that it really ramps in subsequent server cycles? Thank you. Charles Liang : Yes. thank you. We believe what Cascade Lake would be a big change for Super Micro? Although we\u2019ve started shipping our central recently now would this be not interest from customer side, because that would be the performance and as toward DC persistent memory, it\u2019s a good way on the niche market and we have some customer really interest for those applications kind of large database and kind of a big data kind of application. We did see some customer meeting in case in that area. David Ryzhik : And what drove the high ASP per compute node? Charles Liang : More and more customer buy or compete with the solution, not really including or a hardware and some management sort of layout. So, because higher percentage of \u2013 much higher percentage of computer system instead of platform not to our ASP would continue to grow. And also more people move to a price, especially NVMe that also grow our ASP and this trend will continue for 2019 after this. David Ryzhik : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you. And congrats on strong results, strong guidance. Difference between systems and components, did you give that, if not, can you? Charles Liang : We did not, but the second \u2013 systems were 82%. Nehal Chokshi : 82%. Great. And just to be clear, were you saying that this guidance reflects a normal seasonality or not? Kevin Bauer : Well, certainly, it\u2019s normal seasonality, but as we had said last quarter, we are cognizant of the macros that are out there. And so therefore we\u2019ve tried to factor that into our thinking. We also know that customers are trying to determine, if they go for the next technology recycle or not, so that could pause their decisions a little bit. And then lastly, certainly, there are some components that are declining in value and customers\u2019 time, their purchases sometimes around that. So those are the kinds of the themes that we thought. Charles Liang : Yes, talking about Intel, new CPU, Cascade Lake Zen [ph] with our about April timeframe. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Got it. And then historically Super Micro has had four to six quarters of 20% plus year-over-year growth. You guys just did that from; I think beginning of 2017 to September of 2018. And then you have sub-20% year-over-year growth and it looks like we\u2019re looking at two quarters of that being the case, it all averages out to 20% to a 20% CAGR over what the past 12 years, which is incredible. But well, why shouldn\u2019t we believe we are at the beginning of a digestion period at this point here? Charles Liang : Yes. Again, this quarter, I mean on the March quarter, I guess about two major impacts, one is on memory price in fresh NVMe price drop, now as you\u2019re aware lower Aspeed that it will beat and also sort marcoeconomic and process cascade won\u2019t be ready then perhaps until April or May, that\u2019s what we try to be conservative with this quarter, March quarter. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. All right. And then, let\u2019s look at non-GAAP OpEx was up about $6 million versus Q2, it is some expenses, Kevin done not too sure if that was included a non-GAAP OpEx or not, but can you just give it a little bit more color around that Q2 uptick? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So, I had mentioned in the call that there were expenses related to certainly our engineers, developing first products for Cascade Lake. And so that was one element of them pulling materials for that. I mentioned that we had employee bonus this year and we have this quarter rather. And we did have something unusual for the company and that we did have a reserve for credit loss, which doesn\u2019t happen very often. Nehal Chokshi : And what was your reason for apparent loss? Kevin Bauer : Just a customer having problems. Nehal Chokshi : Got you. Okay. And thoughts on how this OpEx should trend and also gross margin should trend for the march quarter? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So certainly, the gross margin for this quarter was quite an uptick as compared to what we\u2019ve had historically, most recently as you remember, I called about that we had customer mix that went into our favor as well as we did have a pretty good excess inventory quarter. I\u2019m not sure that EN always going to repeat over the course of time, but do you remember that what I\u2019ve said is that we would be trying to work on gross margin at a modest pace over time. So, this quarter, we certainly had a good one, but in the trends, we\u2019re trying to improve modestly over roughly about 13.5% that we\u2019ve been at for a period of time. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Kevin Bauer : Operator, I think there\u2019s one more question on the queue. Operator : Yes. We\u2019ll take our follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : Hi, thanks. David Ryzhik kicking in for Mehdi. thanks for the follow-up. Kevin, you didn\u2019t note lower memory pricing as a reason for the strength in gross margins. Was memory a benefit to gross margins in the quarter? Kevin Bauer : As I said earlier, it\u2019s really customer mix. Since I\u2019ve gotten here, we\u2019ve done a little bit more in terms of looking at our gross margin mix by customer and our portfolio. So, we want to be cognizant of the fact of where we have margin for customers, kind of like in a banding way. And so that allows us from time-to-time, when we want to bid to win business, we do it in the context of the entire portfolio. And so, I think it\u2019s just really looking at our customer mix a little bit more sharply, not necessarily a significant impact from memory in the December quarter. David Ryzhik : And any reason for the tick-up in inventory days? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We made some purchases at quarter-end that we thought were advantageous. David Ryzhik : Great. And I was just curious on the storage and overall storage; I believe I heard 20% growth year-over-year. Any sense on, maybe the breakout within that of traditional versus NexGen? Charles Liang : I guess both of our traditional and new generation, we\u2019re able to grow with most of our new generation especially SSD NVMe based, we believe, it will be much higher pressure to grow. Kevin Bauer : Yes. traditional came down a little bit and NexGen grew handsomely. David Ryzhik : Okay, great. Any color around what drove that, that growth in NexGen? Charles Liang : NexGen as you know, I mean, we are the fourth company to delivers order with new form factor memory to the market as U.2, Ruler, NF1 on Samsung and EDSFF exactly the market leader and that kind of go to customer have very good response. Kevin Bauer : I think in addition to that we\u2019ve been talking about G2000 customers and as we have now left year, some of those G2000 customers have, we have an appreciably stronger business with them then we did 12 months ago. David Ryzhik : Great. And what percentage of overall revenue is G2000 is \u2013 I think in the past, you\u2019ve maybe called it enterprise, but what percent of revenue is that driving? Kevin Bauer : Yes. we\u2019re probably not going to break that out right now. David Ryzhik : Okay. Okay. And then last one, IDC, what percentage of overall revenue was that and have you seen any wins with new customers in the IDC space? Perry Hayes : David, this is Perry. So, G2K that we talk about is a combination of both the IDC group that we used to talk about. And it also includes the enterprise group that we\u2019re now talking about. So they\u2019re actually gathering what Kevin\u2019s already provided. David Ryzhik : understood, understood. Thanks so much. I really appreciate the follow-ups. Thanks. Operator : And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you everyone for joining us today, and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal 2019 business update conference all. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

And now we would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. Perry Hayes : Good morning, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the third fiscal quarter 2019, which ended March 31, 2019. During today's conference call, Super Micro will address the company's filings of the Form 10-Q/A and Form 10-K for 2017 and efforts to become current with its remaining SEC filings and the company's preliminary financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent Form 10-K filing for 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlook. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first comment on our 10-K filing. We are pleased to have filed our fiscal 2017 10-K. Not able to ensure the accuracy of our financial reporting has taken more than 18 months of focus and collaborative work between Super Micro's team and our outside adviser teams. It became clear through this effort that some of our process and procedures had not kept up with our faster growth, the size of our company and the pace of our business. The team acknowledged that necessary internal control need to be strengthened for precise revenue recognition quarter-by-quarter. Despite all of our business, transaction result in eventual revenue. Most importantly, I would like to thank all of our Super Micro employees, partners, customers and investors for their dedication and support during this period. Although our sales effort had been certainly impacted by our 10-K filing delay and fourth negative place [indiscernible] last year. This did not affect our growth plan, and our foundation had been the strongest in our 25 years history.  Now let me comment on the March quarter. Our third quarter revenue will be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, which is below our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 5% year-over-year deduction. The main reasons had been the key components price drop and volatile microeconomic condition.  Earnings per share will be in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 compared to the range of $0.48 to $0.52 last year and the range of $0.57 to $0.61 last quarter. System revenue was approximately 81% of total revenue for at least last year.  Both system and node ASP were higher year-over-year due to mutual mix of computer system. Revenue from Global 2000 accounts and accelerated computing were higher year-over-year, offsetting lower storage and IoT revenues. We are increasing our capacity for future growth. As our business continue to rapidly scale with over 1.2 million servers and storage systems shipped globally last year, increasing our production and service capacity and capability is vital. We recently held groundbreaking ceremony for our Asia's Science & Technology Park expansion. It was attended by over 200 business and government officials. The new 800,000 square feet building will expand our production capacity, hardware and software R&D and our RSD2 methodology based on our resource saving design and rack scale design technologies. RSD2 will enable us to provide a more power efficient, cost effective and flexible data center Building Block Solutions to the market, including application optimized solutions for medium and small-sized customers in data centers. We are also expanding our Silicon Valley stakeholders. Building 23 is the third of 5 new facilities in our San Jose Green Computing Park as the only global Tier 1 server and storage provider to manufacturing Silicon Valley. We are aware of producing to provide the best possible solutions to the most innovative enterprise, data centers, channel and cloud customers.  Super Micro leads the industry with the second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor efforts. The recently launched Xeon processor known as Cascade Lake is a refresh of Skylake launch last year. The frequency of CPU and memory module refresh highlights the importance of our resource saving design to the industry and to the environment. Supporting new CPU with new technology, including Intel Optane DC persistent memory NVMe, NF1, and EDSFF. The new Super Micro X11 generation [indiscernible] put online again is offering leading performance in the base of TCO and TCE, total cost to environment, for all of our data centers around the world empowered by highly efficient, longevity subsystem that lasts over 12 years, the recent service system especially optimum for feed deployment on edge [indiscernible] and remote micro data centers.  Our high-density systems such as BigTwin when you cannot scale NVMe storage, resource saving SuperBlade and MicroBlade have been the preferred choice for many public and private cloud customers. This low-latency, high-frequency, high-density, high-capacity system are exactly the basis of solutions for supporting the strong wave of 5G, deep learning, AI and cloud age applications. With that, I expect that this optimal server solutions will show strong growth momentum in a way our market growth time faster than the IT hardware industry average. In summary, we are pleased to have filed the 2017 10-K and began the process of improving our internal controls. Now we are able to focus more on the bright future and tremendous opportunities ahead of Super Micro. We are moving towards the meeting with our increased global manufacturing capacity and innovation such as the resource saving design. I'm fully confident that we will continue to rule the market and to provide the best server installing solutions for today and tomorrow's demanding workload. With 25 years of strong foundation paved by the best engineering minds, enhanced operations and focused sales force, Super Micro is on the rise again. For the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019, we are guiding net sales in the range of $770 million to $830 million with great position to start our faster growth trend again. And now, I will hand the section over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First, I will address the current outlook of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the third quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal third quarter revenue was within the range of $742 million to $752 million. On a year-over-year basis, EMEA was the weakest geography with a decline of approximately 21% followed by a 10% decline in Asia, offset by a 7% increase in the U.S.  Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 15.5% to 15.7%. Our margin benefited from improved customer and product mix, partially due to lower sales to Asia, lower storage revenue and better component pricing.  Operating expenses were lower this quarter due to lower employee bonuses, offset by an increased reserves for bad debt. In this quarter, we released $3.2 million tax reserve related to a lapse in the statutes of limitation in the tax jurisdiction. We estimate non-GAAP diluted EPS this quarter was within the range of $0.48 to $0.52. We continued to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $112 million. After deducting CapEx of $7 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $105 million for the quarter. On a cumulative basis over the last 3 quarters, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $189 million that has allowed us to pay down our loans and reach a positive cash position. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased to 106 days. The increase is primarily due to an increase in inventory days. Based on the methodology of averaging with the previous strong quarter, actual inventory declined sequentially. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. Now let me comment on the filing of our fiscal 2017 10-K. We are very pleased to have filed our Form 10-K of -- for 2017 that included the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal 2015 and 2016. This was a comprehensive undertaking that involved a detailed and thorough examination of our historical financial statements as well as our accounting policies and procedures and our internal controls. The primary cause of restatements and adjustments was the timing of revenue recognition and certain changes to accounting for inventory and other adjustments. All the sales that we examined will be ultimately recognized as revenue.  As Charles said earlier, in our 2017 Form 10-K, we acknowledge weaknesses in our internal controls that existed as of June 2017. I encourage everyone to fully read our report on internal controls over financial reporting where we articulate our remediation plan and progress to date. We're a different company today and are better able to address our remaining challenges. So to close, I would like to thank the extended team of devoted employees who put in countless hours to achieve this goal. We are turning our attention to finishing fiscal 2018 for audit and are remain focused on becoming fully current on our SEC filings. And to our shareholders, we appreciate your support through this long process and look forward to updating you again next quarter. Perry Hayes : As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session next where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. First off, congrats on the 10-K filing for fiscal '17. So I just wanted to understand March quarter. In mid-February, you offered the target of $800 million to $860 million and it came out materially lower. What happened between mid-February and end of March? Was it just customers pulling orders? Or just wanted to learn more about what happened there? And I have a follow up. Charles Liang : Kevin, you want to take that one? Kevin Bauer : Yes, sure. So certainly, as we went through the quarter, we saw the same softening that the rest of the industry saw. We did observe customers' behavior towards the end of the quarter. We've gotten some feedback that they were digesting purchases as regard towards the end of the quarter. And so that was news that we found in that second part of the quarter. And as Charles articulated earlier, we're giving similar guidance a little bit lower as we go into the next quarter. So we think that the first half, we will have to go through a period of digestion in the industry that maybe we didn't fully comprehend 90 days ago. And certainly, we look forward to the second half of '19 depending upon how the macro situation clears up over time. David Ryzhik : Okay. And in storage, Charles, you touched on storage maybe a little softer. Can you elaborate on the trends there? Was it end demand driven macro or market share driven? Just would love any more info on the storage business? Charles Liang : I guess, the macroeconomic in the lower key components price as well as the tariff that will have some impact. At the same time, we are aggressively moving to a new NVMe storage solution, and we see some signal to recover gradually. David Ryzhik : Got it. And then on gross margins, it looks like a pretty sizable uptick. Perhaps, maybe you can rank the drivers, mix, components or geographic mix, would love a little more detail there? Charles Liang : Kevin, you want to take that one? Kevin Bauer : Yes. In rank order and don't know about the relative materiality of these in the way that they are ranked, but I think really the product mix in terms of storage was probably the most large impact than probably the customer mix and then lastly, the component pricing changes over time. David Ryzhik : And is it safe to say that we can anticipate this type of level for the June quarter and the balance of the year? Kevin Bauer : Yes. I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think we have a very good alignment of vectors in this particular quarter to the extent that we have continued decline in component costs in terms of memory and NVMe. We will have some continued improvement over the quarter that we have before, which was roughly about 14% or so. But certainly, I don't expect that it'll be up to this level. I think we had a great confluence of events this quarter that put us 1 quarter ahead of what we expect to do in terms of some sustainable, modest improvement in our gross margin profile that -- from our historical patterns over the course of time. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Based on the gross margin approximation and the EPS, it sounds like OpEx was down significantly Q-over-Q, is that correct? Kevin Bauer : It was modestly down. So as we said, the key things were that since we had smaller revenues, we made a lower purchasing for employee bonuses, suffered a little bit in terms of some bad debt, but not significantly on a non-GAAP basis. There are a little bit more spread on GAAP basis and that we had some costs associated with the restatement as well as last quarter's activity related to responding to the article that were less in this quarter. Nehal Chokshi : Right. So on a non-GAAP basis, R&D would have been about flattish Q-over-Q? And therefore, that's one of the reason why you remain confident in the long-term outlook? Kevin Bauer : If I recall correctly, R&D grew a little bit, but it wasn't tremendous. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then there've been some reports, I think, from Bloomberg that Super Micro has asset suppliers to move their supply chain out of China, is that true? And is that -- first address that maybe. Charles Liang : Yes. Basically to fulfill our increasing the business, we believe that demand from the market will continue to be strong. So we are indeed growing our capacity goal in Silicon Valley, in Taiwan and in Netherlands. So it's part of our long-term growth plan. Kevin Bauer : Nehal, I think that those articles that you've referenced were not accurate in reporting. We are increasing our capacity, as we mentioned, in our Taiwan facility, primarily for growth as well as for the Building 23 that we're building here in San Jose, again primarily growth, for future expectation on our growth. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. To be clear, I think that the article was saying that Super Micro was asking its motherboard suppliers to move manufacturing out of China, not so much Super Micro's assembly and internal manufacturing capacity. So... Kevin Bauer : Yes. We are not going to comment on the stories. Can you have another question? Nehal Chokshi : Sure. You have thoughts on how HP Enterprise buying Cray may change the competitive dynamics for the high-performance computing portion of Super Micro's business? Charles Liang : Indeed, our overall business still are growing well. And we believe with the new Cascade Lake solution, NVMe, as you may know, we are truly build for new generation memory, NVMe, NF1, EDSFF. So we do believe our growth will be strong in the coming future. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And can you give approximate performance by verticals, those being storage, data center, IoT, high-performance computing, enterprise and channel? Kevin Bauer : Nehal, we are not going to break that out at this time. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. All right. And can you provide some guidance as far as what was actually the fully diluted shares outstanding for the March quarter? Kevin Bauer : I will provide that to you after the call. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Kevin Bauer : Yes, it's still roughly about $50 million or so. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Staiger with Odeon Capital. Michael Staiger : On the gross -- just kind of a clarification on gross margins. Are we -- should we expect a similar level? Or is there a range that you think you can provide movement into the next few quarters? And on top of that if you are expanding capacity, are you expecting, let me just say, radical shift in demand? What was the demand pressure look like into the next few quarters? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So as I said earlier, we certainly had a great confluence of events this quarter that led us achieve the gross margin results for the quarter. We had been, not too many quarters ago, in the mid-13s and last quarter, I think, we hit 14.1%. This quarter we had that sizable jump because of all of those events. We do have the ability to get cheaper cost for a moment in time before they are passed on to customers and the ramp and severity of those price changes could occur into the future, but maybe not to the extent. So to kind of give you some kind of a feeling for that, I think grounding ourselves in that low 14% gross margin and then modest improvement over that is really good trend that we had articulated last quarter. And I think that, that's still the case today. Michael Staiger : And just as a quick follow-up. Can we expect the cash flow performance to be in a similar range going forward? Kevin Bauer : Our cash flow is very much tied to our working capital means. So the cash flow probably will consistently work along those lines that we have today until we start to show significant growth. And when we have significant growth, we will have to reinvest in working capital in order to achieve that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Lopez with Vertical Group. Jonathan Lopez : My first question, I think, the first half weakness is certainly understandable given the confluence of things happening around you. As far as my question for you here is, as you think about the second half of the calendar year and particularly about the Cascade Lake pipeline, can you just categorize how things are shaping up? I mean one way to look at this is Intel's implied guidance suggests a very strong second half of the calendar year. I'm wondering if that's consistent with how you guys think about the second half of the year or is there something either customer related, mix related, geographically related that may make you marginally different from that implied outlook? Charles Liang : Yes. We believe second half will be stronger this year for a couple of reasons, one is Cascade Lake system [indiscernible] already qualify and it's much better performance [indiscernible], which will move that aggressively. And second is the second-generation storage, NVMe including EDSFF and NF1. We see customer start to ready to move [indiscernible] and together with our 10-K delayed program had been almost fit. So that will be a positive trend for us. Jonathan Lopez : Excellent. My second question is, again, I'm obviously not looking for guidance here, but just conceptually, you guys are pretty comfortably outpaced the server market in aggregate for the last multiple quarters. I'm wondering as you think about, say this calendar year, would you expect to continue to be able to do that. Or again sort of same question there may be some geographical product exposure things that may make that different or more difficult in this calendar year versus the prior 2? Charles Liang : Yes, we are prepared for the tariff, the trailer program and continue to make our capacity, our capability and product line ready. So we believe the near future and [indiscernible] and yet to come future will be great thing for us, especially our internal control system have been tremendously improved and new SAP implement has been much stable now. So our business is getting ready for another trend of faster growth, I believe. Jonathan Lopez : Okay. Helpful. A quick question, I haven't gotten through the refiled document entirely, but my recollection was counter Q3 or so of 2017, China was about 10% of your total revenues. I' m wondering : a, can you just update us at least directionally on what your China exposure is right now? And b, well, I guess, b and c; b, any thoughts, I know you just referenced tariffs, but any thoughts in terms of local consumption, what if anything recent developments mean? And I guess, c, Huawei is, obviously, I believe, the fourth-largest server rendered by units as in the last quarter, not a lot in the U.S., but certainly a lot of European exposure for them. I am wondering, just conceptually, what do you think the current developments may mean for perhaps share potential for you in geographies where you overlap? Charles Liang : Basically, we continue to grow globally. I mean U.S.A. and Russia are our main market, but Europe, Asia, including the Japan, China, we continue our plan to global -- to grow globally. And we are much [indiscernible] forever to grow globally. Jonathan Lopez : That's helpful. Would you mind just updating on that China exposure specifically though? Charles Liang : China market, indeed, we feel nothing really has changed. So we just continue to rollout stable plan and our partnership there also is stable growing. Kevin Bauer : John, our China exposure can be in any quarter somewhere between 10% to 15% of the overall revenue. As you know, the March quarter, there is a lot of seasonality with the China's lunar New Year, et cetera, that impacts our revenue for China. Jonathan Lopez : Sure. That's helpful. So my very last question, I understand that -- I don't understand entirely, but it sounds like there's clearly been some working capital held on the cash balance, and I think you guys started to get a bit more proactive on some of those metrics. At the moment you've got over $160 million of cash on the balance sheet and I realized, what you are, I think, effectively telling us is that, that's going to reflect around a little bit as working capital trends up, but I'm wondering just in light of events over the last 2 years or so, any higher appetite for things like share repurchase or some amount of capital return or is that tables until we get some level of visibility into what maybe more sustainable free cash generation looks like? Kevin Bauer : Yes, I think we had a good run over the course of the last 4 or 5 quarters. And as you said, we've paid more attention to it. We have been able to drive cash flow. I think we need more time to make sure that we go to a few cycles to get a real confident and grow our cash flow and then I think it would be only some later date that we would look to think about those things as being potentials on the table. But at the moment, we don't foresee any repurchase plans that we would take to the Board or suggest to them. Operator : And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Yes, thank you for joining us today, and have a great one. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Business Update Conference Call . We do appreciate your participation.

All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlook. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue will be in the range of $825 million to $835 million which is the midpoint of our quarterly guidance of $[800] million, it is 15% lower than last quarter and 11% higher than last quarter. Full-year fiscal year revenue was approximately $3.5 billion and represents an increase of approximately 4% from last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.57 to $0.61 compared to that range of $0.75 to $0.79 last year and the range of $0.48 to $0.52 last quarter. System revenue was approximately 81% of the total revenue. System ASP were a bit lower year-over-year mostly due to lower period and then price which impacts revenue. We launched a comprehensive portfolio of over 100 lean server and storage system supporting a new second-generation Xeon scalable processor called Cascade Lake. The new product bring world record performance and efficiency improvement to enterprise, Cloud, 5G and AI reached up to 50% TCO. We have seen strong interest in this new product and advance over our new product that outpace previous generation. It was a challenging period for traditional strong quarter. Volatile market conditions end up in trade tension and some key component price reduction impact our quarterly revenues. However, the trade challenge, including tariff impact will minimize our strong U.S. based manufacturing presence and our distributed global manufacturing footprint in the USA, Taiwan and in Netherlands. We also see positive signs with our key product names such as BigTwin and SuperBlade which achieved higher sales on both quarterly and yearly basis. Importantly, we see great opportunity as our long-term investment in operation and improved internal efficiency and we are in the growth of our product assume the market demand for application optimized high performance driven products and not declined. On our product side, we remain focused on that delivery solution based on our new resource driven architecture, Super Micro\u2019s unique architecture, this aggregate major sub-systems separating compute, storage, higher power, and reduce those can be differentiated along upgrade independently allowing data centers to reduce different cycle cost and their impact to the environment by reducing power consumption and [e-waste]. Some components such as an opportunity power price encourage us than IoT devices can remain in deploying for up to 20 years. Saving achieved through sheer power including whereas vehicle intrusion. On the typical three to four years cycle, Super Micro reached, they delivered up to 30% hardware costs each new operating cycle. We continue to deliver positive market products introducing first-based server and storage system that supported EDSFF storage drive. This optimize NVMe drive deliver up to six days mostly and up to five days reduction of which additional storage which is ideal for the highest performance worked for our applications requiring higher apps such as autonomous driving, engine, cloud database, artificial intelligence, HPC, scientific research and more. We believe EDSFF will become main storage contractor in the near future. For 5G, Super Micro is convenient to providing them most advanced solutions for age, the modern micro data and core networks that provide the security, IoT, multiple access is complete. Open radio access network, the need for powerful server across a wide variety of implementation will only increase which continue to allow the 5G network. Super Micro H server and who transform enterprise and important this intelligent connectivity from IoT devices to cloud. AI from H also made across as we provide, optimize and validate NVIDIA, CPU collaborating and engineer to our customers. Saving the space for last, let me have a brief review of our trending architectures with many innovations for high speed connectivity design. These new products online as you know assistance connectivity and continue and basic, two of this new exciting projects are called (inaudible) service but at the same time target in Q1, 2010. In summary, we see tremendous potential opportunity in our enterprise, cloud, 5G and AI that will benefit the Super Micro results that we published. I\u2019m very confident in the strength of our products and continue improvement of our operating fundamentals. Regarding our market cycle, our business model first go to market design that delivers breakthrough innovation in performance efficiency and TCO, we achieve comfort. Moreover we will conveniently invest more effort in our strategic relationships to build a stronger presence in key market and target the vertical customers. I expect this action will result in continued market share growth and improvement of our financial performance and now I will hand the section over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal fourth quarter revenue was within the range of $825 million to $835 million. Our geographies were lower on a year-over-year basis with EMEA approximately 14% lower, Asia 19% lower and the U.S. 14% lower. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 14.7% to 14.9%. Our margins have steadily improved since last year and then benefited from improved customer mix, product mix and better component pricing. Operating expenses were slightly lower this quarter due to lower reserves for bad debt offset by higher sales and marketing expense. We estimate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share range, this quarter was within the range of $0.57 to $0.61 per share. We continue to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $81 million. After divesting CapEx of $11 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $70 million for the quarter. On the cumulative basis over the last four quarters, we estimate free cash flow with approximately $259 million, this quarter our cash conversion cycle decreased to 91 days, the decrease was primarily due to a 21-day increase in inventory days to 92 days. Actual inventory on a dollar basis declined sequentially. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. Now let me comment on our progress on our remaining delinquent SEC filings. We recently completed our work on the fiscal 2018 financials and have submitted them for audit. We're now working on fiscal 2019 inclusive of the efforts, finalized revenue under both the 605 and 606 revenue recognition standard. We will be under a two-year engagement with our auditors for both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 that will enable some efficiency. The team remains focused on becoming fully trained on our SEC filings. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session with sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead sir. David Ryzhik : David Ryzhik for Mehdi, thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on gross margins. I believe they were down from the prior quarter, I guess from around 15.5% to 14.7% to 14.9%. Just wondering what the dynamics were over there. Obviously revenue ticked up, components, prices probably tick down. So just wondering if what was driving the decline and I had a follow-up. Kevin Bauer : Sure, no problem. This is Kevin. Last quarter when we highlighted the fact that we were in the mid-15s, we've cautioned the group that we looked like we had a very good quarter in terms of everything aligning up perfectly. And as we talked to this same question last quarter, we highlighted the fact that we were in the mid 13s not too long ago had broached 14 towards the mid-year of 2019 and we're in between 14 and 15 and so we highlighted that as being some steady progress as we went through the quarters. So we highlighted that that last quarter things lined up very, very well. So I don't necessarily think it's declined. I think that our continued progress is not perfectly linear. David Ryzhik : And perhaps maybe you can talk about the overall server pricing environment and maybe provide an overview of just demand trends that you're seeing in the current quarter and what your outlook is moving forward? I appreciate that and then a follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes, I mean as you know the market, this is choppy and macroeconomic that it be soft. However our solution outperform others especially wins to Cascade Lake, very big product name, yes just a bit of it. So we expect our business will continue improvement although maybe not very fast but achieving revenue is booming and especially in the new technology we have the positive sign for our business. Kevin Bauer : Yes, this is Kevin. I think if we put our lens a little bit shorter in time as you know we've looked at this quarter's guidance certainly we are observing and are part of the macro situation that many of our competitors have already voiced out. Usually this quarter is seasonally down and when the macro conditions are like this sometimes visibility is poor. And so we have those three elements that were in our mind as we set guidance to this next quarter. David Ryzhik : Got it, thanks. And then just last one we'd love to get an update on where you are in your enterprise efforts. This is something you've mentioned in the past as far as building up the Enterprise effort services software maybe Fortune 500 accounts just would love an update there maybe new customer account figures anything there would be helpful? Thank you. Perry Hayes : Yes it\u2019s Perry. So yes, UK portion of our business which includes that enterprise section was approximately 20% little bit better than 20% of the overall revenue. Within that the enterprise section that's up year-over-year by about 12%. So we're making steady progress in there with the number of customers that we have in the business that we're doing. David Ryzhik : Thank you, I'll get back in the queue. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Thanks and congrats on what I think is a fiscal year that represents records on cash from operations and non-GAAP net income. So you now have a $36 million net cash position. That's 29% of your market cap. And yes, I think on your trailing 12-month midpoint EPS that you've provided for the past 12 months looks like you're trading at 5x even net income. So are you guys willing to put that net cash to work in terms of buybacks once you're able to i.e. once the 10-Ks are indeed up to date? Perry Hayes : Yes, I think if you look at the cash that we have now certainly we have harvested some of that from the balance sheet. I think roughly I've got $259 million working capital harvesting with roughly about $70 million of that and we know that we're going to leave that soon and we continue to grow again. So I know this is a question that came up last time, we are just going to continue to plot forward in terms of understanding what our working capital needs are as growth returns. We feel pretty strongly about that. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then that's great that you've estimated the fiscal year 2018 financials for finalization by your auditors. Can you confirm that the submitted financials are within the previously announced revenue and EPS ranges? Kevin Bauer : No, I'm not going to be able to confirm that. That's not something that I addressed at this moment. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Lopez of Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Jon Lopez : Hi, thanks. I\u2019ve got a couple of clarifications first did you guys give us rather would you give us the number, the service system number please as a percentage of the business that was service systems? Charles Liang : Yes, we said in the script -- it's Charles script that was about 81% was services, I'm sorry servers. Jon Lopez : 81? Okay 81, I\u2019m sorry I missed that thanks. My second question we don't really have all the moving pieces I guess but it looks like OpEx was kind of flattish sequentially. A, I\u2019m wondering if you can confirm that and then B just any thoughts on how that ought to trend obviously you guys know that the environment's not terrific right now. So I\u2019m wondering if you guys are doing anything proactive for the balance of the year on the OpEx side? Charles Liang : So it was relatively flattish. We talked about the two components that wiggled. I think as we look forward, we will you know we have confidence in our long-term business -- to investment. I don't see that would have large increases in OpEx for in line with what we think needs to be investment for the future. Jon Lopez : Got you. Okay, helpful. I was a bit surprised by one of the comments you guys made I apologize, can\u2019t remember who made it but some version of the Cascade Lake pacing is ahead of prior generations. I\u2019m wondering if you could just flush that out a little bit maybe not entirely consistent with we're picking up elsewhere, so I'm wondering if it's specific to your, mix your SKUs. So if you guys could just spend a second on that and then in doing so, I know you're not going to give guidance on that, I\u2019m not asking for it but as you think about trending toward the end of the calendar year. Any thoughts on just seasonality and how applicable that may be given the environment and given what you're seeing with the Cascade Lake based projects? Thanks. Charles Liang : Yes, thank you. I mean as you know we are technology leading company. So one-day, everyday a new technology, we had chance to grow better. Given the macroeconomic [inaudible] choppy in coming months. So we tried to be conservative. However, our Cascade Lake I think [has grown] very well especially the new platform including BigTwin, there had been continued growing (inaudible) retail savings, they start to get more and more attraction and like I just mentioned the recent results launched another tool, new platform including [inaudible]. So although it is in early stage, we believe in [inaudible] those new technologies, we have our growth [inaudible]. Jon Lopez : If I could just follow-up on that, you make a good point which is you guys have put a lot of SKUs out around Cascade Lake, it appears as though significantly more in relative basis than your peers have and so I\u2019m wondering do you -- would you view Cascade Lake as perhaps an opportunity for maybe like disproportionate share gain with cycle like i.e. are your competitors perhaps less focused on this excuse me on this iteration or this portion of the Intel platform than you guys are? Charles Liang : As you know there are lots of technology, kinds of ideas available including I just mentioned EDSFF and Samsung the [N81], those product line continue to gain market share. Although they are pretty new technology, but we see a [inaudible] data this year or early next year is where [inaudible] growth. Jon Lopez : That's great. Thanks very much, I appreciate it. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. David Ryzhik : Hi, David Ryzhik for Mehdi again. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just back to gross margins, I guess moving forward with lower component prices. Should we expect that to serve as a tailwind to gross margins moving forward? Kevin Bauer : Well, I think the reduction in kind of price obviously has slowed down but we've gone through a pretty steep ramp that we went through the last few quarters. We're not going to have that same kind of ramp on a go forward basis. So I think in terms of it helping us as one of the components in terms of improving our gross margins, I don't think that that's going to be in the same sustained uplift because those prices are the reduction in those prices is flattening out. David Ryzhik : Has that altered your decision making around inventory management as far as memory? Are you strategically adding components given the flattening out? Charles Liang : I will have to say we have been controlled everywhere in this DRAM and then price drop periods. So we will continue to monitor very closely. David Ryzhik : Great, and then just a question on storage. Would you be able to share the growth in NextGen storage versus traditional storage and overall storage? Charles Liang : Yes indeed. As basically our new storage form factor and any one is basically like EDSFF. We have plenty of new platform and we have a [good feeling] about in [inaudible]. David Ryzhik : And just lastly Charles would love to get your take on what you're seeing in hyperscale or internet data center, I know that's part of the G2000 but would love to hear what trends you're seeing amongst your customers there? Charles Liang : [inaudible] while we share with you, we continue to grow our economical scale in Taiwan and also in USA. So when our scale continues to grow in US we will be more competitive to beat those larger scale data centers. And we are preparing now. David Ryzhik : Thanks very much. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, so I think you stated that you expected to have gained market share during the quarter. So what do you think the market actually did because Intel data center group revenue was down 10% year-over-year about but their enterprise and government was down 31% year-over-year and you just said that you guys were up 12% year-over-year on the enterprise side. So just maybe give us a sense as far as what you think the market did and what portions of that Intel data center group metric are probably actually most relevant for gauging Super Micro performance? Charles Liang : Nehal, we don't always track a one-to-one request what their group does. And then again if you look at what they're tracking to and lot of it would be hyperscale et cetera and what that's not a major part of our business although we have some customers there. At the enterprise would be a separate sort of group there. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. Charles Liang : What I would say overall I mean we follow economics with scale compared to those, we would be more aggressively in both enterprise and super scale data centers. Nehal Chokshi : Got it, thank you. Operator : It appears at this time that we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter fiscal 2019 business update conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

And now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. Perry Hayes : Good afternoon and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the first quarter fiscal 2020, which ended September 30, 2019. During today's conference call, Super Micro will address the company's preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the company\u2019s efforts to become current with its remaining SEC filings. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the investor relations page at Super Micro's websites. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP and natural results and outlook. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue will be in the range of $788 million to $798 million, which exceeds midpoint of our quarterly guidance of $780 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 15.1% to 16.3%. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.61 to $0.65 compared to the range of $0.66 to $0.70 last year, in the range of $0.57 to $0.61 last quarter.  System revenue was approximately 80% of total revenue. System ASPs were lower year-over-year due to lower memory and SSD pricing, which impacts revenue. We see continued demand in the channel. We have upgrade of our portfolio and put to market innovation allow our partner to also application optimize solution to their customers. In addition to seasonality in the September quarter, there were several factors impacting our top line revenue. And overall industry wide slow down due to economic uncertainty, some push in purchasing from major data center customers and price reduction on key components using our systems. As recorded by our peer and industry analysts, server revenue has been down in 2019 and we saw that trend continue for our business in the second quarter. However, as we reach the end of this quarter, we\u2019ve begun to see signals of stabilization and early sign of seasonal straight from our key customers, as we begun including our inventory to take advantages of the opportunities.  Super Micro has long history that application optimal product will maximize our growth. We continue to develop new products and solutions, hopefully across major server and storage markets, including total solution, AI machine learning, 5G, IoT and data center. Combining the advantages that were introduced to our green computing and resource savings platform, we delivered concrete solution offerings with Red Hat, VMware, Nvidia and SAP providing certified and tested configurations that can reduce risk and accelerate ROI for our customers. Our offering [ph] between hyper converged [indiscernible] continue to be the most optimized solution for new generation solid customer delivery basically in cars feature, support, [indiscernible], NVMe, predictable IO, and high TTP of Intel 2nd Generation Xeon Scalable Processors.  With SAP we delivered the two new four way super servers as part of our Intel Select Solutions, with up to 12 terabytes of memory, that brings the power and cost saving of data center, system memory to the SAP HANA platforms. We cooperate with Nvidia homemade [ph] HGX Edge solution allowing customers to be manage their AI application on Super Micro\u2019s extensive edge GPU product line in cloud native environment. Moreover, we introduced a new class of 5G ready software defined networking platform that can be optimized to deliver accelerated AI differencing to their network page.  On AMD side, we start shipping Super Micro systems based on second generation AP processor, which [indiscernible] our previous generation A Plus system and provide much better performance and value. Last but not least, we have begun to deliver a set of [indiscernible] system product target for mega data centers. These products are uniquely optimized for the specific requirements of high volume scale data center customers. Our business solution allow us to leverage our existing product designs and customized performance, efficiency and cost requirements on demand. We see a similar opportunity for cloud data centers, optimized design and have therefore underway to deliver additional [indiscernible] to specialized products. Looking ahead, we see the pace of processor refresh cycles accelerating and has repeat our sales with the next level product update in the coming quarters. [indiscernible] we had keep up developing of our next generation Experia architectures for a complete family refresh. This new architecture we\u2019ll take full advantage for the upcoming innovations of Intel new processors like PCI Gen-4 more flexible IO, higher performance architecture, and new storage form factors. We have already started engaging with selected of our customers. Important to achieving our stated goals, we continue to innovate and improve our operational efficiency and scale, building a stronger global foundation. We have increased our capacity in engineering, manufacturing, operations, and service in our key strategic locations. This includes over 200,000 square feet of new facility space in our [indiscernible] completing path and more at our headquarters [ph]. In summary, although market conditions have been challenging, we continue to deliver significant server and storage innovations to the market. More importantly, we have globalized our R&D sales and operations to grow the discipline and focus needed to expand our market share. Fundamentally, we are more confident than ever in the strength of our products and operation improvements, which will empower us to achieve our business goals. And now, I hand the section over to Kevin. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First, I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal first quarter revenue within the range of $788 million to $798 million. Geographies were lower on a year-over-year basis with EMEA approximately 21% lower, Asia 22% lower and the U.S. 18% lower. Our estimated gross margin range on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis grow from 16% to 16.2% and 16.1% to 16.3%, respectively. Our margins improved from last year and benefited from lower key component costs, as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix. Our operating expenses were slightly lower this quarter due to lower reserves for bad debt, offset by the effect of annual salary increases and higher research and development expenses. We estimate our non-GAAP diluted EPS range this quarter was from $0.61 to $0.65 per diluted share. Due to the need to rebuild inventory this quarter for seasonal demand, cash flow generated from operations was lower than recent quarters at $5.5 million. After deducting for CapEx and investments of $13.3 million our free cash flow was negative $7.8 million. Our closing cash position was a robust $239 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 89 days, the day sales outstanding was 43 days where days payable outstanding was 48 days, with inventory days increasing to 93. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. Now, let me comment on the progress of our remaining delinquent SEC filings. Last quarter, we reported that we had submitted our fiscal 2018 financials for audit. We're now able to report that we had also completed work on the fiscal 2019 financials under both the 605 and 606 revenue recognition standards and submitted them for audit at the end of September. Concurrent with the financial statement audit, we have continued the testing and assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we have prepared drafts of our SEC filings. The team remains laser focused on becoming fully current on our SEC filings, which also includes the 10-Q filing for this first quarter of fiscal 2020. Perry Hayes : As indicated previously, we will have an abbreviated Q&A. In which sell side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Operator at this time, we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thanks and congratulations on solid results relative to the guidance, especially on the gross margin very nicely done there. On the guidance here, looks like at the midpoint, you're getting to up 5% Q-o-Q. How's that compared to your typical seasonality? Kevin Bauer : So in general, we believe that it's similar to our normal seasonality. As Charles outlined, we saw some signs of stabilization and a little bit of growth as we enter into the next quarter. So we believe it's kind of in line. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And I think you gave the color on why the gross margin was up year-over-year. And I think one of the elements was component costs declining rapidly. And that's certainly true on a year-over-year basis, but I was under the impression on a Q-over-Q basis. There has been some pressure yet you did see strong gross margin on Q-over-Q basis. So could you tease that out as far as why did you also see the strong Q-over-Q gross margin? Kevin Bauer : Yes, I think we had mentioned last quarter that, as compared to the quarter previous to that that still there were some mix and customer influences that are in there. And certainly that was the case this quarter as it rebounded back. So, we continue to look at that gross margin, trying to ensure that we make some periodic progress overtime that we have talked about the quarters on quarters. But without getting into too specific details, we're really calling out the fact that on a sequential basis, this is really going to be customer and mix orientation and it will be less of the impact on the sequential basis related to the component changes. Nehal Chokshi : Understood. Okay. And looks like there was about $2.5 million of incremental OpEx Q-over-Q basis; A, is that correct? B, can you help guide us which buckets we should attribute those to? Kevin Bauer : You mean in terms of\u2026 Nehal Chokshi : For the September quarter, yes. Kevin Bauer : Yes, so I called out that the key things in terms of the sequential basis were really that we had less bad debt. And then in addition to that as we go into the September quarter our annual merit increases are always affected with our fiscal new year in January 1st. And then, as Charles had mentioned, we have some new product development initiatives that were sequentially increased quarter-over-quarter. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, I'm going to yield the floor for now. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I want to first just ask you kind of on a demand environment. I know you talked about demand, the demand environment being somewhat challenging. But you also mentioned that you started to see signs of improvement. There has been some kind of mixed data points on some of the hyper scale cloud demand, some suggesting that there might be a push out in server refresh cycles.  I'm just curious of how would you characterize the cadence of your customers as it relates to kind of server, refreshes, do you think that there could be any kind of a pause in front of some of the timing around things like Cooper Lake from Intel, or even Ice Lake, just any kind of color on what you're seeing as far as purchasing behavior for the customers and particularly some of the hyper scale customers you have? Charles Liang : It's a very dynamic market and that\u2019s we say new processor is getting available. So as technology leading company, we have very strong new product available each month or each quarter. So overall we feel pretty positive as to the macro market and the whole industry demand at this moment we feel it's still kind of hard to predict. But overall we feel not too bad. Kevin Bauer : But I think on the backdrop we reminded you of this a number of times that our exposure to hyper scalars is not nearly as much as some of the other competitors that you may have in mind. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then as my follow up on the component pricing dynamics, I know just kind of thinking about the progression as you see going forward between DRAM and SSD pricing, there's been some indication that the SSD pricing seems to be stabilizing and maybe turning a bit higher. DRAM, however, continues to be on a downward trend, just as you think about the current quarter how would you characterize what you're seeing from a component pricing environment perspective? Charles Liang : Yes, I mean, after many years improvement, our procurement department have been a much stronger than before ever. And also our economical scale help us to not only see NVMe especially SSD prices are getting growing and DRAM price continue slowly dropping. So both I guess about offset the next few months, I believe. Aaron Rakers : Okay, I'll slip one final one in that there's obviously some changes in the competitive landscape from a server CPU perspective, you mentioned in the trance in your prepared remarks, the progression with Rome or the second generation AMD processors. How would you characterize your ability to maybe leverage a bit of a changing competitive landscape in server CPUs what are you seeing in terms of the demand profile the appetite for AMD relative to server CPUs versus say Intel? Charles Liang : As I just say our AMD platform outperform the previous generation AMD solution allow more Qualcomm, almost double Qualcomm. So performance advantage which we had [indiscernible] so we feel pretty positive for AMD product line. As to Intel product line, again, our product line has been stronger than before ever. So we have good feeling for both Nvidia [ph]. Aaron Rakers : Okay, thank you. I'll leave the floor. Thanks a lot. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : It appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today and have a great day. See you next time. Bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal 2020 business update conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. Charles Liang,: Charles Liang : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last couple of years, the Super Micro has been continuing our journey of becoming a strong global leader of server and storage solutions. We have added many new product lines and roughly doubled our operational capacity worldwide to build our products more efficiently and with high quality. Now Super Micro is the most complete company it's ever been, supporting enterprise customers and data centers with optimized solutions, plus management software and services, and providing our industry-best system building blocks to the channel. \"Better, faster and greener\" is what our customers demand, and it's exactly what we deliver.  Today is also an important milestone of our company as it is our first quarter after relisting on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. We begin this new era for Super Micro, a stronger company with better financial and operational controls. Combined with the latest technology and total solutions for our customers, we are more optimistic than ever about our business opportunities ahead. I can confidently say that we are back, stronger and ready for growth.  Before we discuss this quarter's results, let me remind our shareholders about what makes Super Micro unique in our industry.  First, product innovation is our DNA. We are the only server and storage solutions provider with a majority of our engineering, product development and final assembly based in the USA. With over 1,700 engineering staff, mostly in the heart of Silicon Valley and some worldwide, our dedicated engineering strength allows us to quickly offer the most advanced technology with the broadest range of products in our industry.  We have capitalized on the industry convergence of cloud, artificial intelligence and 5G from data center to edge. These emerging technologies enable businesses and industries to utilize the growing pools of data and data analytics. Super Micro's technology innovation DNA uniquely positions us to provide timely and optimized solutions to service these key high-growth markets. We are delivering world-class solutions for global enterprises. From the private to the public cloud, our enterprise data center solutions have been widely deployed around the world. As a certified provider of enterprise solutions from leading software applications, such as SAP, Oracle, Red Hat to name a few, we offer complete, seamless solutions based on our hardware products, service and firmware/software design capabilities.  And finally, we are positioned to be one of the fastest-growing solution providers in the growing $100 billion server/storage market. Super Micro's growth strategy based on our building block solutions business model, which configures solutions directly to enterprise companies, data centers, OEMs and also indirectly through the channel. We plan to discuss our business opportunities and strategy in more detail with investors at events later this year.  Now turning to our Q2 results. Our second quarter net sales were $871 million, which exceeded the high end of our initial guidance and up 9% sequentially, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Sales were down 6.5% year-over-year, in large part, due to steep declines in component pricing.  Our indirect or channel business grew to represent 51% of this quarter's revenue and grew both sequentially and year-over-year. This quarterly result follows our successful launch of improved channel partner programs. At the same time, our direct and OEM businesses also grew sequentially, with the most of the growth coming from large enterprise accounts. Other than our current market focus, we are also enhancing our product offerings to hyperscale installations with highly optimized cloud DC and mega DC product lines.  Here are some key product highlights. We saw growth for our Rackmounts and multiple node product lines in data centers. This quarter, Rackmounts grew sequentially primarily due to a strong growth in our Ultra platform, which was up 30% sequentially, and BigTwin, which grew over 20% quarter-on-quarter. Ramping of AMD products and some other new Intel processor-based systems will help continue this strong momentum.  We saw sequential growth accelerated computing and launched multiple new GPU-based product offerings. Our customers choose Super Micro GPU solution over the competition because they provide the best pure performance with the fastest GPU interconnects and highest performance per dollar.  Our 5G, Embedded and IoT solution for edge computing, telco data center and appliance also grew, and we anticipate these product lines to grow significantly later this calendar year. We announced new additions for 5G cell tower deployments, leveraging fully configurable SuperServer to the edge, bringing standard x86 compute design to a traditional proprietary telco market. We also brought AI to the edge, combining ruggedized hardware and optimized software stacks to accelerate the most demanding AI workloads at the network edge.  We continue to focus on our mission to lead the IT industry with Green Computing Solutions and resource saving platforms, including the introduction of our first 12-year longevity power supply, a new part of the disaggregated architecture. With investor attention on ESG consideration, we anticipate increased demand for resource saving solutions.  Summarizing this quarter, we were pleased to see our revenue start to reaccelerate. We are also pleased to be able to move forward this quarter as a NASDAQ traded public company. We will continue to focus on transforming server and storage technologies by building upon our robust engineering fundamentals. Super Micro is ready to provide the best products to customers who are demanding innovation, quality, lower TCO and environmental-friendly solutions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. Our fiscal second quarter revenue was $871 million, exceeding the upper end of our prior guidance range. This reflects a 9% quarter-on-quarter increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2020 but a 6.5% decrease from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 77% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. However, ASPs for systems fell due to declines in commodity component costs.  Geographic performance was mixed on a challenging year-over-year comparison, with the U.S. up 3%, EMEA down 20%, and Asia 16% lower. On a sequential basis, the U.S. market continued to be our strongest market with sequential growth of 12%. However, this quarter, EMEA also grew sequentially, increasing by 12%. Asia had modest sequential growth with Taiwan, Korea and other Asia countries, offsetting weakness in China. Working down the P&L, our gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 15.9%, 210 basis points higher than last year driven by lower key component costs as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix.  Q2 operating expenses increased quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to higher employee costs, including higher R&D expense, targeting new opportunities. We had a strong central urgency to get current with our SEC filings by including the fiscal '18, '19\u2014and '19 10-K audit as well as the first quarter '20 10-Q review. We also completed a tax restructuring project on December 1, 2019, that results in a lower corporate tax rate of approximately 20% on a go-forward basis. Concluding these 3 projects increased G&A expense by approximately $6.4 million in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter of 2019. Other income and expense was a $1 million loss as compared to a $1 million gain last quarter, primarily related to the foreign exchange impact on our Taiwan dollar denominated term loan. Our tax rate for this quarter was 8% on a GAAP basis and 12% on a non-GAAP basis, both of which benefited from a release of reserves, following the conclusion of a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of $1.6 million.  Lastly, our share of earnings in a joint venture was a $1 million loss this quarter as compared to a $1 million gain in the previous quarter and a $1.8 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.57 per diluted share compared to $0.68 last quarter and $0.66 last year. Cash flow generated from operations totaled $82 million. After deducting for CapEx and investments of $11 million, we generated free cash flow of $71 million. And our closing cash position was $309 million.  This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 80 days, which is below our target of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 38 days. Days payable outstanding totaled 46 days, and inventory days was 87. In summary, we are pleased to see revenues reaccelerate. We are also pleased to be able to report this quarter as a NASDAQ traded public company with stronger financial controls.  Now turning to our outlook. The company expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, in a range of $770 million to $830 million. In addition to typically weaker seasonal trends, we are increasingly cautious given the unfolding impacts of the coronavirus outbreak. Barring further significant disruption from the outbreak, we expect this quarter to represent a trough and see constructive trends fueling healthy year-over-year growth going forward. In particular, we are encouraged by a healthy customer pipeline supported by a number of technology refreshes and product cycles in the second half of calendar 2020.  With regard to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in personnel to fuel growth. We are also aggressively remediating material weaknesses with the goal of full remediation by June 2020. Therefore, while OpEx will decline sequentially in the March quarter, it will grow sequentially in the June and September quarter due to the audit of our financials and testing of our remediation efforts. We expect audit and remediation costs to revert to normal levels after the September quarter.  We also announced that we expect to incur additional charges of $35 million to $40 million in the third or fourth fiscal quarter that are onetime in nature. These onetime charges address residual cleanup matters from our extended blackout period. We are taking actions to address benefits that were not be able to be realized by certain of our long-term and most dedicated key employees. Further, the Board is considering an additional retention bonus to certain employees. And lastly, our Board is considering appropriate forms of compensation for both of these matters. Regarding the use of cash through the rest of fiscal '20, we will apply cash to completing two buildings, one in San Jose and the other in Taiwan, which will be completed over two years. As I mentioned earlier, we expect higher than normal costs related to audit and remediation for several more quarters. Assuming this revenue range, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35 to $0.55 for the quarter. And as a reminder, these onetime charges are not included to non-GAAP EPS range. In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be attending Susquehanna's 9th Annual Technology Conference in New York City on March 12.  With that, I'll turn it back to Perry for Q&A. Perry Hayes : Thank you, Kevin. I'd just like to remind shareholders who are listening in on the call, I understand that the audio may not have been very clear. At this point, I'll remind you that the transcript will be available on our website, in fact, is at this time. So if you had any questions understanding part of it, please refer to the transcript.  Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will go to Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on continued progress forward. This could be for both Charles and Kevin. Just starting with the revenue trajectory, you guys\u2014there's two comments. Kevin, I believe you said Q-o-Q growth going forward, and then you also talked about, I think, in the second half of the year, a stronger R&D expense\u2014I'm paraphrasing here but you see revenue opportunities. And the guide for the March quarter, it was 7% to 8% at the midpoint. So could you talk about how you'd like us to think about sequential revenue kind of tempo and trajectory in the coming quarters to the extent that you're comfortable? Just so we can get a sense of that. And then what some of those upcoming revenue opportunities are? Kevin Bauer : As we highlighted this quarter, we have costs\u2014or caution a little bit with the coronavirus that is out there. What I tried to convey is that once we get through this quarter and say there are no residual effects of that, then we like what we see in terms of what our new customer pipeline looks like as well as knowing that the technology refreshes itself at the end of the year. And so we don't normally give a longer-term guidance, but just giving you a little bit of color for the investment community to results. Ananda Baruah : And that's the end of the calendar year? Kevin Bauer : Correct. Ananda Baruah : Got it. Great. And then just quickly on OpEx, if I could. You mentioned OpEx increasing in this\u2014there's actually a couple of moving parts you sampled for the OpEx. You actually\u2014magnitude of OpEx increasing. Well, you mentioned OpEx increasing in the second half of the year. Can you give us a sense, just for modeling purposes out of the gate year, how you'd like us to think about magnitude? And then I missed the part with regards to the audit costs. I think it's December quarter, it sounds like you're saying that normalizing. I just want to get a sense of what we\u2014how we should expect impact on\u2014when that rolls out as well or normalizes as well. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So let's first talk about our R&D investments. So we mentioned that we continue to invest in R&D for future products. Another [indiscernible] of the company is to enhance our software capabilities. So some of that is really focused on software engineers. And we are signalling that we continue to invest here.  As it relates to OpEx, I understand that certainly, as we really, really focused on getting compliance in this quarter, that $6.5 million is maybe not comprehended in model. And so therefore, I wanted to address that thing that, when we had our audited booking concurrently on both '18, '19 as well as first quarter '20, we went through a peak and that's why I tried to call that out. So that $6.4 million, I think it is safe to model that, that will not occur in the March quarter. And so kind of, to reset your base, I'll keep that in mind, and then I was trying to give you the ecology of the way audits play thereafter. So therefore, we're going to be dealing in a lot of remediation activity internally. And then as funded by\u2014we'll be working with the audit firm for [indiscernible] audit 2020 results as well as the intensity of their auditing our performance on internal control, hopefully, such that it would be remediated by 2020.  So that's the shape that I tried to give you, a reset, including into the March quarter, and then kind of like increasing through to September. Q - Ananda Baruah : I appreciate it, gentlemen. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of follow-ups. First one is for both Charles and Kevin. Commodity prices are on the rise, and your OpEx is also going to increase by June and September quarter. You're also talking about our revenue opportunities. So when I look at the trend, it seems like we shouldn't really expect any margin expansion until like a year from now or early 2021 given the commodity prices with GAAP, gross margin expansion and also increase in OpEx. Am I thinking that it's the right way? Or am I missing something? And I have a follow-up. Kevin Bauer : Well, I think we're always looking for ways to improve, but I think maybe the increase in commodity prices, as a margin percentage, I think I articulated that, that could be a little bit of a headwind. So I think you're on track there. Charles Liang : [indiscernible] quarter, maybe two years ago. We start with investing much more in Korea. So Super Micro [indiscernible] provide most of total solution through our enterprise customer. And unlike 10 years ago, we pretty [indiscernible]. So we can [indiscernible] as a total solution company. And this [indiscernible] we are adding more value to our product. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. And that's actually a good point. And it leads to my second question, just for Charles. It's good that you're not currently [indiscernible] NASDAQ, and there's significant growth opportunity. And hopefully, we get the margin expansion like this year and next year. But can you share with us, Charles, what are you doing to improve governance? What are you doing so that as you grow the business? There's also checks and balances that would help with increased confidence and\u2014so that we could look forward and the path would be just a rear view? Charles Liang : Yes. That is why we are saying\u2014I mean, in [indiscernible] we start to invest more and more in the firmware, software solutions. So we are ready to focus much more on the enterprise, including governance and some other mission-critical patent. So from this point of view, we feel very comfortable to grow our [indiscernible] both in OEM and in [indiscernible]. Q - Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. That's well understood. But what are the key checks and balances that you put in place? So as you grow, there's also a more systematic approach in scaling the business so that the top line and bottom line are consistent. Charles Liang : Kevin, [indiscernible]. Kevin Bauer : Yes. Sure. So maybe, I think I can share with you that Charles has been very, very forward and very supportive in terms of investing in the feed and ensuring that, for instance, the internal audit and the compliance group are all joined at the hip. And I will tell you that now with Don at the helm at sales and Alex being our COO, the communication of\u2014in training across the entire organization is light years ahead of what it was a year or two ago. And to give you a little bit of color, I think, just this quarter, we were very enhanced in terms of the way that we closed this quarter and being very interactive with the operational people to understand everything that's going on to make sure that we are fully aware of what impacts the financials. And so Charles certainly helps us make sure that we have all the resources to be able to do that. As you know, we have other remediation efforts that we need to attend to. We brought on a wonderful [indiscernible] chair that has helped us in terms of helping to get and understand ideas of how an apps deal company needs to perform revenue on a daily basis as well as follow up with requisite investments in IT. So there's a lot going on in the ecosystem [indiscernible]. Charles Liang : Yes. Especially the SAP system has been much mature than two years ago or three years ago. And we're now adding operational [indiscernible]. I would have to say, we pretty much double our [indiscernible] in compliance and financial department compared with two years ago. So all of those kind of dramatically improved our operations and financial function. Q - Mehdi Hosseini : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Then we'll move on to our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Q - Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the questions. Also congratulations on being out on the results. And so kind of building on Mehdi's question. I'm just curious, I heard the comment in the prepared remarks about positive views on the pipeline of opportunities looking through the course of this year. And I guess the simple question of that is, kind of how would you define pipeline? How has the methodology around looking at the pipeline changed? And then again, what is pipeline to you guys given, obviously, the nature of your business, it's fairly turns-oriented? I'm just curious of how you\u2014what underlies the comment as we look forward, and I do have a follow-up. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So I think it's probably pretty traditional in that the pipeline that I was referring to was really the targeted customers that we're trying to obtain and understanding that\u2014what is in front of us and the level of efforts that we find to land new customers. So sometimes pipeline is referred to growing backlog and all those kind of things, which is not our business. What we're talking about is landing new customers. Charles Liang : Especially [indiscernible], we start to have a more enterprise accounts. So those enterprise and large accounts in the area continues by the products and commerce distribution and regular data center. They change vendor kind of more [indiscernible]. Q - Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then the follow-up question is kind of tied to the pipeline commentary, is that as you move through the course of 2020, there seems to be a little bit of a different cadence to kind of server cycle dynamics. And it's particularly around the cadence of Intel's product cycles, what that means for your business. So how do you see\u2014there's a lot of discussion out there around Cascade Lake and the ramp of that going to Cooper Lake, and whether or not there could be any kind of delays on Icelake. How do you see the cadence of kind of the server CPU cycle through the course of this year? And how relevant has AMD as compared [indiscernible] in the context of your business? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean obviously, AMD is growing quickly, and NPLs are more dynamic new product. So basically\u2014by the way, when they have new technology, new generation products always outperform the older product. So we have a very strong engineering team and fully focused on delivering the new economies in the market. So taking AMD alone [indiscernible], we are well prepared. And that's why we believe [indiscernible] on this calendar year and next year, I believe we will have a big chance to build much faster. Q - Aaron Rakers : And just to slip in one other question. How quickly can you pass-through your upward pricing on the component front? Charles Liang : Your question again? Q - Aaron Rakers : How\u2014as we look at component pricing potentially moving higher, I guess, particularly around DRAM, as we move through the course of this year, how do I think about your guys' ability to pass through pricing on the way up? And obviously, it's had an impact on ASPs on the way down. But as pricing comes back, how quickly do I think in your business model, you pass that back through from a pricing perspective? Charles Liang : Okay. Basically, we have a much stronger relationship with our vendor already. And so pretty much, we are able to be deflect any price to our customers. So that overall effect should be [indiscernible]. Kevin Bauer : You're trying to understand the delay, and I think there is always a delay, but we try to be very nimble in that. And we [indiscernible]. Q - Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you. Please go ahead. Operator : Thank you. And then move on to our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Congratulations on a really strong cash from operations quarter. Looks like the drivers were across the board in terms of cash conversion cycle. Should\u2014is this now at a level where you expect it to be? Or did you guys actually over-index a little bit on the construction of the cash conversion cycle? Kevin Bauer : Yes, I think we had a good quarter. And I did refer to fact that it was better than what our near-term target range was. I\u2014like every watermark, I'm not sure it will be there because\u2014forever because we have seasonalities that we have to live with. But I think what we'll do now is kind of revisit our target. And over the course of time to be\u2014that project can be shifted, so a little bit better performance, and we'll give an update on that. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And I apologize if this has been asked earlier, I am having trouble hearing you guys clearly. But did you guys give any metrics on the large enterprise customer segment? Kevin Bauer : No, we did not. We broke it down basically, in terms of our direct and our indirect channel. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. I've got a couple more questions. On the performance within the quarter, obviously, you guys did\u2014came in just above the high end of your guidance. So that's great to see. What do you think was the delta rolls with your performance? Do you think it was the industry perform better? Or you guys performed better than what you had expected? And then relative to the prior few quarters, Super Micro revenue year-over-year growth had been underperforming the industry. Do you have a sense as far as how you guys did perform relative to the industry for the December quarter? Charles Liang : Yes. We see the\u2014before, we always grew much faster than the industry. [indiscernible] see a slow down. Now it's time to get back to faster growth again. So we expect that we will be able to grow a better [indiscernible]. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Is that what's embedded in the March Q guidance? Kevin Bauer : I'm sorry, your question was a little muffled. Can you repeat it? Q - Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Charles mentioned that expect to grow faster than the industry going forward. Now, is that embedded in the March Q guidance? Kevin Bauer : I mean, March is a very difficult quarter. I think we're talking about beyond the March quarter, just given all of the macro dynamics that we talked about. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Good. And then could you comment particularly on\u2014you did mention that geographic performance was uneven, but what was the reason behind that? Was that industry or Super Micro specific? Kevin Bauer : I think\u2014we haven't seen everyone else in the industry breakout. We haven't compared it necessarily. But in Europe, I think we will go soft from data center customers. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jonathan Lopez : Thanks so much .I have three. I hope you can bear with me. The first one, the deferred revenue continues to grow a lot, and it's like comfortably over $200 million. Can you just remind us like what's driving that? And then does that yield you any different or better visibility looking forward than was the case before the deferred balance really starting to come up? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So I think first and foremost, it's good that we're starting to get stronger service business. Certainly, when you're attacking enterprise customers who want that white glove performance or rather expectations, that helped do that. So it is a little bit of a proxy build out. There's a lot when we add on in that deferred service revenue in terms of the length of contracts that people are signing up for. Also pricing over the course of time ends up being in the service revenue line item as well. But I think you're right in terms of it growing is a healthy thing for Super Micro. And what I said in past calls is that, so far, it is a small number from a revenue perspective, but it hopefully will be giving us some buffer in the margin area as time goes by.  So it's all just a big direct from appliances for Super Micro, and is a proof point to a certain degree, of the increase in software and service profit for the company that Charles outlined earlier. Charles Liang : Yes. And at this stage, we started to service [indiscernible] more than 15% here. So we believe the trend will continue for next many years to come. Q - Jonathan Lopez : All right. Great. That's helpful. My second one, if we just look at the December quarter, I don't have the exact numbers here, but if I kind of ballpark your commentary, it looks like the nonservice systems business, that's subsystems and accessories segment, was up a lot. A, drive that right. And b, like what was driving that to kind of a disproportionately high level of growth relative to service systems? Perry Hayes : So yes, this indirect channel was higher than what we've typically seen. I just want to call out, though, that both the direct and OEM business and the indirect channel business both grew sequentially. The indirect channel, we've had a number of programs that we've launched in support of the channel. That, I think, has been helpful. Also, we've seen that the channel also includes the logistic part where we sell subsystems, but it also includes bars we have some larger customers buying systems from them. So that's primarily what we sell, larger purchases through the indirect channel from some of our larger customers. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So I think the key thing there that Perry kind of broke out a little bit is that one cannot make a direct connection to systems versus subsystems and channel versus direct. It is quite a bit of a mix in there. Q - Jonathan Lopez : That makes sense. Just thinking about the March, I'm not looking for segment guidance, but would you expect that growth rate to kind of normalize between the two segments looking into March? Perry Hayes : I think we'll see contribution from those probably in the same degree. Kevin Bauer : Yes. That would be a sequential comment. We might see the same kind of mix shift when we compare year-over-year, however. Q - Jonathan Lopez : Okay. Got you. The last one, I'm hoping to come back to the OpEx real quick because there's a lot of moving pieces here, but if I could just ask it this way. The March quarter, it looks like you're guiding us to something in like the high 80s on a non-GAAP basis. From there, what level of increase should we expect for the balance of the year? And is there just\u2014I'm trying to pause so we see it qualitatively. Is there a scenario where OpEx actually declines from the calendar third to the calendar fourth as some of these onetime things move to completion? Kevin Bauer : Well, I'm glad you asked that question because you've misinterpreted what I said. We had OpEx and non-GAAP OpEx in the quarter be a little over $100 million, right? And so what I tried to say is that $6.5 million will [indiscernible] what we will come off for the March quarter. So strip off $6.5 million. And then from that new baseline, we would have some trending upward expense than that. So you already asked that one. Q - Jonathan Lopez : Okay. And sorry, just the last part of that, is there\u2014are you guys embedding some kind of like interim peak here in the middle to late part of the second, third quarter that then declines into the fourth? Or we'll just continue to ramp through the year? Kevin Bauer : So it'll be continuing to ramp. And then actually first quarter '21, I think, would be a peak from an audit cost perspective. Q - Jonathan Lopez : First quarter calendar '21? Kevin Bauer : Yes. That's when the bulk of the work of the audit is done on June the 5th. Q - Jonathan Lopez : Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Once again if you would like to ask a question that is star, one. We'll take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Kevin Bauer : So I just want to [indiscernible] that I was speaking in fiscal quarter near the ending. 1Q '21 would be September of 2020. Q - Ananda Baruah : Cool. And Kevin, just sort of sticking with that theme. This is a\u2014more of a\u2014definitely calendar '21\u2014calendar\u2014sort of calendar '21 going to calendar '22 question. More philosophically about how we should think of\u2014how you would like to think about business model evolution, one, what sort of all the audit costs have rolled off? And you have these new programs running. And how would you like us to think about the sort of op margin, not guidance, but sort of leveraging the model, how you guys are thinking about anecdotally and philosophically funding\u2014funding new programs, it sounds like you have at least a handful of things you're pretty excited about right now. What's the right way for us to think about as we think about calendar '21 and moving towards normalized in different [indiscernible]? Kevin Bauer : Yes. It's a little bit mature\u2014premature for us to be able to call that out right now. In our interactions in the past quarter or so, we've mentioned that now that we're back on the market, but we might take a little bit of time redescribing the company and preparing for an Analyst Day in which we would then present a model going forward. So I'm not quite ready to answer that question, please. Q - Ananda Baruah : Okay. Got it. Are you\u2014have you guys guided upon doing an Analyst Day at some point this year? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We've kind of said late spring, early summer. Q - Ananda Baruah : Okay. Kevin Bauer : And we would do it\u2014we would do so in New York. Q - Ananda Baruah : Excellent. I often look forward to it. Charles Liang : As you may know, right? I mean, from [indiscernible] last year, previous, we see a Super Micro [indiscernible] and extend our business through a total solution, not like the five years ago from the [indiscernible] hardware company. So now we are moving to not just hardware company, but total solution, including firmware, software and service. So there, we're putting more value to our business. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. On your last slide of your presentation deck, you have 3.0 solutions, management software and then global services and support that's been driving us for the past three years. What is the level of your global service and support personnel to date? Charles Liang : Our global support team is getting stronger, too. Kind of\u2014it's not like\u2014in terms of hardware, we feel we are more completed system, higher value, even improving our security management feature and kind of the whole cloud in those pipeline. And other than that, we started overall inside the [indiscernible] in some other [indiscernible]. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Could you give any commentary as far as how large is the global support staff at this point in time? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We don't have that number on our fingertips. But what I can tell you is there are some reasons that we work with partners through our offices as well. So our strategy has been work with partners in new markets and then [indiscernible] where we have scale, so to speak. So I think [indiscernible] next time. I think they're providing that there's going to be [indiscernible] becomes more meaningful for the company. Q - Nehal Chokshi : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and have a great one. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Did you not hear the intro? James Kisner : No, we did not. Good afternoon and thank you for attending to Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which ended March 31, 2020. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events and Presentations tab. We have also published management's scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these items are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released financial results for our fiscal third quarter 2020. Now let's take a look at a few highlights from our Q3 results. Our third quarter net sales totaled $772 million, up 4% year-over-year. Our Q3 earnings per share was $0.84 compared to $0.49 last year, which was up 71% year-over-year. One area of particular strength in the quarter was our 5G, Edge and IoT products, which were up more than 30% year-over-year. Before we dive into the financial details, I want to provide you an update on our business vision. To make it simple, our business strategy is to build the best products for high-growing markets, leveraging our unique building-block-solutions design approach and green computing, resource-saving architecture that's beneficial to both our customers and the environment. We have been focusing on our strategic high-growth market segments and aligning our resource accordingly to speed up growth for the coming quarters and years. These 4 strategic drivers are : first, our organic enterprise and channel business, including server, storage and AI, which are our long historical growth areas; second, the new 5G, Edge and telco business; third, large data center and public cloud; and fourth, software and global services. In the enterprise space, we have acquired many brand-name enterprise customers over the years, and our plan is to win more new accounts while growing our installed base. To that end, we have our key products such as BigTwin, Ultra and MP systems, certified by leading enterprise software partners such as SAP, Oracle, VMware and Red Hat. As an important part of our organic growth, our channel business has remained strong throughout the year due largely to our building-block-solutions approach that helps our partners create the most optimized systems for their customers. In the rapidly growing AI and machine learning space, we have established ourselves as a premier AI system provider. We have recently introduced the industry's broadest portfolio of validated NVIDIA GPU Cloud or NGC-Ready systems, optimized to accelerate AI and deep learning applications. We see more AI workload moving towards the edge, where AI inferencing and 5G in the converging and driving up demand for our intelligent edge products. Our second growth driver is 5G, Edge and telco, which represent an exciting field of opportunities for Supermicro. We have designed a series of new telco and Edge-friendly product lines to help our customers build out their 5G deployments, which enable them to transform their existing proprietary hardware infrastructure to open, software-defined x86 standard hardware from Supermicro. For example, our pole-mounted, ruggedized IP65 level is perfect for 5G and outdoor intelligent edge. We also introduced an optimized short-depth 2U Ultra SuperServer that provides better features and faster performance and is ideal for telco and micro data center environments. Just yesterday, we host a highly successful online event with our technology partner, Intel. The 5G live forum brought together leading infrastructure and telco companies from globe to discuss the latest total solutions for 5G. These sessions are now available on our website. We believe the transition from 4G to 5G will provide Supermicro significant growth opportunities going forward. The third growth driver we are focusing now is the large data center and public cloud space. Our new products such as the Cloud DC systems are purpose-built for hyperscale data centers with cost optimization and ease of volume deployment. In preparation to scale for more cloud business, we have already made available 30% extra production and service capacity as of today and are also expanding our global manufacturing facilities, especially in Taipei, where lower operating costs allow us to be more competitive. The last and fourth growth driver is our software and global service. To ensure our server, storage and networking products are simple to deploy, easy to manage and secure to use, we have been investing in our software and global service over the past many years. In addition, we have certified all the major operating systems and key applications while adding more security capabilities. As more and more customers are deploying data centers at an increasingly large scale, it's paramount that we supply them with more capable cloud-scale management software that enable streamlined and fully automatic data center operations. An enhanced mix of hardware, software and services revenue will also improve our gross margin over time and provide revenue growth. In summary, we were pleased with our quarterly results despite the disruption caused by COVID-19. And at this moment, we do not plan to provide the quarterly revenue guidance. But we are very excited with our innovative product pipeline and our new growth drivers, which Supermicro reaccelerate our revenue growth and resume our long history of market share gain. I will now hand the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First, I would like to thank our employees, customers, investors and partners for their support as we navigate the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon the news of the outbreak overseas, our first response was to actively manage our supply chain for potential shortage risk by increasing inventories of critical components. Since that time, we have continued to add to our safety stock for key components such as CPUs, memory, SSDs and, to a lesser extent, GPUs, such that customer orders can be fulfilled as they are received. As a designated essential business, we responded to the directives of Santa Clara County and the state of California regarding shelter-in-place instructions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Our first priority is the safety of our workforce, and we immediately began to implement numerous health precautions and work practices to operate in a safe manner. Operating in the critical sector of IT infrastructure, we assessed our customer base to identify priority customers who also operate in critical industries, guiding us in our go-forward strategy. We quickly transitioned most of our indirect labor force to work from home. We also shifted some focus towards Taiwan operations from Europe and the United States. Despite this disruption, we successfully managed the last 2 weeks of March to achieve revenues at the bottom of our original guidance range. Now let me turn to the financials. Our fiscal third quarter revenue totaled $772 million, which was at the lower end of our initial guidance range given on February 6 and above the midpoint of the guidance range we gave on April 2. This reflects an 11% quarter-on-quarter decrease from the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 but a 4% increase from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 74% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were down sequentially but up year-over-year. A number of large enterprise customers fulfilled data center projects in the December quarter and, is often the case, paused in the March quarter. ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter but declined year-over-year. Geographic performance on a year-over-year basis was mixed with the U.S. down 3%, EMEA up 20% and Asia 10% higher. On a sequential basis, the U.S. market declined 20%, while EMEA grew sequentially by 9%. Asia declined a modest 3% sequentially. There were a number of sizable discrete events in the quarter that I would like to emphasize. First, we received a settlement fee on a joint product development project for $10.1 million, $0.6 million of which reduced cost of sales and $9.5 million that reduced R&D expense. Applying our U.S. tax rate of 23% would yield a $0.14 benefit to diluted earnings per share on both our GAAP and non GAAP financials. Second, in our last call, we mentioned that we expected to incur additional onetime charges of $35 million to $40 million related to residual cleanup matters from our extended blackout period. By direction of our Board of Directors, we saw input on this matter from investors holding approximately 45% of our shares outstanding and incorporated that input to provide cash awards, many of which included performance conditions. This quarter, we recorded $10.3 million in expense, $2.9 million of which increased cost of sales and $7.4 million that increased operating expense related to the awards. As noted in our last call, we have excluded this item from our non-GAAP measures. Lastly, we recorded a provision for an SEC settlement of $17.5 million that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Working down the P&L. Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 17.7%, 250 basis points higher than last year driven by lower commodity costs as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix and the aforementioned settlement fee. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter to $118 million mainly due to a $12.5 million increase in salaries and benefits, including previously disclosed performance awards and the related payroll tax withholding and the $17.5 million provision for an SEC settlement. These expenses were offset by $9.5 million related to the joint product development related settlement fee. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 15% quarter-on-quarter and increased 8% year-on-year to $87 million. The sequential decline was due to several factors, including lower audit costs and lower employee costs, including R&D expenses and the joint product development related settlement fee. Recall that concluding in our delinquent filings in the December quarter led to a sequential reduction of audit fees of approximately $6.5 million. Other income and expense was a $0.9 million gain as compared to a $0.4 million loss last quarter primarily related to the foreign exchange impact on our Taiwan dollar-denominated term loan. This quarter, our taxes were a $0.9 million benefit on a GAAP basis and a $2.9 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, we benefited from reduced tax liabilities in the U.S. and the Netherlands. We continue to expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate going forward to be approximately 20%. Lastly, our share results in the joint venture was a $1.1 million loss this quarter as compared to a $1 million loss in the previous quarter and a $0.4 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.84 per diluted share compared to $0.57 last quarter and $0.49 last year. Cash used in operations totaled $21 million, as we invested in inventory as a defensive measure. And CapEx totaled $11 million, resulting in free cash outflow of $32 million. Our closing cash position, including restricted cash, was $319 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 92 days, which is slightly above our target of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 41 days. Days payable outstanding totaled 61 days, and inventory days was 112. Now turning to the outlook for our business. Given the uncertainties of COVID-19, we will not be providing guidance for the coming quarter. However, to provide context around our business, we are sharing the following metrics and facts. We continue to see ongoing demand as we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and do not have significant direct exposure to industries such as retail, oil and gas and travel and leisure that have been impacted the greatest. As time passes, we may discover greater indirect exposure to distressed industries through our channel partners and OEM customers. We note that our shipments plus orders shippable in the June quarter as of the last week are up as compared to the prior quarter and are also up compared to the same quarter a year ago as well. Looking forward, logistics has emerged as a new challenge as the transportation industry restricts the frequency of departures and increases costs. We expect increased costs in freight as well as direct labor costs as we incentivize our employees to continue to work and assist us in serving our customers, many of whom are in critical industries. We expect these incremental costs to reduce gross margin by 100 to 150 basis points on a sequential basis. We also expect to record expense of $16 million to $17 million related to the aforementioned performance awards in the June 2020 quarter. Approximately $20 million to $25 million in cash will be paid in June 2020 quarter related to these performance awards. Our management team is focused on guiding our company through the unfolding and emerging challenges presented by COVID-19. Although we're unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 may further impact our business operations, financial performance and result of operations, we believe we are well positioned financially and strategically in an uncertain business environment. With that, I'll turn it back to James for Q&A. James Kisner : Operator, we're ready to open the queue for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Two items. One, on the P&L and revenue mix, can you provide some color on how the mix between server system and subsystem was in the March quarter and how you see it trending into the June quarter? And then on the inventories that went up by about $160 million, are you going to continue to build inventory in the June quarter? I mean, to that extent, how should I think about cash from operation and free cash flow? Kevin Bauer : Yes. Mehdi, thanks for the questions. So I think the first one, in terms of systems versus subsystems, we talked a little bit about how sequentially we had some good systems purchases by enterprise customers that were project-related in the fourth quarter. Oftentimes, we get that in the December quarter and the June quarter, and those were down quarter-over-quarter. So that's primarily one of the drivers of systems being down. And then to your second question, as it relates to inventory, yes, we did build quite a bit of inventory during the quarter, as I had described, trying to get ahead of the ball game in terms of any supply issues that were out there. We will potentially continue to build inventories during the course of this quarter. I think it all depends on what we bought and then the success of our sales coming out in this quarter as well, but still in a defensive posture until we feel a little bit more comfortable about seeing the supply situation in terms of lead times coming down a little bit and then feeling a little bit better about not being bit by any logistic issues. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. Just a quick follow-up. In your prepaid remarks, you said you did indeed accumulate more inventory of CPU and I think you said the storage, or you may have said DRAM and SSDs. But you said not as much GPU. How should I think about the mix of inventory that you're accumulating, why less GPU and more CPU? Charles Liang : Yes. As you may know, I mean, memory and SSD has been shortage in the market for few quarters, especially recently. That's why we shipped more memory -- I mean SSD. As to CPU and GPU, we manage relatively very well. Yes, June quarter, you already have a kind of high season. That's why we prepare a little bit more to make sure we won't have a shortage to our customer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Just kind of building on that last question. I'm just curious, I guess, first of all, on the constraint side, were you unable to ship to any customer demand this last quarter because of supply constraints or component constraints? And then on that same topic, how are you currently seeing the pricing environment? As you build inventory, there's a little bit of a debate out there whether or not memory pricing could start to turn the other direction, meaning decline going into the back half of the year. I'm just curious on what are you seeing in terms of flash pricing as well as DRAM pricing in your inventory? Kevin Bauer : Well, I'll take the first question, and then I'll let Charles speak to the second question. As it relates to the first question, Aaron, we always exit the quarter with some portion of our demand not being able to be shipped because of shortages. That was true this quarter as well. Charles Liang : Yes. And that's why we are watching very carefully. It's a daily base, and then we keep kind of enough SSD and DRAM as of this moment. So I believe our inventory level today should be pretty efficient to support our June quarter demand. And as for the pricing, I mean, it's hard to say. It depends on the coronavirus situation, right? At this moment, looks like it's still kind of not predictable, but we kind of keep relatively in a very high confidence level, a little bit higher inventory, but we believe we need them either this quarter or in the next few months. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then just kind of thinking about -- you talked about kind of the growth drivers, the vertical kind of market opportunities that you guys have between AI, ML and enterprise, Cloud, 5G, Edge, telco and then software and services. Is there -- can you help us understand the contributions of those, call it, 4 verticals to the business today? And any thoughts on what you're expecting those to kind of grow as we move forward? Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you for the question. As you know, we just finished the 10K today, kind of a long-term program. So now we are recovering -- I mean recovering in our business, get back to a normal faster growth mode like we had in last 25 years. So I mean, other than our organic enterprise, service, storage and channel business, we are ready to fully focus on our 5G, Edge and telco market as well. So we have a dedicated team focused in that area and believe it will start to grow strongly. And the other area, kind of like a large data center and public cloud, yes, before our capacity was limited, especially in U.S.A.. And in the last few years, we extend our capacity pretty successfully in Taipei. So now we have an extra capacity in Taipei, and we believe it's beneficial to ourselves, our shareholders, to focus on large-scale cloud and to grow our economic scale. And we will be selective to grow that deal and make sure it's a positive for company. As to software and global service, I believe we shared a couple of times in our quarter end conference call, and it's continued stably growing business. With software, especially management software and our fully efficient global service, we are able to approach more enterprise customer, cloud -- private cloud and public cloud around the world. So we feel pretty comfortable to recover our faster growth business model now. Kevin Bauer : Yes. I think, Aaron, that's another area that we hope to be a little bit more discrete about in Analyst Day. Charles Liang : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : A couple, if I could. Charles, Kevin, congratulations on the crisp execution as well. Yes, two, if I could. I guess the first is -- and I apologize if you've already spoken to this and I missed it. But Charles, in the press release, you talked about how key application adoption, I think you say all of which is accelerating as a result of COVID, and I was wondering if you could talk with a little more context as to what you're seeing there with regards to acceleration. And it sounds like you guys are leasing some good follow-through, so would love to get some context around sort of what types of applications you're seeing accelerated. You think maybe there could be some bit of a structural change, not just a little pull-forward and any other context you think that would be useful for us. And then I have a quick follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you. Very good question. The coronavirus indeed created a big trouble for people around the world, but it also created some strong demand for people. For example, people work for home and people stay at home, so they need a lot of networking service. So we saw a large data center communication company and other security-related organization, their demand indeed increasing kind of strongly. So good part is we have been preparing 5G, Edge and telco business since about last year. So those products are getting mature. And we gained -- getting ever more customer commit to those product. So I mean, overall, I feel optimistic for our future growth, although it has to be very carefully watched, the coronavirus. As of this moment, I feel basically positive. Ananda Baruah : That's great. And it may be too early to ask this next question. But are you able to develop any sort of opinion on if there's going to be any degree of structural change in customer -- not consumer, your customer behavior such that maybe the level of dollar spend on those types of applications you benefit from could remain elevated given everything that's taken place? I know it's early, and I know there's a lot of opinions about that. But if you feel like you've been able to develop on that, I'd love to hear what it is. Charles Liang : Yes. As you may know, our building-blocks solution have been helping us a lot with a lot of customer-specific application or some modification to optimize their data center structure. We are able to modify from our existing building block solution. Instead of a completely new design that may take people 1 year or 6 months, in most of our case, it took us a much shorter time frame, 2 months to 3 months. We are able to optimize exactly the application customer want, so including 5G, Edge and telco market, I just mentioned. So a lot of that, we are able to quickly win on some good commitment from certain really large-scale customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical GRP. Jon Lopez : So my first question is, would you mind just walking through stepping back the time line or a time frame from sort of February through now? And I guess what I'm looking at or trying to get a sense for is, I'm assuming things were pretty challenging for a bit there. But I'm wondering if you could describe how the quarter ended and just how things have trended thus far as you've got into calendar Q2. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So I kind of shared that we -- first of all, the March quarter is always a difficult quarter because of the fact that you have Lunar New Year there. So typically, what we see is that it's pretty slow in the first 2 months and then we try to predict what the third month was. This year was no different than any other. And as we guide into the March quarter -- I'm sorry, in the month of March, things turned around. We saw a solid line of sight to be able to hit the bottom of range that we were at. We were able to navigate the last two weeks as it relates to the disruptions of the workforce. And because of that, we're -- unlike others, at that time, we did not just pull guidance. We decided to wait and be able to give a new guidance in the first week of April. Thereafter, as I've said, we've seen continuing demand as compared to our metrics. So backlog plus shipped were a little bit ahead as compared to quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. But the visibility is still very murky out there with COVID-19. We don't know the rate of people going back to work or anything like that. It's still fuzzy. Jon Lopez : Right. No, that's helpful. But I guess the thing I'm driving at is that your fiscal Q4, and to your point, we all understand, these are not normal times, but I would imagine your backlog would be building or would be higher in a normal fiscal Q4. So I guess the thing I'm just kind of driving at, if you could compare to what would be normal, are things more or less back to normal at this point, caveated around the lack of visibility and all that stuff? Kevin Bauer : On a year-over-year basis, it is up, that's what I said, in terms of our backlog and shipments as of this time. Jon Lopez : Yes. Okay. Got you. Helpful. My second question, and I apologize, you may have covered some of this stuff. I was on hold for a bit. But relative to the backlog and the shippable stuff, are there anything -- other like -- and I know you highlighted logistics, but like are there things that would prevent you from shipping that backlog? And is that like part of the reason that you're -- despite having that maybe cautious or opting not to offer guidance, like could backlog be there but you would not be able to meet it for one reason or another? Kevin Bauer : There are a number of reasons, some of which is that, at this time, especially over the last few weeks, we've had to confirm that our customers are able to receive the products, having people work on the dock to receive it. So we can't just ship product to them and have it left on their dock with no attention there. So there's a number of things like that, that are little practical items that we need to go through in greater pain than under normal times. Jon Lopez : Yes. That makes sense. I got 2 other real quick ones, if you could bear with me. The first one, just on gross margins, you mentioned that you're going to see some headwinds cost-wise from logistics. And I think you quantified that. It's like 150, 200 basis points relative to calendar Q1. Is there anything else that we should think about gross margin-wise between calendar Q1 and calendar Q2 other than those logistical headwinds in costs? Kevin Bauer : Well, yes, we had a pretty good product mix in that quarter. So we'll see what the product mix is when we get done in the second calendar quarter as well. Jon, now that you're on the phone, I'm going to answer a question that you're not asking because I got nudged by someone here. And that is that I wanted to highlight that in my prepared remarks, I said that our going-forward tax rate is 20%. That's our long-term going-forward tax rate, which we're still believing will apply to 2021. But obviously, we had some favorable tax treatments in the March quarter. And for this year, we expect that because of the fact that we -- our employees can now trade their options and sell shares. We're starting to get some stock comp windfall. And also, we've been able to conclude on some old tax audits. So for this year, we think the GAAP tax rate for the full year is going to be more like in the mid-teens on a GAAP basis and maybe as low as 10% on a non-GAAP basis. So I wanted to clarify that because... Jon Lopez : No, that was on my list. That was on my list. I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you did it. The last one, to get rid of me, the -- I understand not giving revenue guidance. I guess, the one thing I'm hoping you could talk to a little bit, I mean, you can control OpEx much more readily than you can control revenue. So I know there was a lot of onetime-y stuff in calendar Q1. But as you think about the balance of the year, can you just talk through how even qualitatively you're planning on handling OpEx until visibility improves a bit? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So we will be continuing to invest. As Charles had outlined, we're still moving to be able to grow, more so in Taiwan than others, but trying to be careful and trying to be smart as the economy reveals itself. Jon Lopez : Okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't expect OpEx to come down a whole lot. Is that a fair way to summarize that? Kevin Bauer : Yes. Operator : [Operator instructions] We have a follow-up from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Just a couple of follow-ups. As a follow-up to the prior question regarding OpEx, Kevin, you mentioned a couple of items in your prepared remarks like a higher equity, share -- equity compensation and cash award. Can you please just highlight those items? Are those all going to be in the COGS? Or how is it split between COGS and OpEx? And beyond the June quarter, how does the OpEx look like when these onetime increase go away? And I have a follow-up. Kevin Bauer : Yes. Sure. So Mehdi, I'll step back and highlight the fact that we said that we reached out to roughly about shareholders that held about 45% of our shares to be able to craft these things. And so these are cash awards. But because of the fact that most of them have performance conditions, we have to use a Monte Carlo analysis to determine how to spread the expense over time. I think I mentioned that we had roughly about $10 million in expense this quarter. And in the next quarter, I think I said it was about $16 million to $17 million. And then there's going to be -- after that, I would expect that it's going to come down dramatically, and there will be a tail over the course of time that would be far less material as it goes. So that's the way that the expense would be spread. And then I highlighted the fact that there will be payments that will hit our cash balance in this June, as some of those conditions have been successfully met. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And two follow-ups here. The tailwind, as we look into the second half calendar year, does that imply like a single digit, like a $5 million-ish per quarter? Would that be a fair assumption for modeling purposes? Kevin Bauer : Are you talking about OpEx growth? Mehdi Hosseini : No, I'm talking about the compensation. The employee compensation in the March quarter was $10 million and then $16 million to $17 million in June, and then it's going to come down. You said there is a tailwind. And for purpose of modeling, should I assume that tailwind is like a mid-single in September quarter and beyond? Kevin Bauer : I'm sorry. I think I've misdescribed it for you. So what I said was, is -- let me just make sure here, let me go back and refer to what I said here. Mehdi Hosseini : I think you said $16 million to $17 million in June. And for March, it was $10 million. Kevin Bauer : Right. So that's about $26 million or so. And if you remember, we had estimated it to be about $35 million to $40 million. It's going to be -- in the end, it's going to be maybe not quite $35 million. Does that help you? Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. And then I also want to go back to my earlier question. I was trying to figure out how the server system business tracked in the March quarter. And what should we expect in the June quarter? I didn't quite understand if it was up or down in March. Kevin Bauer : Sorry, can you say that again? Mehdi Hosseini : Was the server system revenue -- total revenue minus subsystem, was it flat, up or down in the March quarter? Kevin Bauer : It was down, Mehdi. And I explained that it was driven by enterprise customers who executed on capacity projects in the fourth quarter, took a pause in the March quarter. And what I said was that by looking at what they're doing in the June quarter, they're coming back a little bit. Also, on that cash award comp, remember, we're not GAAP-ing that out. Don't forget that. Mehdi Hosseini : Right. Sure. Okay. And I just want to go back to -- so you did increase inventory by $100-some million, and then June is typically your strongest quarter. Some of the server system that could not be shipped in March is pushed out to June. So when I look at these dynamics, it seems like your inventory should start to come down in the second half of calendar year and some -- as the supply disruption goes away. Would you agree or not? Charles Liang : Basically, yes. Kevin Bauer : That's right. Charles Liang : Yes. Unless in second half, coronavirus global situation really improve, and we hope so, and then our inventory had to grow again to meet the growth. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : I appreciate the follow-up. Just quickly another -- it's not really a clarification but just more context again. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned public cloud and some of the things you're doing around public cloud. You mentioned it a couple of times. There's also a mention of cloud in the press release. So is there -- are you -- is there something sort of new that's going on there? It sounds like you sort of teased it out. So I would love to understand -- well, how should we -- how do you want us to think about what's taking place there and what the exposure is? Charles Liang : Yes. Very good question. Indeed, the data center and cloud are not new to us. We have been always have a cloud data center business but before with limited production capacity from the U.S.A., especially. That's why we very carefully control to engage with more cloud or large data centers. But now in the last two years, especially, we grow our capacity in Taiwan a lot. So now we have extra capacity and a very good product for cloud, especially private cloud as well. And now even for public cloud, we have specifically optimized solution for that. So we are kind of carefully select some customers, some partners to support them. And the volume can be big, but it will be under careful control. Ananda Baruah : Charles, that's helpful. And so should we think of -- sort of the incremental growth in that area, should we think of it being served out of your Taiwan capacity? Charles Liang : Can be. We hope so. Ananda Baruah : Okay. And I guess my next question is then, to the extent you can share, can you talk about sort of from a customer perspective, not specific names, but would you be, on a public cloud basis, providing that -- those solutions into U.S. hyperscalers, China hyperscalers? I mean, China would make sense because they're being produced so closely. But any context there you can provide would be helpful, too. Charles Liang : Yes. Indeed, both. Indeed, in last many years, we have been always have a large cloud partner. It was just because our capacity was limited. That's why we selected to support them. But now with more capacity available, especially in Taipei, we are ready to be more aggressive to engage with them. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : I had two quick ones. The first one is, Intel made some road map changes a little earlier. And I'm wondering -- with some impacts to the early part of the year, I'm wondering did that impact you at all? Just in terms of -- I mean, I know there's a whole bunch of variables you're dealing with. But did that specific variable impact either bookings visibility or anything over calendar Q1, calendar Q2? Kevin Bauer : I don't think so, not appreciably. Jon Lopez : Okay. Great. My second one, there's sort of a new discussion about some security measures being implemented in China. I just wanted to double check on your exposure there and -- A. And B, would you think that there's any potential impact to you to the extent that those measures move forward? Kevin Bauer : We're not quite sure. We'll have to see. Charles Liang : What's your question again? Jon Lopez : Oh yes, I'm sorry. There's just -- there's sort of some renewed discussion about some tightening of security and export measures between the U.S. and China that may go into effect in a couple of months, and it's sort of an IT-wide phenomenon. Yes. Yes, sorry. No, that's it. Charles Liang : Indeed, our operation have a major portion based in Silicon Valley, right, not since 20 years ago. And then we grew big capacity in Taipei since about 10 years ago. And then our capacity in Taipei has been very big. So that's why now, our major production operation business is still based in the U.S.A. and then Taipei and then some portion in Netherlands, B.V., right? And in China, indeed, a portion have been very limited. Kevin Bauer : That's also true of our sourcing as well, Taiwan richer maybe. Operator : Your next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Two hopefully quick questions. Just back on this whole kind of manufacturing capacity and ability to kind of service more cloud customers. I know several years ago, in the past, you talked about how much actual capacity, how much systems revenue you could support with the footprint you have. Is there any way you can help us today of how much systems revenue could you support with the capacity you have in place? And how much has that expanded just with this expansion in Taipei or Taiwan? Charles Liang : I can provide a rough view and picture, and Kevin maybe later can provide more detail. Basically, we have a huge expansion already in -- both in U.S.A. and Taipei. So overall, today, roughly, we have 30% extra capacity, both U.S.A. and Taipei. And that's why we are ready to grow significantly in the telco market and even the public cloud market. And especially in Taipei, now we are very aggressively increased our operation and production and service capacity because as you know, the cost from Taipei is relatively less than 50% of Silicon Valley. So we, for sure, would like to take that advantage, and it's about right time now. So our actual growth in Taipei can be pretty big. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So Aaron, I think that you just take it from a revenue perspective, that could be maybe getting us to $4 billion or a little bit better. The capacity is there. Obviously, the labor capacity would be increased, as needed, over time. Charles Liang : $4 billion, I think we share with more conservatism. Indeed, it can be $5 billion. James Kisner : All right. That's all the time we have. Any closing comments, Charles and Kevin? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We wanted to thank all of the investors listening in today as well as the analysts. We appreciate you walking this journey through with us as we continue to go through the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. And as you all know, we have our Annual Shareholders' Meeting coming up, which has a very important vote on it, related to us asking for additional shares for an equity plan that is important. And we seek your support for that. So Charles? Charles Liang : Thank you, everyone. We are ready to grow faster now and see you next week -- next quarter, sorry. Thank you. James Kisner : Thank you for the call, operator. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Kisner, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. James Kisner : Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which ended June 30, 2020. By now you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website.  As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events and Presentations tab. We have also published management scripted commentary on our website.  Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2019, our March 2020 10-Q and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation.  At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions.  I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 financial results. Now let's take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal fourth quarter net sales totaled $896 million, up 5% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Our fiscal Q4 earnings per share was $0.68. We saw double-digit growth in Edge applications and some key data center and cloud customers. This was offset by softness from some customers who are seeing the worst effect of the COVID-19 threat.  Before we dive into the financial details, I want to provide you an update on our business strategy. Last quarter, we talked about our 4 strategic high-growth market segments, and we are aligning our resource accordingly to speed up our growth for the coming quarter and years. These 4 strategic market are : first, organic enterprise and channel business, including server, storage, IoT and AI, which are our historical growth areas; second, our new 5G, Edge and Telco business; third, our new large data center and public cloud; and fourth, software and global service.  I'm pleased to share that we have made good progress in 3 of these 4 market categories this quarter. The strategy enable us to win more high-profile customers among enterprise, data center and 5G, Telco infrastructure builders. In addition, we have continued our investment and growth trend in software and service by doubling this team's head count over the past year to prepare a series of higher-value product line.  Unfortunately, COVID-19 pose significant disruption on our organic enterprise and channel business and slowed their growth in the near term. But we are encouraged by our progress in our 2 new strategic drivers this quarter, the large DC and cloud as well as 5G and Telco. And they prove that our overall growth strategy is working well and will drive much stronger results in the future. Going forward, we also plan to accelerate our unique online business into an official phase to complement our strategy. We have been preparing and fine-tuning this business for a few years. And I am optimistic that it will speed up, bringing new revenue growth and profitability to us. How do we move this business into an official phase? Supermicro pride itself in product innovation, which have been the key to our success in the past 27 years. Our server system building blocks, application optimization and resource savings design vision separate us from our competitors, and we are very excited by our recent product introductions. Last quarter, we announced a new AI and machine learning system portfolio that supports the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs based on the latest AMD EPYC processors and Intel coming soon processers, armed with up to 5 PetaFLOPS of performance per 4U system with optimal thermal solution. These systems enable researchers to trend the most sophisticated AI networks at an unprecedented speed.  Next, we have introduced a new 4-way enterprise platform based on the third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, which is optimized to take on deep analytics and mission-critical applications. Most importantly, this quarter, our R&D is hard at work to expand our extensive AMD product lines. And working closely with our partners to seed our next-generation X12 Intel processor-based product line. These engagements will enhance the strong foundation for our growth in the coming quarters and years.  At our recent virtual Storage Summit co-hosted with our partner, Nutanix and Intel, we discussed our completely refreshed storage portfolio. At the event, we introduced storage systems that offer highest data density and optimized system performance for our customers, including our brand-new, second-generation top loading 60- and 90-bay storage, petascale EDSFF, high-performance storage and software-defined solutions.  Switching gear to 5G. We have also been recognized recently by VDC Research as the Top 5G, Telco and Edge solution provider based on the highest customer satisfaction for its application-optimized products. As distributed compute become more critical for 5G infrastructure implementations, our Edge solutions are optimized to be deployed, managed, maintained and secured on a mass scale. We see that most of the 5G, Telco and Edge business opportunity are still in the early phase of deployments. This represent great market share opportunities for Supermicro.  I want to get back and talk a bit more about our calendar quarter and business outlook. The logistical issues, rising shipping costs and employee working from home caused by the spread of COVID-19 in U.S. to disrupt our business in short term. It lower our business and revenue by some points and increase our business cost in short term. As of this time, we have been aggressively shifting and growing certain operation and R&D works to Taiwan. By aggressively and efficiently growing our operation in Taiwan, I'm confident that this big step of change will yield bigger, long-term reward, as our overall cost will be much lower when our operation and production volume in Taiwan ramps. However, we will also continue to optimize our operation in U.S. by better business and production automation to address the ever-changing market dynamics.  In summary, we are able to continue our growth moderately despite the continued disruption caused by COVID-19. We will provide a near-term outlook today that reflects some results from those threats of COVID-19. However, we are very encouraged as we look into the future, as the digital world continue to progress, evolve and grow. Rest assured, we are using this period of disruption as an opportunity to improve our business, global structure by shifting and growing certain portion of operation, production and R&D to Taiwan, a much lower cost country and less COVID-19-disrupted area. This change will result in our mid-term and long-term business revenue and profitability growth. Our enhanced mix of hardware, software and service hybrid focus is the path forward for us to build higher product value, gross margin and revenue growth over time. Our strategy will empower Supermicro, re-accelerate our revenue growth and resume our long history of strong market share gain. With that, we remain very bullish on our long-term opportunity to penetrate our roughly $100 billion TAM.  Finally, we are pleased to announce today a $30 million stock repurchase program. Although the starting amount is modest, we would like to start utilizing our cash on hand to increase shareholders' value while maintaining sufficient cash resource to fund our operation and aggressive growth plan. The stock repurchase program reflects our ongoing commitment to improve the value of our common stock and will help us to offset dilution from our equity plan.  I will now hand the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. First, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, investors and partners for their support as we navigate the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Before jumping into the details of the quarter, we'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our operations. Recall, our largest production and employee presence is in San Jose, California. We continue to operate under increased safety measures for the health of our employees. While we have adapted well to current conditions, we continue to maintain a higher level of inventory and are adjusting our logistics to moderate costs. All that said, while we aren't satisfied with our operating profitability this quarter, we are proud of our results under these unprecedented times. While we don't have unique insight into the long-term trajectory of a global economic recovery from COVID-19, we believe that much of the effects we are seeing on our financials today and over the near term will likely prove transitory.  Now let me turn to the details of the quarter. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenue totaled $896 million. This reflects a 16% quarter-on-quarter increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and a 5% increase from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 83% of total revenue and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter but declined year-over-year.  Turning to geographic performance. On a year-on-year basis, the U.S. was up 4%, EMEA grew 13% and Asia was flat. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales grew 27% as we saw strength at a number of Internet data center and enterprise customers. EMEA grew 3% and Asia grew 2% sequentially.  Before moving down the P&L, I'd like to point out a number of discrete items worth noting for investors. First, we recorded $17.4 million in expense related to incentive awards to our employees that impacted both cost of sales and operating expense. Remember, on our February call, we mentioned that we had expected to incur additional onetime charges of $35 million to $40 million. Second, we paid out approximately $26 million for those awards whose performance criteria was achieved in this quarter. Third, we recovered $4.8 million from customers related to previously reserved bad debt. Lastly, we released $3.3 million in tax reserves following the finalization of certain foreign tax returns for prior years, and our tax rate was reduced for export sales from the U.S.  Turning back to our non-GAAP results. Q4 gross margin was 14%, down 150 basis points year-on-year and 370 basis points quarter-on-quarter. As you've likely heard from other market participants, commodity costs have been volatile. Gross margin was impacted by commodity costs, COVID-related costs and customer mix in that order of magnitude.  Turning to operating expenses. Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 3% quarter-on-quarter to $114 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 5% quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year to $91 million. The sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to the absence of $9.5 million in R&D credits the previous quarter. G&A also benefited from the aforementioned debt recovery. Other income and expense was a $0.7 million loss as compared to a $0.9 million gain last quarter related to the foreign exchange remeasurement of our Taiwan-dollar-denominated loans.  This quarter, our taxes were a $7 million benefit on a GAAP basis and a $2 million benefit on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, we benefited from our new tax structure and settlement on a tax audit, as highlighted in the discrete items mentioned earlier. Lastly, our joint venture contributed income of $3.5 million this quarter as compared to a $1.1 million loss in the previous quarter and income of $0.9 million in the same quarter a year ago.  Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share totaled $0.68 per diluted share compared to $0.84 last quarter and $0.69 last year. Cash used from operations totaled $96 million as we paid out $26 million related to the onetime employee bonuses. And our accounts receivable was up $71 million sequentially on increased sales.  Timing factors contributed to the large use of cash in Q4, and we currently expect cash flow from operations to improve in Q1. CapEx totaled $9 million, resulting in free cash outflow of $105 million. Our closing balance sheet cash position, which excludes restricted cash, was $211 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 87 days, down from 92 days last quarter and within our target range of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 37 days. Day payables outstanding totaled 52 days and inventory days was 101. Now turning to the outlook for our business. The company expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2020, in the range of $720 million to $800 million. In addition to typically somewhat weaker seasonal trends, we are cautious, given significant economic uncertainty. We expect gross margins to improve roughly 70 to 125 basis points sequentially as commodity cost pressures abate. With regard to operating expense, the $4.8 million debt recovery will not repeat, and we expect sequential increases in compensation, product development and the completion of our year-end audit. We expect audit costs to revert to normal levels in the December quarter.  We anticipate the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 18% for the year. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.27 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.35, both on a diluted basis.  Our management team is focused on guiding our company through the continuing challenges presented by COVID-19. Although we're unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 may further impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, we believe we're well positioned financially and strategically as we continue to serve our customers. Finally, as Charles mentioned earlier, we currently announced that our Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until December 31, 2020, or until the authorized funds are exhausted under a 10b5-1 plan. With this small step, we are signaling to investors that we are committed to creating shareholder value with an efficient use of capital. James Kisner : Thank you, Kevin. Operator, we're now ready to open the queue for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Maybe the first question, if you can just talk a little bit about the demand environment. There's been a lot of discussion out there about kind of the cloud, the Internet data center, large data center customers going through some level of a digestion phase. So I'm curious what your insight is in terms of the demand profile there that you're seeing into the current quarter and whether or not you have any kind of indicators of a digestion phase materializing and any extent in terms of how material that might be or how long that could last? Charles Liang : Yes. Very good question. We did see a large data center, especially those social networking, those streaming even gaming large data center have a strong demand during this COVID-19 period, especially. And we have most focus on the other side, enterprise channel. So that kind of increased demand, indeed, that did not help us a lot in June. But likewise, say now, we are extending our operation and business to Taiwan. Hopefully, our cost will decrease. So we will be able to more aggressively participate in those large data center and cloud. And I believe this business may not be seen for another few quarters probably. Kevin Bauer : Yes. Aaron, I can augment that describing a little bit of what we're seeing in the current quarter. So I think evidence that would align with what you're hearing from other parties is that as we entered into July, we definitely saw that our customers were taking a pause after having a strong June. And so I think as opposed to last quarter's comments, where I said we started off strong, and let's see where we go; this quarter, we're seeing a pause in July, yet just currently now, we're starting to see an order -- a flow -- an order flow pickup. So we hope that, that is a good turn to our July results. So a little bit different topology as compared to last quarter. Aaron Rakers : Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked a little bit, I think in your prepared remarks, about kind of \"significant component cost headwinds\", but it sounds like those might be abating here as we move into this current quarter. Can you help us understand or appreciate how you're kind of seeing component cost trends into this current quarter and kind of how much of that 70 to 100 basis point improvement in gross margin might be assumed from component cost dynamics? Kevin Bauer : Sure. I think what we're seeing is that you got a little bit heated with component costs, and things are moderating a little bit. For us, Aaron, it takes time for us to kind of digest inventories that we have on hand. And we believe that towards the end of the quarter, we'll be able to see some moderation in component costs. I think that's a fair portion of what we described in terms of our expectations for Xeon improvement.  Other things that we continue to battle are the momentary high cost of logistics and freight. As we kind of mentioned earlier, it was tough in the last quarter. It kind of loosened up in June. It was looser in July and seems to be tightening up a little bit. But beyond that, what we've done is we've looked at some of our components that we bring from Asia to look at what are those that we can start shipping by sea. It might take a little bit more in terms of inventory holding, but it's definitely worth it when it comes to some components like motherboards and those kind of things, we can afford to do by sea. So we're kind of managing that. And hopefully, we'll have some improvement in that arena as well. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Very helpful. And then a final quick question. There's a lot of discussion out there about Intel timing, and I know it might be longer term in nature around the cadence of their product cycles. But any thoughts that you guys might offer in terms of how the cadence of Intel's moves product-cycle-wise, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer affects your kind of outlook and appreciating that's probably a longer-term question. Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, Intel, as you know, they postponed their 10-nanometer and also the coming 7-nanometer technology. So that did impact some to us. However, we also grow AMD product line very aggressively. So overall, there are some impact for our maybe September quarter. But long term, we should be able to adjust efficiently. Kevin Bauer : Yes. Aaron, that's -- that's one of the considerations as we look forward when I said that product development costs may increase a little bit is that now we have to think about multiple platforms, given the dynamics of Intel's timing and pushing the pedal to the middle a little bit more on alternate processors. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : A few, if I could, Charles and Kevin. Kevin, to start, just a point of clarification. When you were talking about sort of seeing a pause in July after June and now seeing order flow pick up, was that your enterprise and channel business? Or was that the hyperscale public cloud business? Kevin Bauer : I think it's -- we're seeing it on multiple fronts, so not necessarily the hyperscale, but probably more traditional. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Okay. Great. Got it. So you're starting to see a pickup again. And I was going to ask you about the linearity of slowing, but it sounds like it was really a month of July dynamic. Are you -- do you -- any context that you can provide for how we should think about like seasonality into December? I know it's probably lack of visibility, a little murky right now. But any context just for a modeling would probably be useful for us. Kevin Bauer : Yes. That's a little bit hard to call right now. I believe that we all are hoping that things return to normal a little bit and that we have some seasonality certainly in December and maybe a little bit better than normal. I don't know, Charles, do you have anything to augment that? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean September traditionally our soft quarter. And December, we had 20% higher than September in the history. So this year, I believe we will have some impact like that, although coronavirus impacting us, but we are doing what's possible to adjust our workload. We will feel December will be a much stronger quarter, yes. That will be still the case. Ananda Baruah : Really helpful. And I guess just with regards to the cost, sort of the cost optimizing, and you highlighted shift to -- kind of production shift to Taiwan. You guys -- you also mentioned accelerating your online business. Could you just walk us through the different initiatives that will help optimize the cost base? And then maybe give us some sense of timing of how sort of you might begin to be able to benefit from those optimization efforts? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, since about 9 months ago or even 12 months ago, we started to grow in Taiwan aggressively, including engineering, the operation and even sales, even customer service. So that transition will be up now, especially for coronavirus. As you may know, the coronavirus impact in Taiwan is much less than United States. So we are moving to Taiwan for cost reason and for coronavirus impact reason as well. And the result is gradually helping us. And I would like to say that December quarter, it will have more next year, for sure, will be much more efficient. And it's kind of mid-term and long-term investment, but December quarter, we will see some help.  As to our online business, it's basically a complementary business to help our customers to get support, especially spare parts or when they need a mobile system, they can order from online. And that system we have been preparing for many years. And now it is getting very mature. So we start to small-scale business last few quarters. And then we will have a formal official release very soon. Ananda Baruah : That's really helpful, Charles. I really appreciate that. Let me just sneak one more in here. Just -- this is on 5G, your 5G initiatives. And then you had made mentioned a couple of times on the call about seeing public cloud progress. Could you just give us -- put some context around what's going on right now, what you're seeing and experiencing in your 5G and public cloud initiatives? And appreciating that, Kevin, you said that it's been sort of stop, start -- sort of stop, start again. But would love to get a sense of contextually what you guys see going on, the progress that you've made. And then do you think these can be, I don't know, have an impact in the December quarter if things come together for you? Charles Liang : Good. Thank you for the question. Yes, we start to focus on 5G, Telco about 12 months ago. And now we already engaged a handful of good-sized customers. And they are very happy, very convinced with our product. So we see some production, some volume moving since last quarter. And those volumes will ramp up in this quarter and December quarter and especially for next year. And with our operation, growing in Taiwan aggressively now, we soon will be able to ship really high-volume product from Taiwan operations. And that's why it's the time, it's mature for us to start service large-sized cloud and data center. And we already are working with a couple of those potential customers. And the response, again, so far, have been very commendable. So we will continue to push those opportunities. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Nehal Chokshi : All right. Really nice June Q results, by the way. To me, significant narrative of the investment theme here is what you guys have been talking about returning to our heritage of gaining market share. So within that investment theme, can you characterize how you think you did in the June quarter? And what is embedded in your September quarter in terms of market share trajectory? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, last quarter, I started to share, we engaged with another 3-year business drive, right? Large 5G Telco, Large data center and cloud and then software AI and service. So indeed, all the 3 new drivers, we have been growing pretty healthy way. For 5G Telco, we already have some handful customer engaged. Large cloud, we have some customer engaged. And then software AI in service, we continue to gain customers satisfaction, and that's why we like to further promote the scope to service older customers around the world. And we expect that these -- the feedback will be pretty healthy for our business plan. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then for September quarter, do you expect that outperformance to continue, and that's what's embedded in your guidance, and therefore, you're actually expecting the overall market to be down as much as 15% year-over-year? Charles Liang : To be very directly, I mean, we just moved a lot of business to Taiwan, especially operations. And September, the impacts, the advantage from that should be limited. December, I would like to say will be much more significant. And then next year, we're sure we will see a lot of benefit from that. It will take some time to warm up. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Understood. And then, Kevin, you mentioned -- gave some additional detail regarding order trends being relatively weak in July. Is it fair to say it was actually trending down more than 10% year-over-year during the month of July? Kevin Bauer : Well, I'm not going to give a specific number like that, but July was one where it was certainly a weak month. And so we're glad that we've seen the trajectory turn here. So all of that is embedded in terms of the revenue range that we've given. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And why was there a lack of the $9.5 million R&D credit? Can you give more detail on that? And how should we think about going forward? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So last quarter, if you recall, we had a significant onetime event where we received $9.5 million from a partner for a cancellation of a program. And that's all we're just saying. Nehal Chokshi : Got you. Okay... Kevin Bauer : It was a discrete of significant magnitude last quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for some closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you. I would like to thank you, our employees, customers and investors for their continued support. And thank you for joining us today and see you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles? Charles Liang : Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal 2021 first quarter financial results. Now, let\u2019s take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal first quarter net sales totaled $762 million, down 5% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Our fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.55 compared to $0.68 in both the same quarter of last year and in fiscal Q4 of 2020. As we expected, Q1 has been our seasonally low quarter after a traditionally strong quarter in June. This year, despite the continued challenges from COVID-19, we were pleased to deliver revenue and earnings above the midpoints of our guidance ranges. We have been efficiently adjusting to the new normal as a business deemed essential by the state of California, although there are still lots of areas can be and will be further improved regarding COVID impact. At the same time, we have been aggressively growing our operations, R&D and sales functions in Taiwan where the COVID-19 impact is much less than that in our U.S. and EMEA headquarters. During the September quarter, we continued to serve our current customers while enhancing our Taiwan headquarters capacity and capability in production, operation and sales force in order to support our global growth strategy. To sum up, we now have a much bigger and lower cost campus in Taiwan with better productivity for revenue and profitability growth. This is just the beginning of our turnaround effort after recent challenges that I will discuss later. I believe, as our Taiwan campus starts to reach higher economy of scale combined with our cost reduction efforts, revenue and profitability growth will be getting much stronger in the coming quarters and years. I have confidence in capitalization on many new key market opportunities in our approximately $100 billion TAM, especially in APAC, EMEA and the U.S. East Coast. We have been pretty successful at achieving a great market share in the U.S. West Coast, and we aim to duplicate this success in other geographic territories. Let me spend a minute to review our traditional business and the three new growth drivers that I stated in the past two quarter end conference calls. First, our organic enterprise and channel business; second, our new large datacenter, public cloud and OEM business; third, our new 5G, Edge and Telco businesses; and fourth, our software and global services business. We have made good progress in each of the four growth drivers. We have added more new enterprise customers to our accounts and gained a couple of top scale cloud companies. We also have won a couple of top telco partners in each of the EMEA, Asia and USA territories. Moreover, we see our software and service business continues to gain more adoptions worldwide. With the business foundation we have built and the customer pipelines we have nurtured, continued progress is expected in each of these growth areas going forward. Especially in the new large cloud and OEM and the 5G and telco markets, I believe the growth will be a big extra revenue to us. Before moving onto technology and products, I want to take a moment to recall and share the causes of our business slowdown and disruptions over the past three years. First, our 10-K delay in June 2017 followed by our delisting was a significant distraction to management and employees for over three years. Although all the concerns and issues were resolved a few months ago, this disruption had a lasting effect on our business and employee morale. However, we are recovering quickly now. Unfortunately, just as we emerged from our stock delisting and resumed growth in December 2019, COVID-19 came to U.S. and has slowed down enterprise and channel spending badly and that were our traditional focus. Our sales, operations and production performance has been impacted since the end of this March. Regardless of these challenges and disruptions, I want to share with you that Supermicro is still strong. Our strong foundation allows us to find ways to overcome these challenges. We stand alone as the only U.S. server hardware solutions company with the longest record of faster and uninterrupted growth since inception. In the 10 years between our IPO in calendar 2007 and 2017, we grew at a 20% compounded annual growth rate, well above that of the industry at about 3% compounded annual growth rate over the same time period. Our investors should keep these facts in mind. We will prove that we are able to recreate the same growth trajectory or even better very soon. Moving on to technology and products. Our unique Building Block Solution R&D organization is strong and smart at work to expand our product lines with extensive growth in our NVIDIA, AMD and Intel portfolios. Our broadest leading AI platforms and the coming soon new Intel Ice Lake product lines will prove that Supermicro again will be the true hardware industry leader. Some technology highlights in the quarter include the following. We introduced end-to-end PCI-E Gen4 based 1U, 2U and 4U AI systems that deliver 6x AI training and 7x inference performance improvement over previous generation. These AI systems are available with either the latest AMD EPYC processors or the upcoming Intel Ice Lake processors. Second, most importantly we believe our upcoming X12 Ice Lake product line is absolutely going to be the strongest product line in our history. It will be ready to ship as soon as Intel\u2019s new CPU is available. True to our application-optimization product strategy, our X12 product line will provide exactly the best hardware platforms for 5G, AI and telco as well as mega data center applications. Third, we were also the first-to-market with a 1U NEBS Level 3 certified NVIDIA V100 GPU accelerated server, a key enabler for the transition to 5G. And we also delivered the world\u2019s most green efficient Supercomputer presently. By collaborating with Preferred Networks, our system achieved number one in the Green500 with a record-breaking 21.11 gigaflops per watt, 15% higher than the previous worldwide record. Given our leadership in Green IT, this is reflective of the deeper mission of our Company to help preserve our only planet for future generations with products that offer unbeaten energy efficiency. Other than the four business growth drivers, our big production and operation capacity program in Taiwan, and our new strong product pipelines, the Company is also investing in business automation branch, which is our B2B and B2C online business transaction system. We started designing this system five years ago and have recently put extra efforts to finish the phase one milestone. Now, we are able to help our sales and customers to easily select the product configurations and order quickly online. This phase 1 will be open to our sales this November. After that, we aim to open it up to some of our customers in a few weeks. While we continue to fine tune phase 1 features and configuration optimization, phase 2 has already been kicked off with a command center-based structure to further speed up and optimize sales performance and customer satisfaction. This innovative sales and service software program will dramatically improve our business efficiency, scale and quality. In summary, we are back, and we will be soon much stronger than ever before. We believe that the big challenges in the past three years that badly hurt Supermicro are totally behind us now. As we continue to build a much stronger foundation globally, including the much larger new campus in Taiwan, we will leverage these investments to efficiently re-accelerate our business growth and profitability in the coming quarters and years. I appreciate the patience that investors and our employee have shown to our Company during the difficult times, and we aim to reward your support with our fast growth in the near future and long term success. And I believe that we will become one of the top IT infrastructure providers very soon. At the upcoming investor events and analyst day, we will share more details about the scale, scope and schedule of the new Supermicro progress that we have been developing to grow into a top player. The key topics will include : A, our four business drivers; B, our unique technologies and new product lines for AI, 5G telco, and Large Cloud and our organic business; C, our new campus in Taiwan to lower business cost; D, our software and service business status; and E, our B2B and B2C business automation program. Welcome to join us at that time. I will now pass the call to Kevin Bauer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. Our fiscal first quarter revenue totaled $762 million. This reflects a 5% year-on-year decrease from the same quarter of last year and a 15% decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Systems comprised 81% of total revenue and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were down sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year. Turning to geographic performance, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. increased 6%, EMEA declined 12%, and Asia declined 22%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales declined 8% quarter-on-quarter, EMEA declined 32%, and Asia declined 22% sequentially. From a customer point of view, we saw pauses at OEM, cloud service provider and internet commerce customers following strong demand in the June quarter coupled with the normal down cycle of demand from large enterprise customers. This was offset by first time business at the new high profile customers that Charles mentioned earlier. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, Q1 gross margin was 17.1%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and 310 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Recall, on our August earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to improve by 75 to 125 basis points on a sequential basis, chiefly due to a reduction in what were highly elevated commodity and freight costs. As anticipated, we did see improvement from these factors, but also we accrued for a recovery of costs paid in prior periods that benefited this quarter by roughly 130 basis points. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 13% quarter-on-quarter to $99 million. Recall, last quarter\u2019s GAAP operating expenses included $16.2 million in one-time incentive awards to our employees. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-on-year to $95 million. The sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to the fact that Q4 operating expenses benefitted from a bad debt recovery of $4.8 million. Other income and expense including interest expense was a $1.5 million loss as compared to a $1.3 loss last quarter. This quarter our tax expense was $3.7 million on a GAAP basis and $4.8 million on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, this quarter benefited from larger tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14.1% for the quarter. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to approximate 16%, slightly below our prior expectation of an 18% rate. Lastly, our joint venture contributed income of $1.3 million this quarter as compared to income of $3.5 million last quarter and income of $1 million the same quarter a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.55 as compared to $0.68 in both the same quarter of last year and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations totaled $121 million, driven from an improvement from cash flow from operations of negative $96 million in the June quarter, driven largely by changes in working capital. CapEx totaled $12 million, resulting in free cash flow of $109 million. Our closing balance sheet cash position, which excludes restricted cash, was $300 million, while bank debt was $36 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $264 million. And I\u2019ll reminded everyone that we completed our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program before quarter-end wherein we purchased 1.14 million shares at a weighted average price of $26.24. In our earnings release today, we concurrently announced with that our Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to another $50 million of its common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until October 31, 2021 or until the authorized funds are exhausted under a 10b5-1 plan, whichever occurs first. We are currently taking a tactical and opportunistic approach to share repurchase as we fine tune our longer-term capital allocation strategy. Turning to working capital metrics, our Q1 cash conversion cycle was 170 days, (sic) [107 days] up from 87 days last quarter, outside of our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory declined, days of inventory at 118 days remains elevated relative to history given the lower sales level quarter-on-quarter. And days sales outstanding was 44 days while days payables outstanding totaled 55 days. Now, turning to the outlook for our business. The Company expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2020 in a range of $780 million to $880 million. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 160 to 200 basis points sequentially due to the cost recovery discrete event mentioned earlier and higher overhead costs driven by an expected increase in freight. We expect Non-GAAP operating expense level to be flattish quarter-on-quarter. While we\u2019re selectively investing in R&D, this is offset by lower audit costs and actions we took very late in the quarter to selectively reduce headcount. We anticipate the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% going forward. We fully expect diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.47 to fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.58. We now expect our CapEx for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million inclusive of the acceleration of the Taiwan building project mentioned earlier by Charles. In the mean-time, we remain focused on guiding our Company through the volatility presented by the resurgence COVID-19 and ardently rebuild our business momentum as described by Charles. With that, I'll turn the call back to James for Q&A. James Kisner : Thank you, Kevin. Operator, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for taking my questions. My first one is, I think, you guys mentioned internet and cloud as a source of strength in your Q1 results. Can you talk a little bit more about that end market, the margin profile and the revenue impact of these customers and how they factor into your guidance for the next quarter? Kevin Bauer : We're having some trouble hearing the question. I don't know if it's -- whose line it is. We can barely hear Jon. Jon, can you speak up a little bit please and repeat the question? Jon Tanwanteng : I was saying you mentioned cloud and internet as a source of strength in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about the margin profile of those customers and how they factor into your guidance going forward. Kevin Bauer : Sure. So, this was kind of our first take of some of these customers. I would say that, fortunately, as opposed to what some might think, our margin profile was not appreciably different from the margin profile of our other customers. So, we expect and hope that that will hold true on a go forward basis as well. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. Thank you. And then, can you talk about maybe the -- how you see market demand developing over the next two quarters, with the relative puts and takes, whether it be COVID, election concerns and new form launches and new product launches that you're doing internally? Charles Liang : Yes. It's hard to predict. But, as you may know, right, enterprise and channel business may continue to decline gently. And at the same time, the cloud, social networking, communication, video streaming demand still keep strong. And that's why we have created some good customers in large cloud and video streaming territory. So, we started getting some demand from that territory. And that's why our Taiwan operation -- manufacturer in Taiwan, especially for lower cost we have as well. Jon Tanwanteng : Great. That's a good lead off into my next question. I was going to ask about the Taiwan acceleration and how it better positions you, both strategically and maybe if you go into it. How much can you quantify the expected benefit from moving there, over maybe the near term? Charles Liang : Yes. Let me start and Kevin may follow. So, I mean, it's investment for, I would say short-term, mid-term and long-term. So, now this means that in Taiwan cost is much lower than in our USA operation, basically it's about 35% to 50%. So, for mature product, basically we see greatly leverage, the possibility that capacity in Taiwan. And with COVID-19 hit in US is much worse than in Taiwan, in Taiwan we see there almost no impact. And that's why we quickly leveraged our Taiwan operation advantage. And I believe it\u2019s good for our short-term, and gradually, advantage will become much clearer, and much more significant in middle term and long term. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Yes. Thanks. And congratulations on great results all around, especially a strong free cash flow and executing on a share buyback. You guys mentioned that you noticed areas of recent improvement that gives you confidence that year-over-year growth is bottoming here. Can you discuss exactly which areas are you seeing that recent improvement in? And from what point in time are you referencing as well where that demand profile has improved? Kevin Bauer : So, I think, we just navigated a period that was challenging. We kind of gave some guidance in terms of how we think that it is gently going to improve in the December quarter here, based upon visibility that we have. I think, also, when we talked about some of those new customers, some of the lead times for their materials are longer in length, such that we get a little bit better visibility as to their plans for the March quarter. And so, therefore, I think, it's some of those feeds of information that make us believe that as we continue to accelerate quarter-by-quarter that there is some tangible evidence of people's plans, not perfect visibility but there's some that's out there to be able to latch on to. I don't know if you have anything else in addition to that, Charles. Charles Liang : Yes. Nehal, I just mentioned, I mean, in last quarter, I mean, especially after the impact of COVID-19, we started to focus on larger accounts, high profile, high-volume accounts for large cloud, a large data center and video streaming customer for example, 5G, telco. And we started to gain some very good partnership. And we started to ship some. And however, very high volume, it takes some time to ramp up. So, like Kevin say, I mean December quarter, we will see some help. March quarter and next year, June quarter, I believe we'll see much bigger help. Kevin Bauer : Yes. I thought of one thing that investment community understand that a little bit better is that some of these new customers are actually ordering rack scale products from us that with that longer lead time give us some visibility. Nehal Choski : I see. Okay. And second question I have is that the nice slide here on your key vertical markets and growth drivers. I think, this is a bit of an evolution of the Supermicro 3.0 vision that you guys had previously talked about. And within that Supermicro 3.0 vision, implied in that was a potential for margin expansion. And this new way of presenting it, does that opportunity still present itself? And can you talk a little bit about how that might actually look in terms of a long-term margin profile? Charles Liang : Yes. Very good question. I mean, that we mentioned of our Supermicro 3.0 about three years ago, unfortunately, a 10-K delay that delayed the outcome of our project. The good thing is now it\u2019s all over. So, we started to execute our Supermicro 3.0 now stronger. For example, 5G, edge and telco business, software and global service. So that has been helping our business and we will become a much significant help quarter-over-quarter. As to data center and cloud, even private cloud business has been growing, and we will continue to invest in that area. So, it should be a very significant driver for us in short-term, mid-term and even long-term, especially long-term I would say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I just wanted to ask a question about server cycle. You referenced in your prepared remarks, Intel's Ice Lake, you also have AMD Milan processors. It sounds like you guys continue to see overall ASP increases in your system, system sales. How are you thinking about like Intel with eight channels of memory from six? How do you think about the ASP trend relative to unit growth as you think about the setup in the calendar '21? Charles Liang : Yes. More and more customers now really appreciate our total solutions, not just telecom but the CPU, memory, hard drive, and total solution including management software, including some even application software. So including a spatial memory, where we mention a kind of SSD NVMe, and -- total solution has been our long-term goal, and complete right solution. And very soon we will share with you even more about our private cloud total solution. But, it's a little bit too early to say too much. But yes, we are moving forward to a total solution. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then, maybe sticking on a similar topic. Gross margin was very strong this quarter, up quite a bit on a sequential basis. I'm just curious of what you're seeing on the component pricing environment. What are you embedding in your current quarter expectations, as far as DRAM and flash pricing trends, and any thoughts on how that sets up into next year? Thank you. Charles Liang : Yes. I mean economical scale will help us. So, we are growing global now. And with new business drive, that will grow our revenue, our economic scale. And that will help our gross margin and then the margin ratio. At the same time, the service business, the software value is getting help to our profit as well. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Nick Heisler with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. It's actually Mehdi Hosseini. I have a couple of follow-ups. Kevin, can you help us understand how OpEx is going to play out for the rest of the fiscal year '21? Kevin Bauer : So, I think, we said that we took some actions in this quarter. We trimmed some headcount. We actually did a similar kind of trim at the end of September that kind of bore fruit here in the December quarter. I think, as we look forward in terms of the pace of our hiring, as Charles has mentioned earlier, if we're going to appreciably hire anyone that's going to be Taiwan-based over the course of time, I think, our views of OpEX now on a non-GAAP basis is that -- I think we said quarter-over-quarter, somewhat flat, may drift a little bit in the March or June quarter, if COVID lifts and we feel that it's appropriate to give merit increases. But I think we're trying to hover in the mid-90s for a period of time here. And I think that's what you were looking for. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Got it. And then, two more questions. One for Charles, given your expansion in Taiwan, and how CapEx has effectively increased by 2 to 3 times over a two year period. In the meantime, you have been able to diversify and target a wider range of end market. How should we think or envision opportunities? In the past, you used to give us a $3 billion revenue target, you're already there. I'm not asking you, if you're going to double your revenue, given the increase in capacity. But, in the longer term, it seems to me that you can hit revenue CAGR that could be more of a double-digit growth, given the 2 to 3-time increase in CapEx over the next -- over the last two years. Is that the right way to think about opportunities in the next one or two years? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, a very good question. I mean, as you may know, right, I mean, our DNA, I mean, since 2000 -- year 2000 to 2017, pretty much our yearly compound growth has been about 20% yearly. So, I don't believe we won't return to that growth rate or better. We'll take the delay behind us. And although COVID-19 is challenging us, but now we enable Taiwan operation, the opportunity in Taiwan with lower cost, with almost no COVID-19 impact, I feel very confident we will get back to 2 digital growth here very soon, hopefully not just 2 digital, hopefully, we can have -- no reason we cannot get back to more than 20% or 30% growth yearly. So, I have a very good feel and very excited to -- in the next few years at least. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And hopefully, it will be with a higher margin business. And in that context, Kevin, how should I think about either absolute utilization rate for U.S., San Jose versus Taiwan, or if you don't want to disclose a specific utilization rate, which region is higher. I'm comparing U.S. San Jose to Taiwan? Kevin Bauer : Well, right now, the U.S. utilization is higher. I think, you heard in my prepared remarks that at the current time, Europe and Asia are suffering a little bit more than the U.S. because the U.S. was the location where we got these new marquee customers. But, I think on a go-forward basis, that capacity utilization needs to obviously increase, and we'll get some leverage off of that. I think it's also fair to say that with -- the U.S. building is not under active construction at the moment. We're taking a little bit of a pause with it where we're moving forward with the Taiwan building. I think, once those both get built out, we may have capacity to, on a full tilt basis, almost get to like $6 billion. So, we would be building that over the course of time, as necessary. I'm just talking about the Shell and its capabilities. But, that's the kind of profile I think that we're looking at, to answer your question. Charles Liang : Yes. Indeed, to reach $6 billion, our cap investment won't increase too much because the facility capacity pretty much ready here. Kevin Bauer : Yes. So that kind of describes. And in previous calls, I talked about how after we get these buildings done, then our CapEx is going to go back to the modest maintenance. And now you have an understanding of where that's going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop. Ananda Baruah : A few for me, if I could. Just to start, how should we think about the drivers in the December quarter? Could you tell us what you think the biggest aspects of your business are that will influence the incremental sequential revenue in the December quarter? Charles Liang : With COVID-19, we try to be conservative. So today, we give a range of $780 million to $880 million. I hope it's a conservative number. And again, that's why we just mentioned, we are gaining a high-profile customer in large cloud, 5G, telco and video steaming all kind of business. So, I believe next few quarters should be our good quarter to grow. Kevin Bauer : Yes. I think, Ananda, also we're going to see some return of the customers that took the pause in September. Ananda Baruah : Got it. Some of the more classic on-prem, on-prem so it sounds like. Is that right, Kevin? And Charles, I appreciate your comment about... Kevin Bauer : I gave a long list of expected customers, including OEMs and such. So, it\u2019s broad. Ananda Baruah : Got it. And just with regards to Ice Lake, and I don't want to make -- I don't want to stitch things together that aren't intended to be stitched together. But, in the prepared remarks, I think it was Charles, you made mention of slight improvement in December. And then, it sounded like kind of in the first half of next year calendar or maybe kind of in first half, a stair step kind of take up. Those are my words, but that sounded like the spirit of it. And I guess the question is, to what degree does the availability of Ice Lake play in that relative to just demand you think can get better, regardless of Ice Lake, Ice Lake or not? Charles Liang : Yes. As you may know, Intel Ice Lake now can be available very soon, end of this year or early next year. And we have the strongest product line ever, all available now. Once the Intel CPU in production, will be ready to ship. [Indiscernible] product line. So, we are all ready. Ananda Baruah : And it sounds like you think that will have a pretty significant impact when availability occurs. Charles Liang : Yes. We are waiting for the new CPU to be available. Ananda Baruah : Okay, great. And just a linearity question, how did you guys experience it this quarter? And what are you seeing in this month to start, to start December quarter? So how did you experience in the September quarter? And how does -- how do you feel about sort of November -- sorry, October so far in the context of linearity? Charles Liang : You mean in terms of Ice Lake or overall business? Ananda Baruah : Overall, overall. Thanks. Charles Liang : Overall, I believe the business will be getting stronger, getting better for us for a couple of reasons. Number one, we just created some very-high profile customer in the last few months. And those ramp-up is pretty predictable. And second is our current operation is getting ready, and we just grow some strong team in Taiwan, those team are ready to grow. So, we have a very good feeling in the near future, especially next calendar year should be a strong year for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open. Jon Lopez : I just want one clarification, Kevin, if I could, which is, deferred the last couple of years had trended up pretty nicely. It's kind of flattened out over the last couple of quarters. I'm wondering, is that just because unit volumes have dropped off? And is it just a function of attach, or is there something else influencing that line item? Kevin Bauer : Well, there is some attach, but it's also true that contracts that we entered into in 2018 through early part of 2019, if you recall, had very elevated commodity costs, and the car for the service as a percentage of revenue. So, we had some more expensive contracts historically. I think, we do want to continue working on our attach rate. We do better in some regions than the other, and we need to work on some offshore attach rates, to be frank. Jon Lopez : Got you. Okay. That's really helpful. Secondly, I'm wondering if you could just rewind a little bit, my recollection, as you guys exited the prior quarter like calendar Q2 was that the bookings activity had slowed pretty sharply. Can you just walk us from there to here? Was there a pretty appreciable increase in bookings activity? Did that occur pretty linearly? How does that look exiting calendar Q3 versus say exiting calendar Q2? Kevin Bauer : It's gotten healthier. I mean, hence the guidance. Jon Lopez : Fair point. Okay. Two more quick ones, if I could. My recollection is, cloud, if you look back a couple of years, I can't remember what you guys called it back then, maybe Internet data center, but it was around 20% of the business or oscillated around that level. Can you guys give us just a rough sense for where that sits now? Kevin Bauer : Yes. We still are not splitting out our revenue segments right now. But, I will that the topography of it is quite different now. And that is, is that back in the day that you're referring to, it was a pretty large, greater than 10% customer, where we're greater diversified in that segment right now. Jon Lopez : Got you. And just on that point, Kevin, is the right way to think about this that you guys are, I mean, for lack of a better term, kind of reentering that vertical? Maybe just talk a little bit about what you guys are perhaps doing differently now. Are you -- it sounds like perhaps diversifying the customer base is one thing. Are you guys pursuing different use cases? Is there maybe a bit more geographic spread here? Maybe just talk for a second about how you think about that vertical now versus perhaps how you did, say, two, three years ago? Charles Liang : Maybe I can share. I mean, we saw our facility in Taiwan getting bigger. And of course, it\u2019s much lower than our operation in USA. So, with that advantage, now we will start to approach that market much more aggressively than the last few years. So, in the other words, we will actually focus on that territory very soon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CGS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi. Just a quick follow-on to that question. Is it fair to say that it's the cost advantage of moving to Taiwan that\u2019s enabling you to win those customers at this point versus whatever else you may be bringing to the table? Charles Liang : Yes. Because those large data center, they buy a lot, but they want a more aggressive price. So, with our Taiwan operation, now we are much ready to service customers like that. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Charles Liang. Charles Liang : Thank you a lot for joining us today, and looking forward to seeing you in person, hopefully very soon. And have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. James Kisner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. James Kisner : Good afternoon and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended December 31, 2020. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events & Presentations tab. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal year 2020 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles? Charles Liang : Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results. Now let's take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal second quarter net sales totaled $830 million, down 5% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially, landing at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our fiscal Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63 compared to $0.55 in fiscal Q1 of 2021 and $0.57 in the same quarter of last year. As we expected, Q2 improved after a seasonally weak Q1. We are proud that we achieved these results despite a very challenging environment as the impact of COVID-19 was significantly worse since early November, which impacted our operations, especially in USA headquarter.  Over the same period, however, we had significant international growth to offset the weakness in the United States. Quarterly sales in many Asian and European countries were up double digit, and in some case, a very high double digit, which demonstrates the strength and the improvement of our global sales organization and channel partners around the world. I expect this strong international business growth to continue in March quarter and the future. On the topic of our aggressive growth strategy, our new high-profile customers mentioned on our last earnings call the digested recent purchase in Q2, and we remain excited about our relationship with these customers. Additionally, our sales team are continuing their efforts to expand and nurture new opportunity in these accounts for the next few quarters and years. While these efforts have been on track with our internal goal, we have recently speed up our effort to win new accounts addressing the demands. We plan to further accelerate this growth with new incentive programs and executive action. The purpose of these actions, other than to supercharge our sales force is to restore our original winning culture. We have set aggressive goal for ourselves, and my team is deeply committed to Supermicro's future with more and more passion. To support this international and global growth strategy, we have aggressively expanded our Taiwan campus capacity and capability in production, operations, engineering and sales. The new Building 62 at our Taiwan Science & Technology Park will be online early this summer, which will add another 1 million square feet of manufacturing and office space, efficiently doubling our production capacity within next 6 to 8 months. In the short term, this effort will alleviate some logistics, production and engineering impact caused by COVID-19. In the long term, I believe that our Taiwan campus start to reach higher economic of scale, revenue and profitability growth will become much stronger in the coming quarters and years. To complement our effort in Taiwan, our building transitioning in San Jose is on schedule to become online in the next quarter, which will further boost our strong American manufacturing credentials. I'm confident these actions will help us capitalize on many new key market opportunities in our approximately 100 billion TAM. Let's move on to technology and products, with the unique building block solution product approach. Our R&D organizations are hard at work to expand our optimized Intel, AMD and NVIDIA portfolios. In addition, we had doubled our software and service headcount and resource over the past 2 years. These investments are making a great impact on improving customer experience in both solution quality and security. With the upcoming new Intel Ice Lake processor, we again bring the time-to-market advantage, high-product quality and application optimized solutions to our customers. We are pleased to see a strong trend in terms of customer seeding and early deployment request, and we have started some of our early deployments to our key customers recently. True to our application optimized product strategy, we believe our Ice Lake product line will provide precisely the best hardware platforms to telco, 5G and AI as well as data center applications. As such, we are prepared for our Ice Lake product line to become a key growth driver in the coming quarters. Although COVID-19 continues to disrupt steadily, our strong foundation has safely supported our company and business. As I have mentioned, we have taken decisive actions to expand our operations, engineering and sales -- our sales team in Taiwan to further reduce the COVID-19 impact. These efforts, together with our application optimized Building Block Solution, have resulted in great progress with our focused business vertical. First, our organic business gained more than 10% new major customer server accounts in the last few quarters, benefiting from our strong product line and expanded Taiwan operations. Our B2B automation, auto-configurators as well as software and service enhancements, will continue on this growth momentum. Second, we start to refocus on large data center and OEM since about 3 months ago, right after our 10-K was filed. Two high-profile customers has started to ship in small volume recently, and we'll ramp up to a larger scale later this calendar year. We plan to add 1 or 2 more large DC, large data center, our OEM customers in this category before the end of this calendar year. Third, on 5G, telco and IoT, we have won a handful of new telco customers last year. We are currently starting to ship small volume with upside, and we expect high-volume shipments to these customers will start this calendar year as well. And number four, our B2B and B2C automation with auto congregator has been greatly improved in the past 3 quarters, which is even more critical as COVID-19 forced more remote working environment for lots of customers and our own employees. We have been developing this powerful project for the past 5 years, and it will be ready to go live by this quarter end. This will make it much easier to share communication and product correlation among our sales, engineer and our customers. As discussed in our last earnings call, we believe that Q1 of fiscal 2021 will prove to be a near-term focus in our business. And our Q2 results are the first proof point that Super Micro is indeed back on the growth track. I'm excited that our recent booking activity, along with our new business initiatives, give us the confidence to provide the Q3 guidance that, if achieved, will reflect a resumption of quick growth on a year-on-year basis. Furthermore, we are pleased to announce a newly approved $200 million of share repurchase program, which investors will view as a sign of our commitment to enhance stockholder value and our confidence in our long-term business success. I will share more detail about our strong growth plan, business scale, our unique momentum and when and how will we reach $10 billion revenue in the coming soon investor event. As the only fast-growing server solution, hardware design and manufacturer company in the U.S. in the last 27 years, Supermicro 3.0 is nearly 100% ready. I mean we are ready to grow quickly. But before I pass on, I'd like to take this chance to announce the appointment of David Weigand as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David joined the company in May 2018 as Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer. A CPA and native of Silicon Valley, David came to Super Micro from HP Enterprise where he worked as a Vice President. He was previously the CFO of Renesas Electronics America Inc. David succeed Kevin Bauer, who is our current CFO and is leaving the company to pursue his passion at a not-for-profit organization at the end of this month. It has been a privilege working with Kevin, and I appreciate his great leadership, hardworking and dedication to Super Micro over the past 4 years. Kevin is accredited for improvement over our financial system and many system automation. I wish him a great success in his new venture.  I will now pass the call to Kevin one last time to provide additional detail on the quarter and our outlook. Kevin, please? Kevin Bauer : Thank you, Charles. I'd like to say a few words to our employees and investors. I have enjoyed working with Charles and the very dedicated Super Micro team and helping the company through challenging times over the last 4 years. I am most proud of the work enhancing our company's financial function, providing a stronger foundation for the company to continue to grow as well as our focus on improving operations to generate cash, which enabled a return of capital to shareholders. To all the Super Micro team, we have accomplished so much together, yet there is unfinished work. Carry on. On a personal note, my new role will be in an area where I have strong passion for and also serves a community that I have a long association with. I'm excited to join as the Chief Financial Officer and key business executive to help this organization to reach its objective of delivering increasing value. When announced, this new role will make sense to you all. Before jumping into the results of the quarter, I'd like to briefly touch on several accomplishments we made this quarter on the environmental, social and governance, or ESG front, which we recognize is becoming increasingly important to investors. A few of our recent accomplishments include : one, driven by our efforts to comply with social environmental concerns, Supermicro received a near-perfect audit score from the Responsible Business Alliance at our Taiwan manufacturing site in November 2019 with a score of 196.4 out of 200 points. In December 2020, we set a commitment letter to the Science Based Targets initiative, and We Mean Business coalition, indicating we will join other companies in striving to keep global warming to the 1.5-degree goal and create company targets. We also joined other leading companies in the Green Grid, where we believe our expertise in hardware design and energy-efficient computing can help drive forward the industry. In January '21, Supermicro transitioned its San Jose Grid Energy sourcing to wind RECs, signifying that, in conjunction with our Bloom Energy fuel cells, all our use of energy at our new and old San Jose campuses will not result in the burning of fossil fuels. We believe these recent accomplishments and milestones continue a long history of our commitment to green computing, sustainability and generally making the world a better place for future generations. Now turning back to 2Q results. Our fiscal second quarter revenue totaled $830 million. This reflects a 5% year-on-year decrease from the same quarter of last year and a 9% increase from the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Systems comprised 70% -- 77% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially but down year-over-year. System ASPs increased year-over-year but were down modestly quarter-on-quarter. Turning to geographic performance. Our international sales strengthened from 2 quarters of softness. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. decreased 12%, Europe increased 5%, Asia declined 3%, and the rest of the world increased 68%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales declined 7% quarter-on-quarter, Europe increased 38%, Asia increased 27% and the rest of the world increased 86%. From a customer point of view, we saw a pickup in sales to OEM customers, but this was offset by the expected digestion after a strong Q1 contribution by new high-profile customers that we mentioned last call. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L. Q2 gross margin was 16.4%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and down 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Recall on our November earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to decline 160 to 200 basis points on a sequential basis, chiefly due to the absence of a, cost-recovery benefit as well as elevated freight costs. While we did see elevated freight costs, we did, however, benefit from additional cost recovery, similar in magnitude to the benefit we experienced in fiscal Q1 or about 130 basis points. We do not anticipate a similar benefit going forward. Turning to operating expenses. 2Q OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 1% quarter-on-quarter and 11% year-on-year to $99 million. Q1 GAAP operating expense benefited from a credit of $2.1 million for an executive SEC settlement, and Q2's GAAP operating expenses contain $2.5 million in special performance bonuses. Without these factors, Q2 GAAP operating expenses would have been down more significantly quarter-on-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 5% quarter-on-quarter and 12% year-on-year to $90 million. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to lower audit fees, lower R&D expense due to higher-than-normal NRE for credit -- sorry, credits for NRE work performed and overall expense discipline. Other income and expense was $13.1 million loss as compared to a $1.5 million loss last quarter. The, increased loss was chiefly driven by the remeasurement of our Taiwan dollar loans to a weaker dollar. This quarter, our tax expense was $5.1 million on a GAAP basis and $7.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16.4% for the quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 16%. Lastly, our joint venture contributed a loss of [$1.0 million] this quarter related to an air pocket in revenue, as compared to income of $1.3 million last quarter and a loss of $1 million the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.63 as compared to $0.55 in Q1 of fiscal '21 and $0.57 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations totaled $63 million compared to cash flow of operations of $121 million in Q1. CapEx totaled $14 million, resulting in free cash flow of $49 million. Our closing balance sheet position for cash was $315 million, while bank debt was $45 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $270 million. Please also note that we completed our previously announced $50 million share repurchase program on January 6, wherein we repurchased 1.68 million shares at a weighted average price of $29.82. As Charles mentioned in our earnings release today, we concurrently announced that we have Board-level authorization for the company to repurchase up to another $200 million of our common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until July 31, 2022. As Charles mentioned, we believe this action reflects our commitment to enhancing stockholder value and our positive long-term view of our business opportunity and cash generation prospects. We expect to execute the program in coordination with our cyclical working capital needs and growth. Turning to working capital metrics. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 92 days, down from 107 days last quarter, but still outside our target of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory declined, days of inventory at 105 days remains elevated relative to our historical levels as we prepared for the impact of the Lunar New Year logistic challenges and some tightening of components. Days sales outstanding was 36 days, while days payable outstanding totaled 49 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, in the range of $790 million to $870 million. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 120 to 160 basis points sequentially due to the lack of a cost recovery discrete event that we explained earlier over the last 2 quarters and also the product mix that we expect to ship in the quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating expense level to increase quarter-on-quarter to the mid-90s driven by payroll taxes in the new year and selective investing in R&D. We continue to anticipate our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16% going forward. And we expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $1 million and expect a contribution from our JV of roughly $0.5 million. We fully expect fully diluted GAAP -- I'm sorry, we expect fully diluted GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.42 and fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.57. And we continue to expect our CapEx for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, inclusive of our ongoing Taiwan building project mentioned earlier by Charles. James, we're now ready for Q&A. James Kisner : Thank you, Kevin. One quick announcement before entering Q&A, we will be attending the Goldman Technology Conference on February 11 and conducting meetings with investors. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have your first question from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Congrats on solid results. And Kevin, congrats as well. It's been good working with you. Well, good luck and we'll miss working with you. Yes, I guess a couple if I could. I guess the first one is just broadly speaking, how should we -- how would you like us to think about the various catalysts as we move through the year and the things that we should keep an eye out for and what you're expecting to impact the business? You spoke to a number of them on -- in the prepared remarks, I would just love to sort of get to more context on how we should think about them layering in. Then I have a follow-up or 2. Charles Liang : Yes. I believe our business have been very solid now, except COVID-19, so in USA is still very severe. So we are very carefully taking care of that, while kind of aggressively grow our operation business in Taiwan. So COVID is getting better as now we expect. Our business should be getting to a much smooth -- much strong growth period. So we have a good feeling about the coming quarters or years. Ananda Baruah : And Charles, when you think about sort of some of the newer aspects to your business, and you mentioned Ice Lake as well in coming quarters, hyperscale, Ice Lake. You mentioned sort of the 5G systems going in to the telcos, which of those -- could you sort of rank for us, even if anecdotal, which ones of those do you think would be the most impactful when you look back on 2021, hyperscale, Ice Lake, the 5G telco business? Charles Liang : Yes, like I just shared with everyone, we start to focus on large data center and OEMs since about 3 months ago. And we already achieved a couple of them. And they start to move. And we believe that volume we will ramp up very soon in this year and next year, I believe. As to 5G telco, again, we already engaged a handful customers, kind of the world-class telco company. So relationship has been created very solidly, and they start to move, some in small volume, and we also expect some high volume will follow very soon, and it will be long-term partnership. So overall, we are very optimistic for our long-term growth. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Great. I'm going to sneak one last one in here. Charles, I believe it was you in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the analyst event. Do you have a time frame you're thinking about for that? Charles Liang : Yes. You mean the investor event? Ananda Baruah : Investor event, yes. Charles Liang : Yes. I hope within the next few weeks because we still have the last quarter. But because of COVID-19 as really coming very bad, so we kind of take a wait-and-see. But now look like it seems getting under control. So I hope in the next few weeks, we will have a big investor event, so to share the company plan, future, the momentum with our investment. Ananda Baruah : That's excellent. So just -- just so I'm -- just to clarify for myself. In the next few weeks, do you think you'll be announcing the date of the event? Or do you think you may actually be having it in the next few weeks or so? Charles Liang : I guess we will announce it in the next 2 weeks, for example, and hopefully have that event in 3 to 4 weeks. Operator : We have your next question from Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Jon Tanwanteng : A very nice quarter. And Kevin, congratulations on moving on to the next phase. My first question is on just hearing Intel when they spoke about the quarter, they thought they were seeing another quarter or 2 of digestion in the cloud and data center space. It seems like you're not seeing that. I was wondering what kind of customer are you seeing strength from that's maybe running counter to what they're saying? Is it maybe just from AMD? Or is it another end market? Just give me a sense of why your strength is running opposite to what they're seeing? Charles Liang : Yes. As you know, we have a very strong Intel product line. At the same time, we also have a pretty big AMD product line. So once the market have demand, we will grow. And even if the market keep flat, because of our outstanding product, our kind of data solution overall, so we believe once the market is not too bad, we will have a chance to grow smoothly kind of -- and if the market is growing, I guess our growth will be very significant. And as you know, since the company was funded since 1993 to 2017, our growth has been always much faster than the industry average, and I believe we are getting back to that position very soon. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. And then just on the impact that COVID has had on the business, can you call out just the impact on either the margin or the revenue that you had in December and into January so far? You mentioned higher freight expenses, but lockdowns probably had an impact as well. I don't know if you're seeing anything else such as employee absenteeism. But if you could kind of quantify or give some color on the impact of the pandemic so far, that would be helpful. Charles Liang : Yes, it's kind of -- impact is very bad and very broadly, unfortunately, in that -- more than 9 months now. So our logistical, for example, it's become very harder to ship products. Even from Asia to U.S.A., we see the shipping delay cost increase [indiscernible] or even more, sort of logistic time-to-market delay and logistics cost increase. And then lots of customer work from home and some of our employee work from home. So all of those created a difficulty for business, especially for application optimized solution. And the good thing is that our auto congregator, which is a program to help sales, help our engineers, help our customer to work together to make the best optimized solution for them. The tool is getting ready. I believe by end of this quarter, most of our sales engineer and customer will be able to use those tools. So I'm very excited for the tool to be available in this quarter. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Great. If you don't mind me asking one more... Kevin Bauer : Yes, John, this is Kevin. I would just echo what Charles has said is that when you have work from home, it definitely reduces the coordination of the organization. So we have to push harder in that arena. And then some other examples like just having to confirm that there's someone else on the other side to receive the shipment, not all companies are open every day. So there's definitely a lot of little different things like that, that make conducting business more difficult, like Charles had said. Jon Tanwanteng : Understood. And if I may ask, looking beyond the pandemic, and Charles, I know your new facility is opening up in the second half of this year or earlier this summer, what can margins look like on a normalized basis? So without all of these headwinds, when you have new facilities and when you have some more volume than the customer shipping, maybe share some of the plans you have and go where margins could go. Charles Liang : Yes. As you know, we have two kind of customers. One is a high-end enterprise. We like our better product, better performance, better service. And then we also have another customer who buy high volume and they want lower cost. So before most of our operations are tied in U.S.A and with COVID-19, the impact was really big. But now we have a tower in operation getting ready, especially by early summer, we will have a much bigger capacity. So we can start to service those customers who buy high volume and cost sensitive. So we are very excited. We start to line up with those customers since about 12 months ago. Now we have some customer relationship that are already established and we already promised them that we are ready to support them. So in terms of how much impact, I would like to say maybe 2% or a little bit more than that. And 2% for enterprise, something that small. But for high-volume customer, that 2% or 3%, indeed, is a big difference for them. So we are very happy we have those opportunity now ready from Taiwan. Operator : We have your next question from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Securities. Nehal Chokshi : Congratulations on the strong gross margin and a very strong revenue guidance. That's a really nice outlook there. On the net income, the midpoint of the net income that implies about a $9 million [QB] decline. How should we parse that between gross margin and OpEx for the March quarter? Kevin Bauer : Well, I think we shared that we thought that the gross margin would be declining quarter-over-quarter because of some cost increases as well as the specific mix of products that we're going to ship. So, I would say that you would weigh it probably towards what the expectations are for gross margin in the immediate quarter going forward. That would be the heavier weight, we'll put it that way. Nehal Chokshi : That's very helpful. And then Charles, could you clarify what you mean by large OEM opportunity? Charles Liang : Okay. I mean especially of the pandemic, COVID-19 problems happened, all our Internet, all our social networking company have a strong demand. And those high-volume customers, indeed, they move in high volume, but they want low price, right? So, before we kind of -- did not really focus on those segment of customer. But because our Taiwan operation facility is getting ready, so we start to work with those customers, engaged with them. And we got some very good feedback. So, we are really engaged with some of them. And like what I just mentioned, we ship a small volume now and the high volume should follow later this year. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So just to be clear, is there a partnership with the HP and Dells to get to the social networks? Or are you just referring to these large Internet properties as the OEMs? Charles Liang : The good thing about Super Micro is in the last 27 years, we already established our brand name and our credibility for quality, for service. And now, especially our management software, our service is global wide, have been well recognized by enterprise accounts. So, we are ready to work with any kind of customer, directly with any customer or we'll go through some OEM. So we open that opportunity. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And coming back to Kevin. So, over the past few quarters, you guys have returned 50% of free cash flow to shareholders by share repurchases, which is very good. So, I know that you guys said that you wanted investors that you're evolving your capital allocation policy. But is that 50% rate at least a good way to think about how that -- you guys are thinking going forward? And then what about that remaining 50%? Is that basically near the future growth? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So, I think what I tried to share was that in the new $200 million program, it's got roughly an 18-month or so duration given the date that it's valid through. I think investors that I've worked with know that we take an incremental approach, and we took first two steps in stock buyback program. We got feedback that if we feel confident, we should back that up by maybe a more longer-term program, and that is exactly what we have done. So therefore, it's a step-by-step process. I think the competing forces for the capital allocation is going to be the rate of our growth. That's the key thing. And we hope to be able to continue to grow strongly and have the adequate cash flow to consume or to fully execute that $200 million program over the 18-month time frame. So, it's definitely that as well as the investments we need to continue to make in R&D for continued product development.  Given that, as it relates to Taiwan, we're kind of in the late mid-innings on the investment there. Certainly, the building is close to being completed there. I think it's going to be June or something like that, Charles? Charles Liang : Yes, June. Kevin Bauer : And so therefore, that consumption of cash will abate for a while because our maintenance capital is like $5 million to $7 million a quarter. And so that will help free up some cash in the second half of calendar 2021. And that's kind of the moving pieces that we're thinking about. And with the continued cash generation of the company, we felt confident to get to $200 million program. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Fantastic. And my final question, before I get back in the queue is that you mentioned that NRE work was part of that R&D Q-on-Q decline. So, what's the decision for when Supermicro sets this type of work? Can you talk about that real quickly? Kevin Bauer : Yes. So, we worked very closely with some of our chief component suppliers to work on platforms that work with their key components. And so, we really look to work with those key vendors to enable platforms that we believe are ones that are going to get traction in the marketplace. So, we look at what's the likely popularity of those platforms and then enter into those arrangements. They tend to be rather short term in nature. So I want to share with you that it's not like a multiyear development, but rather maybe a half year development. So, it's a little bit easier to make those commitments because -- but not only they're not so large, but also the prospects for the product are pretty close in the future. Charles Liang : Yes. I'll try to -- also the pace, basically. We have some very close partner. They really want us to present something unique, something that outperform for the market. And also some customers, they want to really outstanding, unique platform design. So we work with both vendors and customers, so for those special design and usually they pay some NRE. Nehal Chokshi : What's the type of return in terms of revenue or gross profit dollars you can typically see when you pick this type of NRE product that expect to become a platform that drives future sales? Charles Liang : For sure, our goal is not for NRE data. Our really goal is for a partnership. When you work with a vendor to design, really optimize the solution, then we together approach the market. Same thing for customers. Some customers with their special application or data center equipment or architecture, we have planned, designed something exactly optimized for their environment. And because of Building Block Solution nature, makes Supermicro are much easier and much more efficient to design those unique solution model. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have your next question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Congrats, I guess on this awesome -- and Kevin, also great working with you in the past. I guess I wanted to ask a question about kind of where we stand on the server cycle and the impact that we can think about this having for Supermicro. So you talked a little bit about Ice Lake. You've got AMD Milan. How do you guys see the demand profile for these next-generation server CPUs materializing? And would you expect to see an ASP uplift benefit Supermicro as these next-gen CPUs come into the model? Charles Liang : Yes. As you know, a new generation process or platform always outperform the previous generation, right? For the same price, usually, they are kind of 10% or up to 40% faster performance, right? So for sure, a lot of our large customers, they want a new generation product. And Supermicro is good for that kind of it's our building cloud solution. Traditionally, we always introduce new technology to market a few months or a few quarter earlier than others. So this time, we have that advantage again. And other than the market grows, indeed because we have better solution, or better service, better quality, so indeed, we are gaining much share from others as well. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And I guess maybe dovetailing off some of the earlier questions around industry kind of supply chain alignment and juggling through kind of the COVID challenges that you've had. How would you characterize the component supply chain or component availability that you see in the market today? There's been some indications that certain areas have been tight or even constrained. What's your current outlook? Have you seen any constraints? And what are you expecting if you're willing to look out over the next couple of quarters? Charles Liang : Yes. We saw a lot of constraints across almost all different kind of components. So we have been very carefully engaged with our partner and have a forecast, have a kind of a contract. So logistic costs also increased, lead time also increased. But with our contract and relationship, at this moment, I feel there are a lot of challenges, but we should be safe for our smooth growth. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Yes. And then the final question I just wanted to ask was that I know a couple of years ago, you did have a customer that had accounted for 10% of revenue. Do you think that with these new larger data center win opportunities that sound like they're going to ramp over the next couple of quarters, do you think you'll have a situation where you have a 10% customer in the future or not? Charles Liang : Hard to say, hard to say. But we try to have many more customer because our customer base was still small compared with our long-term goal. So with now a much bigger capacity, so we are able to engage with many more partners. So I believe that question yes or no, it will happen. It's happy to have -- it will not happen, it's also happy to be more diversified. So I'm pretty neutral attitude for that and look at where it seems will be under managed. Operator : We have your next question from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Securities. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. So I am actually particularly impressed with the guidance given that at the September quarter call, you guys had indicated an expectation that I think Ice Lake would become generally available for several OEM launch by early 2021. That hasn't happened yet. And that looks like it's going to be more of a 2Q '21 type of event now at this point in time. So given that context, does that mean that the rest of your business has significantly strengthened relative to what you thought would be the case back at the 3Q '20 call? Charles Liang : Yes. As -- I guess, Supermicro a have much more diversified product line now and also customer base in terms of vertical, in terms of many more customers. So we are a much more diversified customer -- a diversified company now. And with our extension to Taiwan and also our capacity growth in U.S.A., we are ready to be a much bigger size content. Nehal Chokshi : Great. And speaking to that much greater diversity and exposures, can you give us a sense as to what is your exposure to some of these faster-growing parts of the market that you're addressing? Charles Liang : Yes. For example, telco 5G, we did not focus on that market before. But since about 2 years ago, we start to focus on this market, and we're already engaged with some very good partner globally. And for example, a large data center and OEM, we did not really focus on that segment in the last 10 years. But about 12 months ago or 18 months ago, we started to engage with some, and we have a good achievement. Also for IoT, we continue to extend our IoT product line. So Supermicro indeed likes to be a much more diversified, much service customer as a one-stop shopping company partner. Nehal Chokshi : So would it be fair to say that these 3 areas that you just highlighted represent maybe 30% of revenue now? Charles Liang : We did not see that specifically. But that's why, we just mentioned, Supermicro is great to grow company to be a $10 billion revenue company in the near future. And in our investor event, we will share more detail about that. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please continue. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and looking forward to meeting you next quarter. Have a nice day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now like to turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles Liang : Thank you. Nico and good afternoon everyone. Last quarter, we have performed, our growth strategy well, by winning new key customers extended our global operation and introduced a whole new generation of hotels. We have released our fiscal 2021, third quarter financial results. Let's take a look at some highlights. Our fiscal third quarter net sales totaled $896 million, up 16% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. For the first time in our company history since IPO, the revenue from seasonally-weak March quarter significantly surpassed that of the December quarter. Our fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, above the midpoint of our previously guided range of $0.37 to $0.57. In this quarter, we also generated a record revenue from the Asia Pacific region, demonstrating our continued and expanding traction in Asia. We continue to execute our three-year growth strategy highlighted in our recent investor update on March 4th. Our progress, judged by historical industry growth rates, has propelled us to resume the position of the fastest growing U.S.-based server/storage manufacturer. More importantly, we achieved all this despite so much of our focus having been on growing the company's long-term foundation. Earlier this quarter, we introduced the industry's most comprehensive server portfolio leveraging the latest processors from both Intel and AMD. Our application-optimized solutions are gaining traction among the world's most advanced datacenters and enterprises. We have several committed early ship customers that have deployed thousands of server units, led by our SuperBlade. We also seed out optimized systems for many verticals such as artificial intelligence, telco, cloud and more. One successful example is our collaboration with Osaka University in Japan with our liquid-cooled HPC solution, which takes full advantage of the new powerful Ice Lake processors. Hundreds of other customers have already utilized our early sampling program or accessed the new systems online through our JumpStart program. These activities should accelerate the deployment ramp of this new generation of products and propel growth for this calendar year. In addition to the systems based on the new CPUs, we released an innovative new GPU system architecture last quarter with resource savings in mind. With very strong global demand, the optimized 2U 2-node GPU solution delivers great cost savings, utilizing shared power and cooling. This 2U 2-node system supports 3 double-width or 6 single-width PCIe Gen-4 GPUs, and is the best platform for video streaming, high-end cloud gaming, and countless social networking applications. We have been executing a robust manufacturing plan in Taiwan for a few years. With attractive new product lines and strong customer demand, we recognize the importance of optimizing operational efficiency and reducing cost, especially with a tighter supply chain. As one of the key elements of our strategy, our Taiwan campus expansion will increase our capacity and capabilities in production, operation, engineering, and sales to deliver more cost-optimized offerings. Manufacturing cost has been our painful challenge since company was founded 27 years ago. Now with the new 1 million square feet of manufacturing and office space added to our Taiwan campus this summer, we will become more profitable by having more control over our global supply chain and manufacturing cost. The U.S. campus expansion, which will be online shortly after the completion of the Taiwan expansion, will focus on similar operational goals but with more emphasis on security and Made-In-U.S.A. initiatives. Again, these expansions will position us well to handle the ongoing logistics challenge and rising costs while further improving our time-to-market advantages and production scale and agility. We are making progress in the key growth factors I mentioned in our recent investor event, and we are getting great traction within the critical segment of Cloud Datacenter and Enterprise accounts. We are securing new design wins and seeing expanded orders from certain high-profile customers. These customers are choosing Super Micro based on the breadth of our portfolio and our ability to deliver the best optimized system for their 5G, Telco, AI, and both public and private cloud workloads. We have been efficiently growing our high-profile accounts worldwide, and we aim to double these accounts in the coming years. Our high-profile customer initiative is a big portion of our greater organic growth strategy that has evolved and been fine-tuned over time. We also continue our sales transformation effort by broadly launch our B2B/B2C automation with the auto-configurator tool, which is already in use with many selected customers. This tool will make it much easier to share communication, technical data and product configurations among our sales, engineers, and customers, which I believe will accelerate revenue and reduce fulfillment time and cost. Strong positive momentum is building again at Super Micro. I believe our Q3 growth is just the beginning of our journey to gain more market share again. We are returning to our hallmark of consistent growth. To align my interest with the company's growth strategy, the board of directors accepted the proposal of reducing my annual salary to $1 and added an equity compensation package tied to very aggressive revenue and stock price targets. Also in our recent investor update, I talked about our path to $10 billion in annual sales in 3 to 6 years. Now I have even stronger confidence to achieve this goal. Over the past year, Super Micro has had successes in various market segments such as Storage, HCI, Cloud, AI, Machine Learning, 5G/Telco and others. We have established our technology leadership through optimized server and storage solutions. I am excited that our recent booking activities, along with our capacity expansion initiatives and improving COVID outlook give us the confidence to provide a strong Q4 guidance. Our coming fiscal Q4 revenue should surpass $1 billion, in the range of $980 million to $1.08 billion. Super Micro is finally back on track for growth, and I am confident that our growth rate will be getting faster and faster in the coming quarters and years. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Since moving to the CFO role at Super Micro last quarter, I am even more excited about the future of the company than when I joined in 2018. We continued to execute in all major areas of the company this quarter and are pleased with our results and outlook. Our fiscal third quarter revenue totaled $896 million. This reflects a 16% year-on-year increase from the same quarter of last year and an 8% increase from the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Systems comprised 77% of total revenue and the volume of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs also increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. Geographic performance was strong across all major geographies. On a year-on-year basis, the U.S. increased 18%, Asia increased 29%, and Europe increased 3%, Rest of World decreased 12%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales increased 8% quarter-on-quarter, Asia increased 28%, and Europe increased 5%, Rest of World decreased 46%. From a customer point of view, we saw increases in sales to large data center and AI customers. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. So working down the P&L, Q3 gross margin was 13.8%, down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. In our February earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to decline approximately 120 to 160 basis points sequentially due to the lack of a Q2 discrete cost recovery of that and product mix. Due to high demand in our -- for our products and in our supply chain, we incurred higher transportation and other additional costs. I will further address this in the outlook, as we do expect some of these cost headwinds to abate in the coming quarter. Turning to operating expenses, Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter and decreased 10% year-on-year to $106 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 6% quarter-on-quarter and increased 9% year-on-year to $95 million. Recall, last year operating expenses were offset by $9.5 million related to a joint product development related settlement fee, but after removing this benefit Q3 OpEx would have been down 1% year-on-year. As outlined on the February earnings call, the sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to higher payroll taxes and increased R&D product development costs due to heightened new product activity from Ice lakes products from Intel, the Milan product from AMD and A100 products from Nvidia. Other income & expense including interest expense was a $1.4 million gain as compared to a $3.1 million loss last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter our tax gain was a $0.2 million so on, $0.2 million on a GAAP basis, and an expense of $2.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.6% for the quarter. Lastly, our joint venture incurred a loss of $0.3 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $1.5 million last quarter. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.50 as compared to $0.63 in Q2 of fiscal 2021 and $0.84 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow used in operations totaled $124 million compared to cash flow from operations of $63 million in Q2. CapEx totaled $19 million resulting in free cash flow used of $144 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and receivables, as well as capital return to stockholders through $43 million in share repurchases. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $179 million, while bank debt was $85 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $94 million. Turning to working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 86 days, that's down from 92 days, and within our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory increased, days of inventory at 99 decreased. Days sales outstanding was 37 days while days payables outstanding totaled 50 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, 2021 in a range of $980 million to $1.08 billion. We expect gross margins to increase approximately 70 basis points sequentially, due to both product mix and improved management of our supply chain costs. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $108 million and include $7 million in stock option compensation expenses and $2 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect our Non-GAAP operating expenses to be up modestly quarter-over-quarter driven by lower NRE and continued investment in R&D with the rollout of new product activity from AMD, Intel and Nvidia previously mentioned. We expect our non-GAAP Q4 tax rate to be approximately 13% and approximately 16% thereafter. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $1.0 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. We expect fully diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.77 and fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.90. We expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million inclusive of our ongoing Taiwan building project. As Nicole, will turn it back over to you for Q&A. Nicole Noutsios : Operator, we can start with questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : A couple of follow-ups. I am just trying to better understand as you look into the second half, especially given your strong revenue guide for the June quarter. How do you see momentum into September and December quarter and how do you see some of the demand drivers like new servers, CPU and other cloud, or data center related drivers impacting your revenues into the second half and I have a follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes, I mean, as you know, we had spent a local for April to engage high profile accounts in last 3 months and I'd like to share we see it as we achieved an achievement. So now we grow a lot of high profile account and those account, lots of them start August and that's why we see March, we already have a strong quarter and then Q1 until our June quarter we are very strong, would it be the first time over $1 billion. In September, Steel, we see that pipeline is strong as well. Shortage, we will soon reach our, kind of a long-term pattern very closely and the shelter in this situation continue to be very tough, but as of today, our home is, the home is from our vendors have been praising you good. So I feel pretty comfortable, although there are strategy everywhere. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And in that context, how do you see increasing in commodity prices for instance, storage and DRAM impacting your margin profile into the second half. Charles Liang : For most account indeed our customer happy to accept the higher price basically chip what has been healthy margin and viable pay course, we pay most of the customer happy to expect because it's kind of surprise basically. So we were to valuable customers will negotiate, based condition, for our sale for our customer but this year, most of the Spain. And we expect that close. Mehdi Hosseini : Just a quick follow-up. Have you been able to build a strategic inventory so that you would benefit from lower cost, as you think about the, as you think about the shipment over the next, let's say six months or do you have to continue to buy higher cost inventory and then you would pass on that incremental cost of the customer? Charles Liang : Well this is difficult question. Indeed we happen maturity, we have since many months ago. So yes, you are right, we had increased our inventory since I would say three months, potentially ago. So we have been lacking in that area, but still our inventory limited. We saw growing very strong demand, very soon. I mean, we had to kind of our pay higher for our newly entered this year. Operator : Your next question is from Ananda Baruah. Ananda Baruah : Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results and I'm putting them up just after you've done the analyst event. So and that's pretty exciting to see. I guess a couple of follow-one to the direction that Mehdi was kind of asking questions could you give a little, a little more context in the key vertical areas where you're seeing the most pronounced order pick options and I guess kind of, off the top of my head, I'm thinking, hyperscale cloud customers versus large enterprise customers like on premise and also the carriers for 5G and I know there's new activity going on in all of in each of the buckets. But just interested in getting context to where you're seeing the most pronounced pickup, appreciate it. And I have a further follow up or two. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yes, thank you. Yes, it is. Again, we have been growing well in our 5G and telco. So we saw dip in some volume in March quarter and we have a more and more telco 5G customer continued to engage or start to grow didn't have their demand, not a very good time to us. And that part of our remedy well. Other than that, you know, kind of a mega price and the senior contact very prevalent for other medical improvement. We also again some good traction there and high performance account especially private cloud and some HPC especially, HPC with new isolate in Milan in Nvidia new GPU that consume much more power than before and not by dip coding, had been we come out of as well. So it's cloud service is also for HPC customer with our very optimize dip coding solutions. Ananda Baruah : And Charles in your prepared remarks, you imagine accelerating revenue growth, I think you said in the coming quarters. As well as kind of in the coming years as I guess coming quarters, I don't want to pin you down too much, but should we expect, can that occur over the next four quarters and how much I guess, do you have, it is a situation where you think like timeline next, let's say, four quarters do you feel like you have the account traction currently to do that or does that involve new account. Ananda Baruah : Or sort of new penetration conversations inside of existing accounts that have yet to occur. Charles Liang : Beneath IP, we sort our existing account are growing their demand. And that's why we have extend our capacity, especially in Asia quickly and with higher very high scale so also we are again engaged in a have lots of high-profile counting in your mines and those are going to start order and we will continue engage those high-profile accounts. We have enhanced our sales team including our B2B automation system that we are here, and all cut into sales. So our sales inputs more high-profile account now. So I too believe very strongly that there also have speeding up quarter-after-quarter and year-over-year. Ananda Baruah : And last one for me, is it July, if I am remembering accurately June, that the new Taiwan center is opening up for production. Charles Liang : June or July we do not final yet, it can be either way, it kind of depends on situation. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Jonathan Tanwanteng. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Hi guys. Thank you for taking the questions and very nice quarter and nice to see that demand out there. My first question is what kind of gross margins do you think you can get in the September quarter and I know there's a lot of moving parts but, especially given the inflationary environment, you your new facility coming online which should lower your costs. You have the new sales tools, which improve your efficiency, I think you alluded also that you're burning through your strategic inventory lower costs, so I'm just wondering with all the puts and takes, do you thinking you can improve from the quarter into the September quarter and beyond that. Charles Liang : Yes. I can say I did feel you and tell you the part of detail, I mean the March quarter, we have a lot of product ship by air because our satisfaction have been parity. So you ship by air and a lot of buyer speak of propulsion from our vendors. So we faced some overhead there for March quarter and looking forward for September situation would have been much improved. David, you can add something? David Weigand : Yes, so as Jon, as we mentioned the ASPs are up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So we were looking forward to improving our margins toward us as we outlined back on March 4th of 14% to 17%. So I think that's our general guidance. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Okay, great, thank you for that and David, can you actually talk about your expected -- your expectations on cash flow, as we get through the next couple of quarters, I know you used a lot this quarter types of these buybacks as well, but as demand ramps. Do you see yourself using more cash, or do you think you alone, you've collect some of that back. Just your general thoughts. David Weigand : Sure. That's a good question. We because we returned $43 million back to the shareholders this quarter, in addition to growing accounts receivable and inventory. And so, and also continuing our capital improvements in Taiwan. So as we complete our build-out in Taiwan. The cash demands will abate over there and also we've already grown our inventory now to over $900 million. And so, we expect that the growth rate of inventory is not going to be the same as it was during this quarter. So this quarter was especially demanding because we had such a -- we had such high demand. And so we don't, the rate of acceleration will not be the same. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Do you think you'll be cash flow positive in the next quarter or after I guess something that there in Taiwan. David Weigand : Yes, it's going to depend on, it's going to depend on our growth and so that's really what it comes down to is how is -- if we go. If we exceed our growth target. Charles Liang : We will stop of buying the stock back for this quarter that region is because our business, we have got our base strong and we need more cash flow to prepare inventory, Jonathan Tanwanteng : Got it. Good problem to have. Last one from me, I think on Intel mentioned a bit more digestion in data center. Are you seeing that at all in your Intel product lineup, and if you are, is it your products the AMD's, AMD videos that are driving the strength that you're seeing going forward? Charles Liang : You're are right over, we have a customer kind of require for Intel CPU, AMD CPU and NVIDIA GPU. So as it is moment we feel, it's hopefully a strong demand and also see some, the price changes as well this year. Operator : Your next question is from Nehal Chokshi. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Congratulations on the strong results here. It's not like the drivers of the 8% be rinelative to midpoint guidance was the new customers equally between cloud apps and the customers and AI. Do these new customers come with the new products or is it using existing products. Charles Liang : It's a combination. We have a lot of customer need new GPUs solution from Nidia, so now the Nvidia GPU has done is I say, some in the lag. So yes, most of the girls I believe with new our new product but even existing product we see a strong demand the whole limitation is kind of a shortage, so we are working very hard to improve our situation. Nehal Chokshi : What about demand on the storage heavy side of things. Nextgen storage and JBOF storage. Charles Liang : I would like to say not to us, not hard as AI and 5G careful but still we see us some demand. Nehal Chokshi : But then I think there, there's been a lot of discussion during the call about price inputs and that's been an issue for a lot of companies out there. It sounds like you guys have been able to skirt that issue. Just to be clear, is it because of the strategic inventory reserves or is it because there has been a more favorable pricing environment. So you can pass on these input price increases to your customers. Charles Liang : First, I mean that we have a long-term contract and relationship with our supplier that happen as people with cost or kind of most or at least a stable and yes, most of the plasma also except our case through the cost so in both situation I feel we are in good condition. Nehal Chokshi : And is that what underpins the confidence and gross margin will tick back up in the June quarter. Charles Liang : Now, gross margin pretty much because of shipping charge. It's basically some ship of the year. As you know, how the COVID-19, the ship by air cost grew about got triple, and they will not be there but in that few quarter that is the situation and also because of demand strong, so we have the production and we, in some case we had to pay extra to our vendors to our own delivery. Operator : I'm showing no further question at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to the company for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Liang : Thank you, everyone for listening us today and have a good one. See you next time. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and CEO. Charles? Charles Liang : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to announce that for the first time our quarterly revenue has exceeded $1 billion. For fiscal Q4 2021, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 19.3%. For the whole fiscal year 2021, our revenue grew 6.5%. We have gained market share and finally resumed fast growth starting from March quarter this year, after the impact from the past 10-K delay and COVID19 challenges. The revenue growth was driven by some wins from large enterprise customers and large multi-nation high-tech companies. These customers choose Super Micro because of our green computing technology, faster time-to-market, and plug-and-play total IT solutions, especially in appliance, Cloud, AI and 5G markets. Now, let\u2019s look at some key highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal fourth-quarter net sales totaled $1.07 billion, up 19.3%, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, at the top end of our guidance range. This growth rate, I believe, is much higher than that of the industry. All our major geographies contributed double-digit year-over-year quarterly growth. Our fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.81, up from $0.68 same period last year. We saw a significant increase in sales from new and existing large, high-profile customers. Our strong momentum is mainly driven by our business expansion from hardware solution to total IT solution that consists of hardware, software, and services. We have doubled our software engineering resources in the past 24 months to allow us to swiftly execute this plan. Through engagement and close collaboration with strategic leading hardware and software partners, we have provided our customers fully optimized, tested, certified, and ready-to-deploy reference architectures. As a result, large volume orders are deployed timely without customers\u2019 having to go through complicated processes of hardware validation, software compatibility, and supply chain disruption. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. Earlier in fiscal Q4, we successfully executed the launch of Intel Ice Lake, AMD Milan and NVIDIA A100 GPU based product lines and began to ship more than 200 application-optimized product solutions. They are all based on the strong foundation of our Server Building Block Solution. These optimized systems are created in-house, leveraging close to three decades of subsystem innovations, including motherboards, enclosures, power supplies, and cooling technologies. What\u2019s more, our security and management software empower customers to deploy, manage and scale in a timely manner from enterprises to hyperscalers. On the product side, our new Ice Lake-based X12 generation multi-node solutions have gained great tractions among customers who are looking to scale out their enterprise and cloud datacenters. From SuperBlade, MicroBlade to BigTwin, FatTwin and the upcoming GrandTwin, all these resource-saving product lines support dense NVMe and Optane persistent memory, flexible GPU and FPGA configurations, providing optimal performance and the best TCO to a variety of customer workloads. Our GPU product lines are continuing their strong growth with the explosion of AI/ML application demands. These new Ice Lake and Milan-based GPU product lines support larger on-GPU memory and accelerate compute intensive applications. Our 2U 2-node GPU system has proven to be a top-seller since its introduction, thanks to its optimal mix of CPU-to-GPU ratio and resource-saving features. Later this year, we\u2019ll be introducing a brand-new Universal GPU product line that will provide even more flexible configurations for many different CPU and GPU modules combination, further push the limit of system density and performance up to 50% when compared to competition. Announced in June during Computex 2021, the Plug & Play Rack product line is an integral part of our complete solution strategy going forward. These turn-key racks have undergone a thorough, solution level design and validation process and built securely for our AI, 5G/Telco, enterprise, cloud, and storage customers. Upon receiving these total IT solutions, customers only need to connect power and networking, then they are immediately ready to run their applications, shortening the time from making decisions to seeing results. To further improve sales and operations efficiency, we will launch our auto-configurator tool to enable B2B/B2C automation, which will be broadly ready to service our customers in the coming few weeks. This tool makes it faster to achieve product optimization and more efficient to leverage configurations among our sales, engineers, and customers. We recently completed our Taiwan campus expansion. Now with the total 3 million square feet campus in Taiwan, we are equipped to deliver not only sufficient capacity, supply chain resilience, but also lower cost structure. Combined with manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley and the Netherlands, Super Micro is well positioned to grow market share with economy of scale, agility, quality and rapid delivery time. To satisfy our customers' fast-growing demands, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to mitigate critical parts shortage. In summary, Super Micro has been solidly transforming into a total IT solution company from a server hardware company. In addition to providing the greenest hardware total solution, our software and service products are now ready for large enterprise, cloud, AI and Telco customers. Second, our Taiwan campus expansion doubles our solution capacity and lowers our cost structure. Now if we decide to do so, we can start to reduce our expense in Silicon Valley HQ. Third, our business automation program, including the auto-configurator and B2B/B2C systems, will significantly improve customer experience by streamlining customer configuration and order process, resulting in shortened solution delivery time with better quality and optimization. With that as a summary, I believe our fiscal year 2022 revenue will reach at least $4.3 billion and start to grow much faster than our past four years. In closing, I am pleased with the progress of our business transformation, which has started to speed up our business execution in fiscal '21. As a total IT solution company, we are now able to grow business much more efficiently and achieve our $10 billion of revenue goal quicker, perhaps we are able pull in from 2026 to 2025 or even sooner. With that, I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. We continued to accelerate in all major areas of the company and exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Growth was driven by wins from large enterprise customers and key high-tech companies worldwide, continued strength across all major geographies and solid demand for our products and services. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenue totaled $1.07 billion, reflecting a 19% increase both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. Looking at Super Micro's Q4 revenue in our three market verticals, we achieved $672 million in organic enterprise and channel AI and machine learning vertical, $366 million in OEM and large data center vertical, and $31 million in 5G/Telco and Edge/IoT vertical. Systems comprised 78% of total revenue and the volume of systems shipped was up year-over-year, while the nodes shipped were down year-over-year. System ASPs increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. Performance was strong across all major geographies this quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia increased 25%, U.S. increased 21%, and Europe increased 13%, while Rest of World decreased 3%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales increased 30%, Europe increased 14%, Asia decreased 1%, and Rest of World increased 7%. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, the Q4 gross margin was 13.7%, down 30 basis points year-on-year and 10 basis points quarter-on-quarter. We expected our Q4 gross margin to improve 70 basis points due to discreet costs incurred in Q3. As expected, those costs did not repeat in Q4, however expedite fees and shipping costs increased by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As reported by many other companies around the world, supply chain pressures related to the resurgence of variants of COVID-19 persist. Turning to operating expenses, Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter and decreased 7% year-on-year to $106 million. The decrease year-on-year was caused by a decrease in incentive bonuses, offset by higher headcount this year, primarily in R&D. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and increased 9% year-on-year to $99 million. The quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year increases were related to headcount and other personnel costs as we continue to invest in human capital to address our growth opportunities. Other income and expense including interest expense which was a $2.1 million loss as compared to a $1.4 million gain last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter our tax benefit was $1.6 million on a GAAP basis and an expense of $1.8 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 4% for the quarter. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.6 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $0.3 million last quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.81 as compared to $0.50 in Q3 of fiscal 2021 and $0.68 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations totaled $64 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $124 million in Q3. CapEx totaled $13 million resulting in free cash flow of $50 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and receivables while key providers of cash included an increase of $144 million in accounts payable and $12 million in deferred revenues. The increase in deferred revenue was due to higher sales of our service contracts. We also used $12 million to repurchase shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $232 million, while bank debt was $98 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $134 million. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q4 cash conversion cycle was 80 days, which from down from 86 day in Q3, beating our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory increased, days of inventory at 96 days decreased. Days Sales Outstanding was 37 days while Days Payables Outstanding totaled 53 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales in a range of $900 million to $980 million, which resulted in GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.16 to $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.28 to $0.48 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 which ends September 30, 2021. We expect gross margins to remain at similar levels sequentially, with upside potential as we manage supply chain costs and maintain price discipline. Over the upcoming quarters, we expect to achieve margins within our target model as we further scale our Taiwan operations and begin to gain traction from our new product offerings and auto configurator B2B and B2C solutions. GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be approximately $110 million and include $7 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D, lower NRE expected and higher personnel costs. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 53.7 million shares for GAAP and 55.0 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of taxes, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect net sales in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $2.60 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3 for fiscal year 2022 which ends June 30, 2022. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 55.3 million shares for GAAP and 56.5 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of taxes, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 of approximately $14 to $16 million. Nicole, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I had a couple follow-ups if I was to take the midpoint of guide range for fiscal year 2022. It seems like maybe there is a little bit of a, leverage in operating profit in other words, maybe a 200 basis points of improvement to get $3 of earnings. What I want to understand is, what are the key assumptions for component costs is this a base case or very conservative case? And I have a follow-up to that? Charles Liang : I would rather say, it\u2019s based on conservative base because supply chain continued to very tight. And although we have a good relationship with all, of our supplier but anyway its global incentive program so it\u2019s a conservative base, but because our operation now is able to genetically expanded to Taiwan so - well though overall cost. Mehdi Hosseini : Right so where is the most - what segment of the supply chain you're experiencing the most shortage? What are the key components that you're relatively have - the most difficult time procuring? Charles Liang : IC chip especially IO chip. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And question on the cash flow what was the depreciation, amortization for the reported June quarter and what should be assume for fiscal year 2022? Charles Liang : I\u2019ll get back to Mehdi on this. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Given the CapEx growth in fiscal year 2021 on the $60 million and the buildup of the Taiwan facility, should we expect CapEx to moderate from here? Charles Liang : Absolutely, yes because our Taiwan operation is pretty much ready we add about 200 staff in Taiwan in last year month and all the people have been well trained. And they just moved into the new building last month. Other than that, now free information as we just mentioned for B2B/B2C and order comes later. We hire people and same people and they are about always and start to offer our service to certain customer. And we will over the year apply to all the customer in the next few weeks. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay great. So I\u2019ll get back in queue? Charles Liang : My investment, have been there\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : So Charles, are you implying that the CapEx should decline in fiscal 2022? Charles Liang : Maybe because we are growing I mean, 2022/2023/2024 we expect continue to grow so I guess the operation expense won\u2019t shrink it may grow very kind of consistent - very limited growth because we already invested there. Operator : Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes thank you and congratulations on strong results especially the free cash flow we\u2019re expecting a drain based on this commentary for last quarter and enjoy very nice free cash. It\u2019s looks like the big delta relative to our expectation with an increasing base payable and given this environment of trained component environment. I mean, how is it pulled off basically? David Weigand : So now we did have a lot of inventory that came at the near end of the quarter. And so that's what caused accounts payable to rise and with a result in rise in DTO. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Charles Liang : And now I can see there is a positive so keep kind of high inventory because we strongly believe customer needed those products. Charles Liang : And so by the yes\u2026. Nehal Chokshi : Go ahead sorry please? Charles Liang : All right, you can tell from our forecasts from our revenue forecast that our sales are not dipping as they traditionally do in Q1. And so therefore, we needed to have more inventory on hand, which was why, I alluded to the challenges of cash flow for this projecting cash flow for Q4. But we ended up in a good position. Nehal Chokshi : I see so I guess because we built up the inventory, at the end of the quarter you\u2019re satisfied a strong demand, you're seeing the September quarter and the balance sheet is showing up as increased base payable. But what you're saying is that base payable terms actually didn't increase, this is simply the timing of which you received the inventory. Charles Liang : That's exactly right. Nehal Chokshi : Got it okay understood okay. And I don't recall last time you gave full-year guidance. I'm not sure if you have before, but certainly I don't think you did during fiscal year 2021 or fiscal year 2020, or past few years, one year in 10-K filing delay held. So what has changed to give you visibility guide on the full year basis, and importantly, almost 10% of that the consensus estimate? Charles Liang : Not much reason, but pretty much because we have a successful expansion in Taiwan, and also are build in business automation, including the auto congregator and B2B, B2C tool. And also a company expanding from a hardware solution company to total IT solution company. So we saw it\u2019s a good idea to open the market, kind of more completed picture for a whole year and for the future. Nehal Chokshi : Okay all right. And this midpoint 20% growth guidance for fiscal year 2022 is this tied to any sort of - and server industry growth expectation? Charles Liang : I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question is it tied to what? Nehal Chokshi : Is it tied to server industry growth any sort of server industry growth expectation or is it independent of server industry growth? Charles Liang : Not quite, not quite. As we mentioned, we had returned to faster growth faster in other model. If you remember, before 2017, we were attending delays our growth always had been two times to four times faster than our industry. And we believe we are returned to the faster growth being this model. So start from March and June last quarter, we start to outperform in our industry. And I believe we will start to outperform in our industry growth rate maybe double or triple or even more, looking forward. So we are very much here in the lower. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, undoubtedly, clearly but is there a particular industry growth rate that you are expecting an urge I got 20% year-over-year 5%, 10%, 2% share your thoughts on that? Charles Liang : We believe our industry may grow 5% to 10% and our growth it should be a double to our people over there operate. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. And then my final question, is that the minimum $3 per share? Does that correspond to the low end of the revenue guidance, or to the midpoint of revenue guidance? Charles Liang : I rather say it\u2019s a conservative number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong revenue execution and the visibility to put out a long-term word of fiscal year rough guide here? I guess a couple from me if I could, David, could you just walk back through the components that you spoke to on gross margin? I just want to make sure that I'm straight on those. And then I have a quick follow up as well. David Weigand : Certainly, so when we finished last quarter at, you know at 13.8, we had some about 70 basis points of discrete costs, and which included some assumption costs as well. But mainly, it was principally streets and discrete costs that we didn't expect to occur. So this quarter, those did not occur. But we did have 50 basis points more of a shipping costs. And it was it was really caused by our directed effort to deliver product to our customers on time. And that\u2019s what our customers expect and demand. So that\u2019s really the reason that we were not able to raise margin occur. Just because these\u2026 Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s cool. And so if you lost the 70 to that 13 to 13.1%, and then I got it and then you - sorry, you lost 70 and you gained 70 so that will take you to 14.5% or so, and then you had 50 more so that took you to - about to take you back down to 14%. And then was there, I think I\u2019m doing that math right. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. And then was there an incremental 30 basis point headwind that brought it down to the 13.7%? David Weigand : Well, there was. We had two things. One, we had deferred revenue that we added to our balance sheet of about $12 million. So we had to carve-out some income for our services. And we also had, just the rest was just product mix and\u2026 Ananda Baruah : Got it. Okay. And then, like how should we - what are sort of the pushes and the pulls? You may mentioned it in the prepared remarks that you expect in the coming quarters to move up into the 14% to 17% range. What are the pushes and pulls there? And if there\u2019s any way to give them by order of magnitude, that would be helpful also. David Weigand : Sure, absolutely. So, we realized that with the Delta variant, it\u2019s hard to say that COVID is over. And so therefore, we expect to continue to have challenges on supply chain shipping costs. However, we do expect our other initiatives such as our transition over to Taiwan and our new product offerings, and especially in those verticals that have attractive - more attractive gross margins, as well as our B2B and B2C configurator. We expected benefit of those things to start to come to the business in the upcoming quarters. So in the short run, we know that Taiwan has gone online. However, it's going to take a couple quarters to start to realize benefits. Ananda Baruah : Any - can we - I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one intrigued about this. Any chance you get you to give us some sense of - for fiscal 2022 what the gross margin could look like? Charles Liang : So we\u2019ve given guidance on the top line and the bottom line. But we're not going - other than the fact that we expect gross margins to improve, we're not giving further guidance. Ananda Baruah : I got it. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that you would be in the range by the end of the year \u2013 end of fiscal\u2026 Charles Liang : Yes. Our target is to go - and I think this is in the notes. Our target is to be back within our range during the year. Ananda Baruah : Our range? Charles Liang : Yes, our range by the way was 14% to 17%. Yes. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Appreciate it. I'll get back in the queue here. I appreciate it. That's really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I\u2019m just curious as the industry and not just you guys, but the industry in whole deals with supply chain shortages, semiconductor, IC shortages, et cetera. I\u2019m curious on your side of the business. Have you been able to invoke your own customers to provide you with extended lead times and has that provided you with better visibility? And then on the heels of that kind of tied to that question is, is the guidance for this current quarter assuming that you would have actually outperformed that number if you were able to get all of that - all of the supply to meet demand? Put it another way, are you able to meet demand as you see it in the current quarter? Charles Liang : Very good question. Again, although it\u2019s highly whatever possible we could, but still, we cannot get however we want. So we cannot shift all our demand to our customer. But I wanted to say, we can shift most of that, maybe customers still had weighted longer than regular time. And the going we have a loss of repeat customer, older customer. So they understand the global difficulty, so a longer lead times is people don\u2019t like to see that, but basically they are cooperative. So we cannot shift wider customer need, but basically customer happy with our physical service. Aaron Rakers : And what is your current view of expectations of when that normalizes? Does your fiscal 2022 guidance reflect a view that the tightness in the semiconductor supply chain starts to normalize through this fiscal year or do you think it\u2019s out further than that? Just curious of what your thoughts are? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, as I shared before and now, traditionally, our growth story was double to quadruple faster than our industry. And I believe we already get back from that momentum. Double to quadruple faster than our industry. Now because of that the global shortage, that impact our growth a little bit for sure. And that\u2019s why we are humbled to stay maybe $4.3 billion even now because of big shortage equivocally. I believe our growth will be a much better than that. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And then the final quick question is, there is a lot of architectural things going on in the server and the universe around semiconductors and so on. I\u2019m curious of how - what kind of growth that you\u2019re seeing in GPU accelerated server platforms. Do you think that there is a longer term narrative that we\u2019re at the point where actually the richness of the server configurations can really drive a positive upward trend and blended ASPs for foreseeable future. I\u2019m just curious to how you\u2019re seeing compute architectures evolve that maybe benefits you guys from a growth perspective? Charles Liang : Yes. As a technology company based on Silicon Valley, we like technical challenge. We like new tech knowledge. That\u2019s why a lots different CPU, a lots of different GPU, a lots of different platform, not to a big trends to us. And that\u2019s why I just mentioned, we will introduce Grand Twin a brand new architecture to the market very soon. And we also examining a universal GPU platform and that will be ready by end of this year. So all of those is to provide the much more flexible kind of support on multiple different CPUs, vendor, multiple different GPU vendor, and different form factor. So all the platform we think will benefit our customers. And thank you to our building for solution, we are able to kind of optimize architecture and especially Grand Twin and kind of universal GPU solution. So we are very happy - really excited to see the opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Good afternoon, guys, and great quarter and also the outlook is pretty impressive. I wanted to drill down on the previous just on how you have confidence in that $4.3 billion in revenue. Is that a bottoms up analysis with like qualified customer leads indication of interest? Contracts that may have already been signed or is there more - or that you actually have to go out and get before you can achieve that? I\u2019m wondering how you build to that? Charles Liang : It\u2019s both bottoms up and top down from both direction we see the growth where it will be very strong. Again, it\u2019s not because of global shortage. Our growth should be much better than that. And with better product with our current operation, and with also many more new engaged high profile customer we achieved in the last six months and currently. So we feel pretty optimistic of that. Jon Tanwanteng : And I was going to ask, how do you feel about your ability to pass price through in this environment? You talked about expedited shipping. I know that you were doing airfreight last quarter just to get things to customers on time. I would think that everyone knows at this point that it\u2019s impossible to get things without paying of extra shipping charges. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re running on surcharges or other pricing methods to be able to pass that through the customer. And if so, are they receptive to it? Charles Liang : Very good question and a complicated question too. So we try whenever possible to communicate with the customers. But overall, we have to absorb I would have to say at least 50% of that well maybe plus-50% percent of customer. So we tried to kind of provide a customer very cooperative way. So that we can grow much there as well. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Great. And maybe just one final one on pricing. When do you think you can catch up on pricing just to higher input costs? Is it a quarter or the two? How should we think of the lag time before you\u2019re able to absorb all of that? Charles Liang : Again, it\u2019s a complicated question because all the pandemic the airfreight still going on. So - but once the COVID-19 ends I believe will recover to normal. But before that, we are getting able to pass those overhead actual cost to customers. Likewise, they maybe 50-50 in in last quarter, and we will be getting better, but hopefully COVID-19 problem can be end very soon. So we will get back to normal automatically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open. Jon Lopez : I'm very sorry. That\u2019s great. I had phone trouble. Sorry about that. Thanks, David. So I just have say two, I wanted to come back for a second to the fiscal Q1 guidance and maybe to come out this way. I thought in summer March you made you referenced like not declining in fiscal Q1. But I guess as we calculated actually a bit below your normal seasonal trending pattern and that\u2019s after being pretty comfortably above that pattern in the last two quarter, so both fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. So, I guess my question is one are we looking at those numbers differently than you are maybe just set me through what you meant when you said not declining. And then two, is there any constraint on your revenue guidance relative to component or logistical issues perhaps if you can quantify that? Thanks. David Weigand : Sure. I think that - I think what our range does is a range allow us for the struggles that we faced in the supply chain. So therefore, we feel like we provided a broad enough range that we can overachieve And we can also, but we feel comfortable with that range. Charles Liang : I guess one, the other factor is that because last year COVID-19 reason we didn't adjust the employees\u2019 salary that much. So this year, we have a much bigger salary adjustment for employees. That's why we see Q1, Q2 you may see our expected growth, one of the portion because of salary adjustments, and also Taiwan expansion. So we hire people in Taiwan and train people, but they were ready to contribute to our revenue and profitability. Jon Lopez : Okay, thanks. Yes, I guess that helps a bit. I guess my other question just to come back to the gross margin for a second. So to arrive at this $3 figure the north of $3 figure, especially based on what you're referencing OpEx there Charles, I mean the gross margin does need. I think, to be pretty close to 15%. As we get out of calendar Q3 and into the remainder of your fiscal year? I guess why do you think like, do any of these things feel as though you have line of sight to and ending as we look beyond calendar Q3? And if not, are you committing that you get to $3 some other way, like we rain back on OpEx or just maybe walk us through the interplay between why you might have comfort in the $3 number, if you don't have visibility to some of these logistical issues, or cost issues abating? Charles Liang : David [indiscernible]. David Weigand : Sure, so one of the things that helps our cost structure, again, is the movement of our production over to Taiwan. So that's, we expect that to give us - benefit, as well as the attraction in our new product offerings, which we expect to bring higher margins than the traditional server business. So those are the factors that we have insight into and give us confidence that in spite of, supply chain challenges, which we've managed to meet. And in spite of higher costs, which we you know, in terms of shipping and an air freight, which we've continued to deal with, we still believe that through, price management that we can achieve the margins, which will allow us to deliver the targets that we are forecasting. Charles Liang : Yes, the other way to answer your question more directly is that we explained our growth will be significant in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. And we are very confident to see that happen. But if in case it didn't happen, then that means we have too much resource now. So we may reduce some resources in USA quota. I hope we don't do so, but if we had to we will, and we have that option. So that will reduce our operation close over zero. I hope we don't need to go over that way. Operator : We have a follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Just a quick follow up. I want to get your view on current memory prices. How do you see the trend over the next one or two quarters? And I'm asking you about availability and pricing trends? Charles Liang : Very complicated question, but very good question is how to put in take, as at this moment, we see the availability is getting better than last quarter. So on a price changes should be better than before. And as to when the price will stop growing, or a price were going down. We watch very carefully. So at this moment, no clear date, but at least we feel it\u2019s better than last quarter. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks for the color. I know it\u2019s very difficult to look beyond a couple of months. As you think about your FY '22 revenue guide, how should I think about incremental opportunities there? A lot of AI type projects that hyperscalers are expected to ramp. Do you think your FY '22 revenue guide captures some of them? Or should we wait for FY '23 to have a consistent and more meaningful material contribution? Charles Liang : Good question. I mean for AI, we - the rule we\u2019re very aware in fiscal year 2021. And year 2022, I believe we will continue to grow very well, maybe more than 50%, I hope. Right. And for our telco. Telco is another territory we grew very well last year. And I believe this year 2022 our telco buildings will grow much better than even last year. So last year are still very strong area for us. As to hyperscaler, with our Taiwan operation now is ready. So we have a chance to start to service some hyperscaler customer if we select to. But I believe we will be very selective for some bid of customers, where we can provide a value, we will. Mehdi Hosseini : And Charles, when you talked about AI, does that includes kind of the arm based A6 CPU or do you lump that into the hyperscaler segment? Charles Liang : A very future question. But\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Right. Charles Liang : Yes, we have some - we have some arm design as well. Few customer already prefer arms submission. We have some submission there under the belt. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. So when talk about AI it\u2019s not necessarily an arm based solution it\u2019s more general, right? Charles Liang : Many still are interior in the base -- in NVIDIA. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. But when you referenced hyperscalers that's predominantly arm base solutions? Charles Liang : Not necessarily. I mean, as hyperscale to [indiscernible]. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. All right. Got it. Okay. So we can't really isolate that because perhaps it\u2019s just too early to determine arm base - independent arm base solution, right? Charles Liang : When customer need it, we will be ready. Operator : And for the last question we have a follow-up from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Thanks, guys for the follow-up. Yes. Just wanted to ask any context you could give us how we think about revenue seasonality during fiscal year 2022? Will there be a seasonal pattern or will it be. I mean, there will be a seasonal pattern but will it be different than usual fairly ratable on the year-over-year basis? Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah. As you may know, right, September always now exceeding. So this year no exception, right? Although we have a strong demand but global shortage that major reason that we try to be conservative when we share the number with you for September quarter. Ananda Baruah : And then Charles, through the rest of the year, should we just assume typical seasonality to get to the - into the guidance range? Charles Liang : Yes, basically. But traditionally December and June, always our good quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side to ask questions. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles? Charles Liang : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to announce that our quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion even during a traditional weak September quarter. For fiscal Q1 2022, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth of 35%. We continued to gain market share and are exciting well against \u2013 and executing well against our plan to achieve $10 billion in annual revenue. The revenue growth was driven by strong progress across many key customers with our Total IT Solution strategy. Now, let\u2019s look at some highlights from the quarter. First, our first quarter net revenue totaled $1.03 billion. It\u2019s our second consecutive quarter of $1 billion plus in revenues, up 35% year-on-year and down 3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding our guidance of $900 million to $980 million. Our efforts continue to enable our growth trajectory at multiple times the average industry growth rate. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.58, compared to $0.55 in the same period one year ago and higher than our guidance of $0.28 to $0.48. All our major geographies contributed significant year-over-year growth with the APAC region including Japan doubling Year-over-year. The newly completed Taiwan expansion at Bade is greatly helping our Asia and EMEA growth momentum by providing additional capacity and lowering operational cost. These results show that we remain on track to achieve our $10 billion revenue target as we previously shared. We started our business with the best system building block solutions on the market 28 years ago. After many years of servicing the System Integrators and Value-Added Resellers, we began to offer application-optimized complete systems to direct partners including many appliance partners, OEM and large enterprise accounts. In the past 10 years, we have continued to expand and began our business transition from a hardware solutions company to a Total IT Solutions company that combined hardware, software, service and more features. With application optimized total IT solutions for many vertical markets and a much broader technology footprint today, we are redefining our growth drivers to speed up our growth strategies. First, Sub-system and Components, we will continue to offer server motherboards, enclosures, barebones and accessories to the market to continue help growing our market share. Second, Complete Systems, we will continue to fully focus and expand on growing our complete hardware systems with technologies co-developed with our key partners including Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and others. And third, Total IT Solutions, we are accelerating our broad development of Appliance and Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale Solutions for AI, Machine Learning, Industry Automation, IoT, 5G/Telco and Cloud products. And number four, 5S. We are finally ready to aggressively promote our Software, Service and Switch Product lines. And I will share more about the other two S when they are ready. Our building blocks and completed systems business have been steadily growing over the decades, and they serve as the backbone of our revenue growth. With more enterprise customers and appliance partners engagements, our Rack Scale, Total IT Solutions business is our new major growth focus now. To make our Total IT Solutions a seamless experience for our customers, we have been increasing our R&D resource to focus on many software products, service, and networking for many years. These products, as higher value parts of our Total IT solutions, will be the key to improve our margins and profitability in the coming quarters and years. Our new online auto-configurator together with new B2B program are now driving our business growth more efficiently than ever before. Our innovative new command-center based customer service system have been greatly helping our sales, FAE, PM as well as our key customers. They are dramatically improving our business interactions with customers much faster, much accurate, more optimized and more customer friendly while reducing manpower, human delay and error. Our new intelligent database driven tools are indeed performing much smarter and faster than human efforts in most areas. This automated-intelligent system is servicing our salesforce and customers to their great satisfaction now, and it will be constantly upgrade and update. Our push toward Total IT Solutions is benefiting Super Micro and our customers in multiple ways. Most importantly, our customers will receive higher-quality products that are fully optimized, integrate and validate in-house. For the PnP, Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale products, our customers just need to connect network and power cables. And then relative to run the application. This shrinks their deployment time from many weeks to just a few hours. The Total IT Solutions is also helping Super Micro and our customers to mitigate the impact of the global shortage supply chain disruptions by accurately forecasting, building inventories in scale and prioritizing with our strategic partners. The system building block solution allows us to utilize sets of common sub-systems and components to create, design and deliver first-to-market products with reduced manufacturing and supply chain complexity and risk. This will dramatically improve our customer\u2019s time-to-market, which is critical to their success. The Total IT Solution is indeed a win-win-win proposition for Super Micro, our customers and our supply chain partners. Customers can get a taste of our Total IT Solutions now by signing up for our new JumpStart Program. They can remotely run their software and applications on our customer, preconfigured, pre-validated racks powered by the latest technology from Intel, AMD processors and NVIDIA. We are also providing hosted instances of plug and play Cloud Infrastructure with operating systems and other tools that can be accessed remotely for development and testing. The program will instill more confidence in Super Micro customers as it delivers the convenience, faster time to market, performance optimization, cost savings and security. In summary, Super Micro is rapidly growing and is transforming into a Total IT solution company from a server hardware company. In addition to providing the greenest hardware total solution, our software, switch and service products are now ready for any large enterprise, cloud, AI and Telco customers. We are building on and expanding our successful product and technology leadership. Our new growth factors, including the Total IT Solutions and the fast-growing 5S product lines, are keys to achieving our $10 billion revenue target with higher profitability. And third, replicating our market share success in the U.S. to APAC and EMEA with the completion of our new APAC campus in Taiwan. And fourth, our new Command Center Based Auto configurator and B2B Automation platforms are getting broadly used by customers around the world now, and they are accelerating our market-share gains and customer satisfaction. In closing, I am getting much happier with the progress of our business transformation, which is resulting in an acceleration of our business in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As a Total IT Solutions company, our TAM continues to increase as we invest our resources for growth, and I am optimistic about achieving our $10 billion annual revenue goal in a much sooner schedule. With that, I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail. Thank you. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. We continued to experience diversified growth across our key market verticals, exceeding $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, above the high end of our guidance range. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenues have exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by sales to large enterprise, cloud, AI, and Telco markets, continued strength across all geographies and strong demand for our products and services. Our fiscal first quarter revenue totaled $1.03 billion, reflecting a 35% year-on-year increase and a 3% decrease on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Looking at Super Micro\u2019s Q1 revenue in our three market verticals, we achieved $725 million in the Organic Enterprise and Channel AI/ML vertical, $250 million in the OEM appliance and large data center vertical, and $58 million in the 5G/Telco and Edge/IoT vertical. Systems comprised 82% of total revenue and the volume of systems and nodes shipped were up year-over-year. System node ASPs increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia increased 108% as we saw continued growth with both existing and new customers, Europe increased 60%, U.S. increased 13% and Rest of World increased 6%. On a sequential basis, Asia increased 29%, U.S. sales decreased 14%, Europe decreased 3%, and Rest of World decreased 1%. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, the Q1 gross margin was 13.4%, down 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q4 due to higher freight and supply chain costs as was also reported by many other companies around the world. On a year-over-year basis gross margins were down 370 basis points due to a discrete cost recovery event in Q1 of last year, while also incurring higher freight, supply chain and other costs in Q1 of the fiscal year 2022. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-on-year to $109 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased 7% year-on-year to $101 million. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were driven primarily by higher personnel expenses due to increased headcount, especially in Asia. Other Income & Expense including interest expense was a $0.8 million expense as compared to a $2.1 million expense last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter the tax provision was $3.3 million on a GAAP basis and $6.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.4 million this quarter as compared to $0.6 million last quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.58, which was higher than our mid-point guidance of $0.38 due to higher revenues, and lower operating expenses, offset by lower gross margins. Cash flow used in operations was $134.6 million compared to cash flow generated from operations of $63.6 million in Q4 as we built inventory ahead of a seasonally strong December quarter and positioned ourselves to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. CapEx totaled $11.9 million resulting in free cash flow consumption of $146.5 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory, payments made to reduce accounts payable offset by an increase in deferred revenue. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $270 million, while bank debt was $279 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory as we ramped production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q1 cash conversion cycle was 94 days, up from 80 days, above our target range of 85 to 90 days due to higher inventories. Days of inventory was 114, representing an increase of 18 days versus the prior quarter. Days Sales Outstanding was up by 4 days to 41 days, while Days Payables Outstanding was up by 8 to 61 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.60 to $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.70 to $0.90 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending December 31, 2021. We expect gross margins to improve as we manage supply chain costs and maintain price discipline. Over the upcoming quarters, we continue to expect to achieve margins within our target model as we further scale our Taiwan operations and begin to gain traction from our new product offerings and auto configurator B2B/B2C solutions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $112 million and include $7 million in stock option compensation expenses and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of roughly $1.5 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 53.5 shares for GAAP and 55 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2022, GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We are raising our guidance for the fiscal year 2022 ending June 30, 2022, and now expect net sales in a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion versus our prior forecast of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be at least $2.77 versus our prior forecast of $2.60. And non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3.20 versus our prior forecast of $3. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 54.1 million shares for GAAP and 55.6 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million. I\u2019ll turn it back over to you now, Nicole. Nicole Noutsios : Operator, now you can open up the line for question. Operator : The floor is now open for your question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi guys. Yes, listen. Good afternoon. Congrats and thanks for taking the question. I guess, a couple for me, just to start off, could you talk about, it seems like you\u2019re highlighting both in the press release and then in your remarks new design wins and speaking of them, broadly that there across the business. Could you maybe talk to what you saw that was \u2013 those exciting for you and most incremental to the business throughout the quarter. And then I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you. A very good question. Yes, I share in last few quarters, we started engage more and more large enterprise account. And we, again, it\u2019s even more than handle for a larger account in last few quarter, including 5G/Telco, including AI machine learning and including HPC as well. So pretty much across broader range. We have a more customer and with our B2B automation, auto congregator to I just mentioned. Now we are able to have sales engineer and PA to communicate with customer much more efficiently. So now we have a more bandwidth to talk to more customer, talk more customer\u2019s application in more detail. So I do \u2013 we are contained again, customer and again design win. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s helpful context, Charles. Thanks. And how would you characterize, I guess, the \u2013 I don\u2019t even know, if I want to call it progress with the new Taiwan facility. Could you just describe for us the appropriate, like, the appropriate context of that we can understand, what the operation feels like right now both from a production perspective, but also from a revenue generating perspective as well. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. As I share with \u2013 we see in last few quarter, Asian campus production capacity is very important to our business. In USA, especially, our operation have been pretty much focused on our pay area and that\u2019s 28 years and it really cost too high. So we are very happy finally, we have a big campus in Taipei, Taiwan, and now we have big capacity ready. Indeed, we \u2013 today, we just utilize about less than 30% of our capacity. So we have cheaper capacity available in Asia now. So we are very happy and we are a start to a very aggressively engaged customer in Asia and EMEA or even leverage Taiwan, the capacity to support a customer in USA. So that\u2019s a very positive changing to us. Ananda Baruah : How long Charles, any estimate on, where you\u2019ll get kind of normalized capacity utilization in the Taiwan facility? Charles Liang : Okay, good. Because of our global shortage, otherwise our revenue must be much bigger than Taipei. We alarmed at $1.03 billion this quarter, because we\u2019re always shortage otherwise that much should be much bigger. So at this moment, our iteration rate in Taiwan is about 30% or a little bit bad. And we expect once the global shortage program to this, we will use unpaid to 80% to 100% capacity in Taiwan almost in a few quarters. So we have a very strong demand and just need a supply chain to be improved. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s really helpful, Charles. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll get back into the queue. Thanks a lot. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for thinking my question. A couple of follow-ups on \u2013 regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, can you remind me how much more alone a credit you have that you can utilize? David Weigand : So we have a $200 million line of credit with the Bank of America, and we also have over $300 million in Credit Lines in Taiwan as well. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. So after a total of $500 milllion, that\u2019s I know with this being neutralize, right? David Weigand : Yes. So we\u2019ve \u2013 as you see from our balance sheet, we\u2019re sitting at about $279 million. Mehdi Hosseini : Got you. Okay. And then regarding the growth, can you maybe, Charles or anybody else from the team help me understand? What would the key growth drivers in Asia more than double on a year-over-year basis and the U.S., which is the largest market had a double digit growth, but Asia was up double digit. What were the key drivers behind that growth? Charles Liang : Yes. Indeed, in Asia, we did not have really strong promotion before, because our capacity before it was limited in Asia. And most of the time, we had to ship the port out from USA to customer in Asia, that was our business before. Now we saw Taiwan capacity much, much bigger maybe. So we are very aggressively approaching customer in Asia and these are not just in Asia, in support European customer from Asia, also very good arrangement. And we start to focus kind of our sales force in Asia. So that\u2019s a major reason, and we will continue to invest more as sales marketing team in Asia and EMEA as well as in East Coast, indeed in USA, East Coast will be a very sweet spot for us as well. And we just have a strong team as not to focus on U.S. is cost now. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, perhaps maybe if I rephrase the question, you highlight the three buckets of revenue, organic and organic enterprise OEM and the Telco. Was there any particular end market that was particularly strong in Asia? Charles Liang : AI, for example, and Telco \u2013 5G/Telco, for example, and in either because our Asia market share was a small before, so basically we have a lot of norms to grow in Asia. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Nicole Noutsios : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Nehal Choski of Northland Capital Markets. Nehal Choski : Yes. Thank you. And fantastic results and very strong guidance, great feedback. A couple of questions for me. Charles, what\u2019s your perspective on whether the worst of global supply chain issues have passed or not. And then related to that, how long do you think it will be prudent to continue carrying more base inventory than typical? Charles Liang : Very good question and a big question. As you know, we usually keep about $900 million in mentoring and now grow to almost $1.3 billion. So the reason why we grow inventory so quickly, because we want to make sure we are doing our best to support the customers and to support our growth. So we continue to improve our relationship with out supply chain, and it\u2019s really a big shortage, especially in chips like those I/O chip, especially, a small chip like what I mentioned before. In some CPU shortage as well, CPU some slow delivery as well. So we are facing to lots of logistics delay and however because we are providing IP total solution now. So we taking care all our difficulty portion and keep complete pattern play direct solution to our customer. So most our customer now are very appreciate, direct scale total solution. And we just had to continue working with our supply chain to enable those shortage item. And how soon can we fix those problems. It\u2019s really a global problem. So people included myself, I guess maybe at least in three months to four months. And hopefully, of the day, things will be improving. Nehal Choski : Great. Thank you for that perspective. And then following on Mehdi\u2019s question regarding regional performance, helpful on what\u2019s driving Asia. David, you did say that U.S. was down 14% Q2. Is that seasonal? Or is there something more going on there? David Weigand : I think it\u2019s simply just a matter of digestion. We had some large, very large purchases, and there was some digestion of those purchases, and we expect those to return. Nehal Choski : Got it. All right. I\u2019m going to get back in the queue. You addressed some good questions as well. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and also congrats on the quarter and the guide. Just kind of dovetailing off the component question. Everybody is definitely seeing supply constraint. I guess my question on that is, can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing from a pricing perspective of some of the key components in the supply chain, be it memory or other components? And what you\u2019re doing to maybe pass-through some of that pricing? Or how effective you\u2019ve been there? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, as you may know, right, CRM price is dropping now since last month, so maybe two months ago. So CRM supply is getting a much better position than before. So other than CRM and most of the other components, still have a big shortage. And we foresee some IC price will continue going up. As you know, even TSMC November 1, some of their product line cost will increase to their customer. So overall, I feel \u2013 seen some improvement, but won\u2019t be right away. Aaron Rakers : And how are you reacting with your own pricing? Charles Liang : We basically pass-through to our customer whatever we can, and customer is getting used to this model because we just cannot afford to get so much price rise. This year, the customer pretty much understand that. Aaron Rakers : Yes. In this environment, a lot of companies have seen \u2013 are requested maybe their own customers to provide longer lead times on their own purchase commitments. Have you also asked your customers to lengthen out their lead times and, therefore, given you more visibility in the business beyond maybe just this next quarter? Charles Liang : Yes. Basically, we hope so. But the problem is we cannot deliver even our back order today. So that\u2019s why we did not push customers to predict order much earlier, but we hope they can more transparent to us about their forecast, about their IPO, yes, for sure. But again, the current back orders indeed have been a big demand, and we had to fulfill there as soon as possible. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And then the final question, just kind of strategically, I\u2019m curious about is, I think the company is fairly well-positioned given your engineering presence and breadth around the role of AI and the proliferation of AI from a compute layer perspective. Can you help us appreciate how material, AI is? I\u2019m assuming that server platforms that are incorporating a GPU predominantly, how big that business is? How fast it\u2019s growing? And any kind of thoughts at a high-level? How much that changes the weakness of the mix of your business on a AI-optimized server relative to more of a traditional server? Charles Liang : Yes. AI-optimized server for so is high-value, high performance, high-value, and we are very aggressive to continue to grow our AI machine. Indeed, our AI machine, including complete system and some payable, I believe our market share still pretty much top one or top two. I hope top one, and I believe will be continue to grow very strongly because we have been focused so much on those high-end products, including a Total Solution, right, AI Total solution. We start to ship kind of AI Cloud to some of our partner. Again, that makes our customers\u2019 job much easier. So when we ship that direct to customers, customers are able to get targeting networking cable, power cable and pretty much ready to run their applications. So with Total AI Cloud, Total AI solution, I am very optimistic that our deep learning AI machine, even including a video streaming solution will continue to grow very fast. Aaron Rakers : Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Lopez of Vertical Group. Jon Lopez : Hi. Thanks very much. Can you hear me all right? David Weigand : Yes, Jon. We can. Jon Lopez : Great. Thanks, David. So I had a couple of quick ones. I wanted to start on the inventory side as well. So I apologize for doing that, but if I remember correctly, I think your purchase commitments or inventory purchase commitments as of June, excuse me, were up $550 million, $575 million something in that ballpark and add doubled versus where they were at the end of 2020 \u2013 calendar 2020? Can you give us a feel for where that stands now as of the end of September, and just given the size of this increases does that ultimately find its way onto your balance sheet? Or are you now it\u2019s sort of a steady state level where what\u2019s going out is more being matched with what\u2019s coming in? David Weigand : Yes. So as I think the key is we\u2019re going into a seasonally strong December quarter. And so we \u2013 that combined with the fact that we\u2019ve got to make sure we get in ahead of supply chain delays as much as possible has really driven our decision to increase inventory levels up. So therefore in this \u2013 in the current market with the delays, both on the delivery side, as well as on the production side and the delays in containers making it to port, you\u2019ve got to order earlier. So therefore we have to \u2013 we have to place orders in order to keep up with our customer demand. So that\u2019s really, and that\u2019s why we increased our credit lines and use those to increase inventory. Jon Lopez : Okay. Got it. And just off the top of your head David, do you know where that number stood as of September? David Weigand : I went out \u2013 we\u2019re don\u2019t, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t release that number on the quarter. Jon Lopez : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks for that. Secondly, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead please. David Weigand : So we\u2019ll have a little more color in the 10-K. Jon Lopez : Sure. Of course. Your deferred revenue actually jumped up quite nicely. The current deferred was up like double digits, which hasn\u2019t really been the case for the last couple of quarters. Why was that? David Weigand : So two reasons. Number one, we had some customers who prepaid and number two, we had some additional services that were \u2013 an increase in services that we had to defer. Jon Lopez : Okay. That\u2019s help... Charles Liang : That expand to, I just mentioned, we start to focus on our 5S business right, the software, breaches and service and those probably have a higher profitability, but they are also generally priority four revenue. Jon Lopez : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Sorry, two other quick ones. The first one is, David, I think you made mention to gross margin. I think you said it was going to increase. I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant in the December quarter or that was just sort of an intermediate term comment. But can you remind us a) like what are the targets again; and b) just put some color around that that comment and how we should think about maybe trending and trajectory? David Weigand : Sure, absolutely. So our target model gross margin is of course 14 to 17. And we\u2019ve mentioned that again, this quarter our transportation costs or freight costs went up by $3 million or 30 basis points. And that was on top of the increase from the prior quarter. Now, I can tell you that in my discussions with our operations people, it looks like that amount is starting to level off of that the rates are leveling off. And so we are \u2013 so the guidance that we give is giving or giving is to be up both in Q2, as well as in the second half. Jon Lopez : Gotcha. Really helpful. Okay. And sort of is that leveling off a relatively recent phenomenon, or is that something maybe you observed through the course of the quarter? David Weigand : That\u2019s just, I mean, there\u2019s only been one month in this quarter, but so far they don\u2019t seem to be increasing at the same rate that they were in prior quarters. Jon Lopez : Gotcha. Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I was trying to take the prior quarter. So they kept increasing through your fiscal Q1? David Weigand : Yes. So in other words, through Q4, they continue to increase. And then in Q1, they also increased another 30 basis points. And another think about it is 30 basis points on lower evidence that the freight costs went up. So, I\u2019m saying in the current Q2, we see that leveling off. Jon Lopez : Gotcha. Really helpful. And so my very last one. Just as we think about your fiscal 2022 guidance, you mentioned that both units and prices increased in your September quarter. Excuse me, I\u2019m wondering as we think about this sort of, let\u2019s call it 20% odd growth that you\u2019re building in for your fiscal 2022. Can you give us a rough sense for how much of that is going to come from pricing versus what\u2019s going to come from units? David Weigand : I think that\u2019s too hard to judge. Yes. Jon Lopez : Okay. Okay. Would your gut be that it\u2019s going to be a combination of the two? Maybe I can leave it there. David Weigand : Absolutely. Absolutely. Jon Lopez : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Nehal Choski of Northland Capital Market. Nehal Choski : Yes. Thanks for taking my follow up questions. And great on the breakout relative to the three colors of growth that you\u2019re laid out here and I\u2019ll state really appreciate that. Do you have color on how each of these trended on a year-over-year basis relative to the overall year-over-year growth? David Weigand : Yes, so we\u2019re actually on verticals. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going back on a year-over-year basis, because we really started tracking this closely beginning with the fiscal year end. And so but as each quarter, now we\u2019ll give a little bit more insight. But I can tell you that, the one vertical that went down, which was in the 5G \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the OEM, and OEM appliance was really, as I mentioned, that was the digestion that I referred to from a couple of customers. And we see that returning that first returning in Q2. Nehal Choski : Got it. Okay, great. And then what is the risk that the strong demand that you\u2019re seeing is a result of the supply chain disruptions, and that you are having customers come through \u2013 new customers come to you in an effort to go or triple source, or of course, triple source and effectively alleviate their own supply chain issues? Charles Liang : Yes, this is a very important area, we watch very well. So most our orders are pretty evenly come from our customer base. So at this moment, I did not see in the specific this year. So pretty evenly come from many customer and from many different vertical. And by the way, our Building Block Solutions, not advantages we can simply kind of the configurator system. So even in one customer slow down, we won\u2019t have to kind of really have a hard time for over inventory. Nehal Choski : Right. I think that later part is an excellent point. So maybe frame that up of the incremental demand that you\u2019re seeing. How much of that is coming in the form of a configuration that your competitors typically would not satisfy that they\u2019re much more limited configurations that they could provide. Charles Liang : Yes. And see I\u2019m very happy to share. Most of our growth from our Building Block Solutions, after we continue to emphasize our Building Block Solutions and see the most of the customer now put it our Building Block Solutions, because it\u2019s easy to support their urgent demand and also this over inventory risk for our sale and volume sale. Nehal Choski : Okay, great. And then my final follow-up question is for Dave. SG&A, I think, was down $4 million in Q2. Is that correct? And why is that? David Weigand : So we had a little bit lower. We had \u2013 personal, it was \u2013 we had increased personnel costs. And then we did have a little bit lower bonuses this in Q2. I\u2019m sorry, in Q1, I said in Q1. Nehal Choski : Alright, got it. Thank you very much. David Weigand : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng of CJS Securities. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Great quarter and outlook. David, I was just wondering if you could clarify the sequential increase in gross margins. What\u2019s getting that \u2013 where are you finding that? Is it mostly your selling prices catching up to inflation? Are you expecting to reduce some costs or realize some other efficiencies? Or is there a mix improvement as you go forward? Just help me understand what the sequential increase coming from? David Weigand : Sure, Jon. There\u2019s a number of factors. Number one, we expect to start gaining traction from our auto-configurator, B2B, B2C solutions. We also have been exercising more price discipline. And also, we\u2019ve learned how to manage, how to better manage the passing on of freight charges and other things and our cost increases to our customers. So that, along with the \u2013 some of the margins from our new product offerings give us a good little bit better insight into margin growth. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Perfect. And I just wanted to touch on the auto-configure and B2B. You mentioned actually. What was the sales advantage there? I don\u2019t know if you can quantify it exactly, but just give us a sense of how important that is to your growth and how big you expect it to be going forward in the next couple of quarters? Charles Liang : It will be very important, especially for our long-term. Before we see many come from manpower sales, FA and PA to work with customer one-by -one. But now we see inhabiting database, not online for CT, are able to help customers figure out what\u2019s the base configuration, what\u2019s the base of the product for them and then embed it through our commence center-based service. So almost all our customer in sales who have able use that system are very happy with the service and shrink the time to communicate and make the communication much more accurate product optimization, much more cost down and data performance. So for midterm, long-term, I\u2019m very optimistic with auto-configurator command center-based B2B system. Jon Tanwanteng : Great. Maybe just the last one for me. What is the margin of sales through that channel compared to your regular sales maybe versus what it normally has been? Charles Liang : We did not share with that number yet. But basically, the profitability will be higher because B2B auto-configurator, we are able to work with many more customers and especially a lot of middle-sized enterprise customer now. But before we can take are only large-scale customer because we do not have in our man power to take care of 2 million ton. But now with automation we have, we are able to reach to many more middle-sized enterprise account. And for those accounts, as the pro-margin data. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. One moment. Charles Liang : Thank you so much to join us. And very happy to see you next quarter again. Thank you and a good day.",

Charles Liang : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1.17 billion for fiscal Q2 2022, which was 41% year-over-year growth, and our sequential growth was 14%. We have seen strong growth in all our key verticals and geographies despite challenges from global component shortage and COVID impact. More importantly, our Total IT Solutions strategy has been empowering us to continuously gain market share, all thanks to our dedicated employees, powerful server building block solutions, and finally, our fast growing software products. With the bigger TAM and potential from Total IT Solutions, I believe our growth trend will continue for many years to come and getting stronger quarter-after-quarter. Now, let\u2019s look at some key highlights from the quarter. First, again, our fiscal second quarter net revenue totaled $1.17 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 14% quarter-on-quarter, at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. It\u2019s Super Micro\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of fast revenue progression as we continue our growth trajectory at multiple times the industry\u2019s growth rate. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, compared to $0.63 in the same quarter last year, which was 40% growth and at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.90.  All our major geographies contributed significantly to our year-over-year growth, especially in the APAC region which grew 76% year-over-year. The Taiwan expansion boosts our APAC and EMEA growth momentum by providing additional capacity and lowering operational cost. We continued to expand the B2B Auto-configurator program to service significantly more customers during the quarter. Our innovative center -- command-center based on-line business system has been improving our sales, FAE, PM team\u2019s efficiency, as well as our key customer\u2019s satisfaction.  Recent market conditions have presented us with better opportunities to accelerate our business transition from a hardware company to a Total IT Solutions company. The transition has enabled Super Micro to offer customers higher value and product availability with optimal hardware, software, services, switches and more. Our results have shown that our outperform -- we outperform our previous $10 billion annual revenue target timeline we shared in the few quarter ago. More encouragingly, we are observing a diversified growth across our target verticals, which are large enterprise, AI, machine learning, Cloud, 5G/telco and IoT. Our design wins and engagements with Fortune-listed customers continue to grow quickly with our Total IT Solutions. Our push towards Total IT Solutions is benefiting Super Micro and our customers in multiple ways. Most notably, our customers will receive higher-quality, plug-and-play ready products that are fully optimized, integrated and validated in-house. This effort is also helping Super Micro and our customers mitigate the impact of the global supply chain disruptions by accurately forecasting, building inventories in scale and prioritizing with our strategic partners. As a result, our Total IT Solutions dramatically improve our customer\u2019s time-to-market and increase Super Micro\u2019s value. Our Total IT Solutions are built upon a robust knowledge of system architecture and building blocks that can be optimized for most market verticals. With the rise of Omniverse and Metaverse, we have recently introduced several new architectures to enhance our GPU product offerings. Our new Universal GPU architecture allows customers to choose the best CPUs, GPUs, switches and I/O configurations to truly optimize their applications and workloads, leveraging either Intel Xeon Scalable processors or AMD EPYC processors. The Universal GPU system enables customer to standardize configurations in their clusters for the desired workloads on a single platform. This unique versatile system supports various GPUs, including NVIDIA A100 GPUs, the newly announced AMD MI200 series accelerators, many FPGA products from different companies and others. I am glad to announce that we already have many major customers and industry leaders committing to this new platform, and the only limitation is the supply chain challenge.  Partnering closely with leading technology providers in the emerging Metaverse and Omniverse ecosystems, Super Micro has doubled our GPU product lines to support these 3D and immersive workloads. Our 2U 2-node GPU system provides an optimal mix of CPU-to-GPU ratio with resource-saving features. Our high performance and highly configurable Hyper and Hyper-E servers support multiple GPUs in a single system and are ideal for use cases such as distributed AI inferencing applications, content delivery, telco micro datacenters, 5G core and many other mission critical enterprise workloads. Along with our NVIDIA A100 Delta and Redstone platforms, Super Micro\u2019s comprehensive AI system building blocks support everything from inference at the edge to high-performance computing data center for the Metaverse or Omniverse kind of application and everything in between.  Last quarter we have redefined our growth drivers to speed up our growth strategies, which include; Subsystem and Components, Complete Systems, Total IT Solutions and 5S\u2019s. Our building blocks and complete systems business have been steadily growing over the decades with the help of our partners, and they still serve as the backbone of our revenue growth. With other large enterprise customers, top technology-leading companies and appliance partners engagements, I would like to emphasize again that Total IT Solutions business is our new major growth driver now. Going forward, our investments in software products, service and networking will be the keys to improve our margins and profitability in the coming quarters and years. In summary, Super Micro is rapidly growing and transforming into a Total IT Solutions company from a server hardware company. We are accelerating our design wins and market share gains at key large global customers including enterprise, AI, machine learning, 5G/telco and Edge and IoT. We are improving our profitability and replicating our market share success in the U.S. to APAC and EMEA with the completion of our APAC expansions and rapid production ramp in Taiwan. Our new Command Center Based Auto-configurator and B2B Automation platforms are improving our operations effectiveness and customer satisfaction while accelerating our market-share gains. In closing, our 41% year-over-year revenue growth is a solid proof that Super Micro\u2019s business is taking off quickly now. I am confident that our market presence, TAM and profitability will continue to increase strongly and we invest more -- as we invest more resources instead we are -- as a Total IT Solutions company. My team and I have been diligently executing our growth strategies and accelerating the timeline to pull in our $10 billion revenue goal. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Financial -- Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. I am pleased to report our third consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $1 billion. We are seeing continued strength across all geographies and strong demand for our products and services, resulting in fiscal second quarter revenue of $1.17 billion, a 41% year-on-year increase and up 14% quarter-on-quarter. Our Q2 revenues were at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Revenues for the trailing four quarters in Q3 of fiscal year 2021 through Q of fiscal year 2022 totaled $4.17 billion. Super Micro\u2019s Q2 FY 2022 recorded revenue growth across all three of our market verticals, achieving $756 million in the Organic Enterprise and Channel and AI/ML vertical, $274 million in OEM appliance and large data center vertical and $142 million in the 5G/telco and Edge/IoT vertical. The 5G/telco and Edge/IOT vertical more than doubled sequentially as new designs went into production. Systems comprised 84% of total revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 16% of Q2 revenues. The volume of systems and nodes shipped, as well as System node ASPs increased both year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia, including Japan, increased 76% as we saw continued growth with both new and existing and customers, Europe increased 39%, U.S. increased 38% and Rest of World decreased 32%. On a sequential basis, Asia including Japan increased 8%, U.S. sales increased 14%, Europe increased 20%, and Rest of World increased 19%. The Q2 gross margin was 14%, which was up 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q1 due to price discipline and a better product/customer mix. This increase was achieved in spite of our increased use of air freight and higher supply chain costs. On a year-over-year basis gross margins were down 240 basis points due to a discrete cost recovery event in Q2 of last year and higher freight and supply chain costs in the current year. Turning to operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year to $113 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $103 million. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP basis were driven by higher personnel costs and increased headcount; higher stock compensation expense and lower research and development NRE credits. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a non-GAAP basis were driven primarily by higher personnel costs and the increased headcount and lower research and development NRE credits. Other Income & Expense included interest -- including interest expense was a $1.8 million expense, as compared to a $0.8 million expense last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to loss from remeasurement of our Taiwan Dollar loans to a weaker U.S. Dollar, so FX. This quarter the tax provision was $7.6 million on a GAAP basis and $10.9 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter. Our tax rate for GAAP and non-GAAP purposes increased this quarter primarily due to a change in U.S. tax regulations. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.2 million this quarter, as compared to $0.4 million last quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.88, which was near the high end of the guidance range due to higher revenues and higher gross margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Cash flow used in operations was $53 million, compared to cash flow used in operations of $135 million in Q1, as we continued to build inventory to be in a position to meet the increasing levels of large orders from our customers and to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. CapEx totaled $12 million for Q2 resulting in negative free cash flow of $65 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and accounts receivable, offset by cash provided from increased accounts payable, customer prepayments and deferred revenue. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $247 million, while bank debt was $100 -- was $316 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory levels as we ramped production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 98 days, up from 94 days in Q1, which is above our target range of 85 days to 90 days due to higher inventories. Days of inventory was 118 days, representing an increase of four days versus the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding was down by four days to 37 days, while days payables outstanding was down by four days to 57 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we note that our Q3 March quarter typically has some seasonal impact from the Lunar New Year holiday and we are also carefully watching impacts to the supply chain from Covid-19 related disruptions. We expect net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.58 to $0.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.70 to $0.90 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending March 31, 2022. We expect gross margins to be up slightly from Q2 levels. Our GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $118 million and include $8.5 million in stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of roughly $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% and a fully diluted share count of 54.5 million for GAAP and 56 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8.5 million in expected stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in other expenses, net of tax effects, that are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We are maintaining our revenue guidance range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion for the fiscal year 2022 ending June 30, 2022, and our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook of at least $2.77 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3.20. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP net income assumes a tax rate of 15% and a rate of 17% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2022, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 54.1 million shares for GAAP and 55.6 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 fully diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $37 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal third quarter of \u201822 -- 2022 to be in the range of $5 million to $8 million. Nicole, I will turn it back to you. Nicole Noutsios : Operator, we can now open the line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the ongoing momentum and the nice results. Congratulations on the good execution. A couple if I could. It -- so -- how is linearity through the quarter, revenue linearity and any context around new kinds of, like, new customer, like, customer expansion, workload expansion, things of that nature, would be really helpful? And then I have a quick follow up. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah. Thank you for the question. As you know, we just migrating from a Hardware Solution company to a Total IT Solution company. So lots of customer like our complete solution for the auto-ID need. So we continue to gain some really large customer and some really technology leader. So we are very happy, very excited to service more partner in the industry. And that\u2019s really help\u2026 D And then\u2026 Charles Liang : Yeah. Go for it. David Weigand : Okay. I was just going to add that, customer wise we had really good growth in the telco and the 5G/telco vertical. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Charles Liang : Essentially, like, as opposed to like an Omniverse, and Metaverse, lots of very exciting opportunity there. Ananda Baruah : Charles, do you think it sounds like Meta, correct me if it\u2019s not an accurate interpretation. But does that to say that telco picked up incrementally in December quarter and that new energy, you think is going to continue at least kind of March quarter first half of the -- first half of the calendar year here? Charles Liang : I mean, March quarter, traditionally, is our kind of soft season, but this year is different, because we have very strong demand, especially likewise, say GPU, Metaverse, Omniverse, lots of opportunity there and we already have some large engagement just try to fulfill them. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. A quick follow up Charles. Any comments\u2026 Charles Liang : Thank you. Ananda Baruah : \u2026 on demand after the June quarter? I just asked that since we\u2019re coming up on the second half of the year, any context you can provide, second half of the calendar year on sales demand? Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah. There is woman looks pretty commendable [ph], because of our strong product and Total IT Solution, lots of customer now have a bigger back order with us. So we are increasing our back order kind of in a very commendable way. Ananda Baruah : Excellent. Okay. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to get a further understanding how you\u2019re managing the inflationary trend in component prices, your inventory has gone up for two consecutive year and by about $350 million over the past six months. But then I look at your revenue guide for March and implied guide for June taking the midpoint of the fiscal year guide, it does suggest a sequential decline. And is that because you\u2019re not able to pass on extra cost or you just been conservative, despite the fact that you have built inventory or is there something else that I\u2019m missing here? And I have a follow up. Charles Liang : Yeah. Indeed, I\u2019m very happy with a big inventory now, with global supply chain difficulty. We build the inventory based on our back order. And at this moment, indeed, our back order have been very strong. And the reason why we did not update the whole year revenue and earnings, just because there are still certain uncertainty -- there\u2019s still some uncertainty in terms of supply chain. Other than that, we feel very optimistic. Mehdi Hosseini : Just on the supply \u2026 Charles Liang : And\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Go ahead, sorry, go ahead. Charles Liang : Yeah. Our inventory indeed happened to have in a very healthy, very conservative way. David Weigand : Yeah. And Mehdi, this is David. Just to answer your question, another question that you had. Our ability to pass on costs is really reflected in our increased gross margin. So those increase component costs are being passed on. Mehdi Hosseini : Got you. Okay. And then, excuse me, if I were to go back to the three buckets that you highlighted, organic OEM and 5G/telco. Thanks for providing the dollar revenue contribution. Can you also give us sequential and year-over-year changes for each bucket? David Weigand : So, Mehdi, we didn\u2019t go back to the Q2 of last year, I don\u2019t believe, although, in our -- we have guidance in our slides that we have by quarter. Yeah, that\u2019s available on our website. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. But can you -- maybe you can provide some qualitative comments as to which bucket was the strongest? David Weigand : Absolutely. So our organic enterprise and channel and AI/ML constitutes approximately 65% of our revenues. The OEM appliance bucket comprises about 25%. And then the, look the data center, I\u2019m sorry, the 5G/telco and Edge is about 10%. And that\u2019s up from 5% in the prior quarters, the 5G/telco and Edge bucket. So that\u2019s the way -- that\u2019s kind of been the trend over the past quarters. Mehdi Hosseini : So the 5G\u2026 David Weigand : The big change though\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Oh! Go ahead. David Weigand : The big change was in 5G. Yeah, was from really some from big growth and traction with telco customers. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you. Patrick Wang : Hey, Mehdi. This is Patrick. I want to just come back to one thing that you mentioned earlier in your question, which is the implied guide for June. I wouldn\u2019t read what we\u2019ve done here as implied guidance for June. What we said was, we\u2019ve given guidance for what we expect in March, given -- just given our situation today, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re actually just maintaining that the full year guidance there. We feel very comfortable with it, of course, right? But we\u2019re not actually guiding another quarter out, which is why we just -- we kept it where it was. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. David Weigand : Yeah. And the thing\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Go ahead. David Weigand : Yeah. I am sorry. This is David. So I will add to that, that we have -- we have a range, we put out a range of 4.2 to 4.6. So we\u2019re very comfortable there, sure. Mehdi Hosseini : If I may just quickly, there\u2019s also continued mismatch for components with supply and demand. There\u2019s still some mismatches. So would it be fair to say that you\u2019re also conservative, given the mismatches of availability of components? Charles Liang : You can say that\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Charles Liang : \u2026 kind of, the back order is stronger by now. We tried to be fully conservative, in case\u2026 Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. I was on mute here. Congrats on the solid results and well above difference March Q guidance. This question has already been partially answered by Patrick. But let me put a little bit finer point on this here. Why not at least narrow to fiscal year 2022 revenue guidance range given that the unchanged midpoint guidance does apply effectively about flat year-over-year for the June quarter? Charles Liang : So, our -- Nehal, our demand has never been stronger. And so we have obtained some new logos, new customers, which have designed in our products and so we feel very strong about our back order and our demand, but this is a market where supply also dictates your forecasts. And so we have to be careful about forecasting two quarters out on supply. So that\u2019s really the reason for our range. Nehal Choski : Understood. Okay. And then, yeah, slide nine is great. I love the fact that we\u2019re getting five quarter back visibility into these three vertical markets and it certainly does imply that 5G/telco and Edge has very significant year-over-year growth. And Charles, you\u2019ve mentioned that, part of this demand is Metaverse/Omniverse, not sure what Omniverse means, but I do know what Metaverse means. And I guess\u2026 Charles Liang : Yeah. Nehal Choski : \u2026I was in impression that Metaverse at least would go under the rep category, i.e., large data center, not 5G/telco. Can you just give me a little bit more understanding as to why Metaverse potentially falling into the telecom here? Charles Liang : Today there are some really four class company, big company coming to Omniverse or Metaverse, right? So we have a very strong engagement with some of them. So in terms of AI, GPU, Metaverse, we have a very strong back order now indeed and just try to work out components to fulfill over the demand. As to 5G/telco, it\u2019s relatively new territory for us. We start 5G/telco about three years ago and now we have many bigger engagement. So we are very excited for 5G/telco growth as well. Nehal Choski : Okay. So to be clear then the commentary about the strong demand for Metaverse is not related to 5G/telco, correct? Charles Liang : Not necessary. It\u2019s kind of not much related. Nehal Choski : Okay. Got it. Then, so at the Investor Day, about a year ago, you talked about the 5G/telco opportunity. There\u2019s long design cycles, long qualification cycles. And it does look like this quarter the dam broke basically. What percentage of your telecom customers you\u2019re engaged with went from qualifying to production ship? Charles Liang : A big portion. Indeed, as I just mentioned, we start 5G/telco about three years ago and then we have a very strong engagement so far and some of them start to move certain volume, some modem will move good volume later. So it\u2019s a new territory, but we overall very satisfied with a big engagement from those partner. Nehal Choski : Okay. Great. And then my last question is that, also on these vertical markets, it does imply that the OEM appliance on large data center was up only 10% year-over-year, why is that? Charles Liang : Indeed, we have some large engagement and they are kind of high value product now. As we mentioned, for really kind of meta-scale data center we are selective, but when those demand high end, kind of high value products. So we are indeed very excited. We start to gain some of those opportunities. Nehal Choski : Okay. Thank you. David Weigand : Also\u2026 Nehal Choski : Yeah. David Weigand : This is -- yeah. I\u2019ll add that, that -- the large data center vertical, I think, is going to there -- is going to vary a little bit by digestion, too, because we have some regular customers that are purchasing -- they\u2019ll purchase for two quarters or three quarters, and then they\u2019ll take up -- and they\u2019ll take a pause. But the good thing about our business is that, it\u2019s grown to the point where we have enough momentum in all areas that, that one vertical can offset the other. Nehal Choski : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Thank you. Good quarter guys and on the outlook, too, very fast. My question is, are inflation and supply chain headwind still accelerating in Q3 for you and that\u2019s maybe matched by your pricing or was it roughly the same as Q2 and maybe as a subset to that could you tell us what were the friction in this quarter, if it\u2019s any different and if you see any easing or things getting tougher? Charles Liang : Now question is that, most of our customer already get used to kind of take the responsibility for the extra cost. So that\u2019s why our gross margin or net margin will basically get in a stable right, including a higher transportation charge, basically customer already accepted it. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Great. Any commentary on where the friction is in components and shipping? Charles Liang : Overall supply chain situation have been, I would have to say, gradually improving, not much improving, but gradually improving. So we get in feel more comfortable then last quarter or before? Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Charles Liang : It was still a big concern, yeah. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. Charles, you spent a little time earlier in the call talking about the Total IT Solutions transition, could you just tell us what the margin is like in a typical Total IT Solution sale versus a historically pure hardware sale? Charles Liang : Okay. I mean, our total hardware, that\u2019s the model we have as -- we had to compete with lots of competition, right, lots of competitor. But Total IT Solution, customer need lots of software, lots of security feature and kind of like a cloud plug and play, cloud composite waiver software and utility there [ph]. So we invest a lot in this territory in last three years and now we start to harvest the results and we continue -- we will continue to invest more in software. So our kind of software value, Total IT Solution value will continue to grow. I would like to say, gradually, we may be able to add 1%, 2% or even 3% actual profit -- net profit to our revenue in next few quarter or few years. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Great. And that\u2019s -- that was part of your Investor Day target within the target model, correct? Charles Liang : Yes. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for the follow up. I have a couple if I could. Charles just going back to your comments just moment ago about imposing constraints that you actually, as you said, they are actually becoming less constrained right now. So just a clarification? Charles Liang : Data feed -- data under control, but still some concern, especially\u2026 Ananda Baruah : Okay. Got it. Charles Liang : \u2026 for a complete IT solution, right, even sometime, you just have one component in shortage and you cannot ship the whole product line, whole solution. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s improving but still lots of concern. Ananda Baruah : Understood. Understood. Helpful. And then on the gross margin, you guys talked about reaching 14% in June. So it sounds like you\u2019re tracking ahead of that and then you guided sort of up sequentially, how like -- how should we think about gross margin kind of going forward post the March quarter, I guess, trajectory wise and what are the put and takes. Just -- I think you guys have talked about sequential up December, sequential up March and sequential up June to get to 14%. And so now that you\u2019re already there, can you give us some sense of what the personality of gross margin should look like in the coming quarters, appreciate it? Charles Liang : Yeah. Basically, when our Total IT Solution become more mature, gross margin and net margin will consistently growing, that\u2019s benefited very slowly the direction. But in some time -- and I hope it happens, sometime when we engage with large scale ASP or OEM in really high revenue deal that may impact our gross margin and net margin. Although, it\u2019s though our overall margin, but when it\u2019s positive to company, overall future, we will still selectively take some deal there. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for the follow up. Just a modeling follow up. If I take $3.20, minimum of $3.20 EPS guides for FY 2022 and assume $0.80 for March then my June EPS would be up over $0.90. So you are expecting margin expansion from June -- from March to June, is that the right way of thinking about to get to the $3.20 minimum EPS for FY 2022. David Weigand : So -- go ahead, Charles. Go ahead. Charles Liang : Yeah. Basically, June, always our kind of harvest season, right. So this year, I believe, same opportunity. June will be very strong quarter I believe. And so as to gross margin maybe a little bit lower. But if that happen, the net profit should be more than $0.90, maybe more than $1. Maybe you have some come in there. David Weigand : Yeah. Mehdi, so we -- we\u2019re very comfortable being inside 14% to 17%. That\u2019s our target. We\u2019ve guided up for Q3 at higher margin. We said we should be up slightly in Q3 and for Q4 we -- we\u2019re not giving updates on Q4. But for the full year, as we said before, very comfortable with the guidance that\u2019s out there, because it\u2019s got a -- it has a low range and high range. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Charles Liang : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1 billion \u2013 $1.36 billion for fiscal year Q3 2022, which was 51% year-over-year growth and 16% quarter-on-quarter growth sequentially. These results are well above our guidance given three months ago and above our recently updated range given two weeks ago. The continued five quarters of strong earnings indicate our total IT solution growth strategy is working well, and we are only at the very beginning of the breakout. Now let's look at some of the key highlights from the quarter. First, again, our fiscal third quarter net revenue totaled $1.36 billion, up 51% year-on-year and up 16% quarter-on-quarter. We are above our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. It's Super Micro\u2019s fifth and 60th quarter of faster revenue progression, and we continue to execute our strong growth trajectory at three times to four times higher than the overall industry's growth rate. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was more than tripled year-over-year and was $1.55 compared to $0.50 years ago. This 210% growth was well above with the higher end of our guidance range of $0.17 to $0.19, demonstrating strong operating leverages and the customers accepting the value of our total IT solutions. Growth in our major geographies was well balanced, and our recent the Taiwan expansion has contributed to our better operation margin and meeting our growth customer demand. Our results in the past five quarters are showing that we are ahead of our $10 billion annual revenue target that was shared last year March. And our profitability has been improving greatly as well since then. Based on our current demand and capacity, we are forecasting at least $1.45 billion revenue for the coming June quarter to end the fiscal 2022 on a strong note at above $5 billion yearly revenue. Looking further ahead, I believe we will continue to have a strong fiscal year 2023 in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion annually and expect to reach our $10 billion yearly revenue at least one year than the original plan we shared back in 2021 March. The fuel that accelerates our revenue came from our success with our total IT solution in AI, enterprise, Cloud, Edge telco and customers from many other verticals. Riding on the strength and the foundation of Super Micro\u2019s optimal building broad architecture, our total IT solutions allow customers to quickly deploy without going through the complications of design, meditation, solution and integration. This strategy also positions Super Micro very profitably changed the ongoing supply chain challenge compared to our competition. With our building growth and faster growing economy of scale, we can create and deliver workload optimized solutions to customers with time-to-market advantage, quality, performance, cost and TCO advantages. To grow our solutions and customer base faster and more efficiently, we are on track with our command-center based Auto-configurator and B2B, B2C automation platforms. Many customers have tried and like this intelligent database and wafer-based service for many quarters. This represents our next opportunity to scale up and scale out our application optimal solution to many more customers, 24/7 with no downtime and no manpower bandwidth limitation. The B2B and B2C automation program will be greatly launched nationwide in this month, indeed next week, I believe. It will dramatically improve our engineering, operations, sales and service effectiveness and customer satisfaction while accelerating our market share gains to enrich our total IT solution product portfolio, we have doubled our software engineering resource in the past few years to build new features to power our enterprise datacenter and OEM customers. Our Super cloud composer and other software products manage GPU, compute, storage and networking building broker at cloud scale, including rich analytics. So data center operators can make clinical data-driven decisions to improve workflow efficiently. In middle and long term, we see our investment in throughout datacenter management software stack will enable future infrastructure as a service and monitor as a service functionality and that will further enhance our total IT solution capability and value.  Our recent Taiwan and US expansion are focusing on delivering [indiscernible] [9.53] total IT solutions in volume, capable of shipping thousands of racks per month directly from SuperMicro campuses, designed with green computing in mind. This energy saving rack-scale solutions, leveraging our latest real air cooling and liquid technologies.  More and more of our customers are able to run their datacenter with PoE close to 1.06 or even better. Customers can expect lower TCO by saving energy costs, while increased performance per megawatt in their facility substantially. In some other cases, our customer increased computing capacity up to 15% with the same energy budget. Manufacturing these customers are quite happy to receive higher-quality, higher credit rating products. They are fully optimized, integrate and validate by SuperMicro. Our R&D organizations are happy and hard at work to expand our new technology product lines with the upcoming new Intel, better graphics and AMD in all our processes. We again are ready to bring time-to-market advantages to our customers. We are pleased to see a strong trend in terms of customer seeding and early deployment requests.  We are especially partnered closely with NVIDIA and other leading technologies partners in the emerging Metaverse and Omniverse ecosystems and double our GPU product line to support this opportunity and immersive workloads. With all of the new technologies, including PCI-E Gen 5, CXL, CDR5 [ph], the new 350 watt CPU and 700 watt GPU, our portfolio of new platform for rack-scale total IT solution will continue to develop and become a key growth driver for our coming quarters and years. In closing, our 51% year-over-year revenue growth and $1.55 quarterly EPS proved that our total IT solution strategy has been gaining customers' preference and trust in this growing pen. We will continue to enhance our total IT solutions capability and value while continue to lower our operation costs by leveraging our Taiwan production capacity. With our strong technical foundation, dedicated employees, server building bill solutions and application optimized green computing products, we are quickly and consistently winning new customers and their satisfaction now. More importantly, we invest in command center-based B2B and B2C platforms will help us to much efficiently increase our customer base and market share. I and my team will continue to execute our growth strategies and accelerating the time line to reach $10 billion revenue target in short term and start to plan and execute our new $20 billion midterm goal as well. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our CFO, to provide additional detail on the quarter. David? David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report solid fiscal third quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, 51% year-on-year increase and 16% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our revenue exceeded our initial guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and our recently updated range of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $1 billion. Year-to-date revenue through our fiscal third quarter, increased 43% year-over-year. Our growth initiatives with the total IT solutions targeting fast-growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU and AI workloads, software-defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud and edge IoT platforms are gaining momentum. These new growth drivers complement our traditional strength with enterprise, channel and OEM customers, leading to accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins and operating leverage. Revenues for the trailing four quarters of Q4 '21 through Q3 of fiscal year '22, totaled $4.63 billion. In the third fiscal -- Super Micro recorded balanced revenues across all three of our market verticals, demonstrating the resilient nature of our diversified end markets. We achieved $846 million in organic enterprise channel and AI and revenues, representing 62% of Q3 revenues versus 64% last quarter. It was up 44% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter, with growth driven both by our growing list of large enterprise customers and new product offerings. Our OEM clients and large data center segment achieved $423 million in revenues, representing 31% of Q3 revenues, versus 23% last quarter, which was up 54% year-over-year and up 54% quarter-over-quarter, with strong growth driven by our large, new and existing data center customers and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G/telco, Edge and IoT segment achieved $86 million in revenues, representing 7% of Q3 revenues versus 12% last quarter. This was up 159% year-over-year and down 39% quarter-over-quarter. This emerging segment represents a vast long-term opportunity for us and our design win momentum and backlog continues to grow, but short-term quarter-to-quarter result can fluctuate, depending on the timing of new customer adoption and qualification cycles. Systems comprised 85% of total revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 15% of Q3 revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASPs increase. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped and system node ASPs increased, while nodes shipped were lower due to product mix. We had a balanced distribution of revenues across geographies, with the US representing 56% of revenue; Asia, including Japan, 23% and Europe 15%, while rest of the world was 6%. On a year-on-year basis, US revenues increased 53%; Asia, including Japan increased 50%, Europe increased 27%, and the rest of the world increased 184%. On a sequential basis, gross revenues increased 19%. Asia, including Japan, increased 9%. Europe increased 5% and the rest of the world increased 124%. The Q3 gross margin was 15.6%, which was up 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q2 and up 180 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, leverage from higher factory utilization and operating efficiencies, and a continually improving product/customer mix. The quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year increase in gross margins was achieved despite continued elevated freight and supply chain costs. Turning to operating expenses. Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year to $121 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 6% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $110 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 7.5% for the quarter versus 5.2% last quarter and 3.2% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margins and operating leverage. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were driven by higher headcount and personnel costs and lower research and development NRE credits. Other income and expense was $3.1 million, in income, consisting of $4.6 million in foreign exchange gains, offset by interest expense of $1.5 million, as compared to a $1.8 million expense last quarter. This quarter, the tax provision was $16.2 million on a GAAP basis and $19.6 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter. Our tax rate for GAAP and non-GAAP purposes increased again this quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in pre-tax income in fiscal 2022. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.39 million this quarter as compared to $0.29 million last quarter. The Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $1.55, which exceeded the high-end of the original guidance range of $0.70 to $0.90, our recently updated Q3 range of $1.40 to $1.50. The increases to EPS were due to a combination of higher revenues, manufacturing efficiency, price discipline, product and customer mix and operating leverage. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $228 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $53 in Q2, as accounts receivable and inventories grew due to increasing demand from our customers and to mitigate the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, including CapEx of $11 million, Q3 negative free cash flow totaled $239 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and accounts receivable and/or reductions in customer prepayments. This was offset by cash provided from increased accounts payable and short-term debt. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $247 million, while bank debt was $547 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory levels as we ramp production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was unchanged at 98 days relative to Q2 and above our target range of 85 to 90 days due to higher inventory. Days of inventory was $117, representing a slight decrease of one day versus the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding was up by two days quarter-on-quarter compared to 9 days, while days payable outstanding was up by 1 day to 58 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We note that our Q4 June quarter is typically seasonally strong, and we are enthusiastic about several new customers and innovative new leading-edge total IT solutions ramping in multiple end markets. We are carefully watching the global macro and economic situation and impacts to the supply chain from continuing COVID-19-related disruptions. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, ending June 30, 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.45 to $1.64 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.51 to $1.69. We expect gross margins to be similar or slightly up from Q3 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $121 million and include $8 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecast to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 17.4%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%, and a fully diluted share count of $54.3 million for GAAP and 55.79% shares for non-GAAP. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we are raising our revenue guidance range from $4.2 billion, $4.6 billion to a new range of $4.96 billion to $5.04 billion and raising our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook from at least $2.77 to a range of $4.16 to $4.35, and our non-GAAP diluted net income per share from lease 320 to a range of $4.53 to $4.71. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income assumes a tax rate of 16.5% and a rate of 18.7% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2022, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 53.6 million shares for GAAP and 55.1 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 fully-diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $39 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses. Net of tax effects, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. Finally, we expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Nicole, we\u2019re ready for Q&A. Nicole Noutsios : Operator, we can now open the line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah wit Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah, congrats on the great execution first half of this calendar year, it sounds like it's a good following through here. Two, if I could, Charles and David, what would you guys \u2013 first time we've got the chance to talk to you guys since you pre-announced. What would you guys say, you would consider to have been incremental versus 90 days ago that's leading to such strong revenue execution for both the March quarter and now the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks a lot. Charles Liang : Yeah. That's been utilize because of the supply chain, because there are always some invisible factor. And that's why I mean earlier I mean in March quarter, we try to be conservative. But it's turn out, we have many customers really like our IP total solution, and we ship a lot of completed rig. Indeed, our direct scale PnP, plug and play rack solution, grew a lot year-over-year. Roughly, this year compared with last year, our rack product grew about 5 to 6 \u2013 5 times to 6 times growth. And this momentum, I believe, will continue to be very strong in the next 12 months. So we expect another 3x to 5x direct scale PnP product line growth. So that's why, I mean, the growth has been a little bit surprised us. Ananda Baruah : That's great context, Charles. And then, Charles, I'm just going to ask you sort of what is the next probably more natural follow-ups since you just remarked that you expect another 3x to 5x. Is the 17% to 23% long-term growth rate? Is that still the appropriate growth rate -- or should it really be something stronger than that as you look out the next couple of years? Thanks. Charles Liang : Next couple of years can be very strong. But again, it depends on our global supply chain situation. As David has mentioned, COV19 still challenging us and also macroeconomic condition. So if in is not much worse, I believe our growth rate year-over-year virtually will continue to grow. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Charles Liang : Thank you. Patrick Wang : Hey, Ananda, this is Patrick. I'm just going to jump in here. You also note that Charles also talked about is expectations on fiscal 2023 and the implied growth rate there. So that's another data point. Charles Liang : Yes. Next year, I mean, fiscal 2023 at this moment, I believe $6 billion to $7 billion will be relatively a very conservative estimation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. And thanks for taking my question and actually, I have a couple of follow-ups. Charles, as you look into next fiscal year, how do you see seasonal trend impacting your September quarter? And I asked that because you're doing really well, especially with diversification of revenue. And I think it would really help us how we should think about seasonal factor and how you would set up the company for $6 billion to $7 billion of revenue run rate in the fiscal year 2023? And I have a follow-up. Charles Liang : Thank you. Very good question. Indeed, traditionally, September will be our slow season. But this time can be quite different, because we have a very strong back order now. And again, lots of customer, high-profile customers really like our rack-scale plug and play solution. So we are preparing the big growth in that segment. So I believe this year, September, we will have a great quarter. It can be even more than June quarter. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then a question for David. You've had three consecutive quarter of cash burn. And given the strength and your backlog, should assume that you're going to burn cash again in the June quarter? David Weigand : Yes, Mehdi, I think that as our expand increases, as we have to add accounts receivable and inventory, we will continue to use cash. But we're using it for customers and for inventory. So we would consider that to be really strong uses. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open, Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you and congrats on the awesome results and amazing guidance. Would you say that the component availability situation has improved at all quarter-to-date or during the March quarter relative to the December quarter? Charles Liang : A few months ago, we suppose that situation will gradually improve and unfortunately, there are some parts -- I believe it continues to be very tight. That's why we still suffering supply chain ability program. Some components, yes, have been dramatically improved, but there are some other components still in a serious shortage. So, we try to improve that situation for sure. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And so clearly, guidance is indicating that there was no pull-in of demand, especially in the context of how Intel guide. And thus the share gains that you guys are putting up appear to be very sustainable. Still I'd like to hear your pushback that Super Micro's lower lead-time and better management of these constrained components are not leading to these massive share gains that you're seeing at this point in time? Charles Liang : Indeed, because right scale, I mean, present solution, we plan in advance both with customer understand their future demand and we plan in advance flowing all the different components in the events. And then we are able to ship the complete drag to customer kind of relatively efficient, more timing efficient than others. So, at least, I believe, is one of the reasons why we are able to grow. And we will continue to extend the customer base to offer them reg scale solution. Indeed, we have prepared to double our reg scale capacity in the coming quarter -- indeed in June quarter. So, we feel pretty strong that we will be able to continue to help customers to have their supply chain challenge. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. And then cash consumption was actually in line with what I had expected. And I presume that was also in line with what you guys had expected given the revenue outperformance, given the cash conversion cycle was flattish Q-to-Q. A, is that correct? Was it in line with what you had expected given the revenue outperformance? David Weigand : No, it was, Nehal and also, we also have to look out to Q4 and beyond in planning our inventory levels. So, it is going in line. I mean the fact that we have the high growth rate, 51% year-over-year is definitely going to continue to challenge working capital. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, yes. And as such, there's been no share buybacks, right, because all the cash is needed to finance the growth at this point in time, the massive growth that you're seeing? David Weigand : Yes, exactly right. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And given that the cash consumption is tracking what you would expect given the revenue growth that you're putting up, does this give you incremental confidence to utilize debt to make capitalist turn track your non-GAAP earnings as opposed to waiting for a slowdown in the business before you can really start a share repurchase program in earnest? David Weigand : Well, we also have to watch the overall environment. And so we're trying to strike the balance. Charles Liang : Yes, we are talking about a possibility. But given the macroeconomic still have lots of unknown factors. That's why we try to be very careful. Nehal Chokshi : All right, fair guys. Congratulations. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on -- again, on a really great quarter and the outlook. First question is, well, it's great to hear your component supply is getting better. I was wondering how much of a corresponding drop you're seeing in component price? Is it that's the case? And should we think of improvement in the gross margins going forward as well, maybe towards the high end of the charge range? Charles Liang : Indeed, it's hard to say because of the core situation in Asia, as basically Taiwan and Mainland China is kind of very serious. So, I believe it's hard to say. So, although we are doing our bit and believe situation will be getting improved, but exactly how fast at this moment, not much idea. David Weigand? David Weigand : Yeah. So the second part of your question, Jon, we did experience some gross margin expansion from higher efficiency, which means that we actually -- we had higher throughput our factories at a lower per unit cost. And so, we do expect that to continue, especially as we ramp up production in Taiwan. And so, we do look forward to further margin expansion. Charles Liang : Indeed, the one factor we did not share before, but I'd like to take a little chance to share with everyone. With our continuing growing in rec scale, product play rec scale product. Indeed, with our current facility in USA campus and Taiwan campus. When business continued to grow mostly the current capacity, we can support our revenue up to $12 billion. So our capacity is pretty up. So looking forward in the next many quarters, when our volume continues to grow, our gross margin and net profit will continue to gain advantage from the economical side, economical scale, I mean. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. That's great color. Thank you. And it's really great to see that capacity. My second question is regarding cash flow and some people have touched on this a little bit. Is it in your interest to raise permanent financing to support the growth? Or you just continue to use the revolver? How should we think about your ability to just fund the growth that you've seen? Charles Liang : We are starting the possibility, kind of, depends on the macroeconomic conditions. If macroeconomic conditions continue to be healthy, then we may try to be more aggressively leveraging the money from the bank. Otherwise, we may continue to be conservative. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, understood. Congrats again. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, thanks guys for taking the follow-up. I guess, sort of, piggybacking Charles off of one of the last questions. I guess, how much of the revenue upside for the March and June quarter is from new demand that you may have been conservative about relative to how much do you think was demand that you have been getting indications about, but that supply chain became available for. And really, I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much how much of this is supply chain related? And is the follow-through dependent to an extent on new supply chain continuing to get released? I appreciate that both. Charles Liang : Yeah, very good question. Indeed, our demand continue growing, have become stronger and stronger. So the really big limitation now indeed is supply chain to us. So that's why everyday, we are spending time to figure out how to improve the supply chain. So that's the situation. The demand is strong and keeping growing, because of our better technology, total solution and getting very strong support, I suppose. Ananda Baruah : That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up there. I've been jumping between calls a little bit to see, so I apologize if it has already been answered or spoken to. But you -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the total IT solutions being a catalyst for demand in general. And I think actually, you completed racks, maybe even specifically in the prepared remarks. And so any context you can give us about what you're seeing, I guess, like engagement context. I suppose, with your customers that having the sort of IT Solutions can be a real catalyst to revenue right now? Okay, it looks like it may be -- and I guess is the implication if it's showing up in an increasingly bigger way, first half of this calendar year. Thanks a lot. Charles Liang : Yeah. Indeed, in our supply chain. David, do you want to add something or Patrick. The supply chain has been puzzling us for many, many quarters, as you know, right? So at this moment, our current customers, existing customers and some new customers indeed all have a strong demand. And with that had to work out, David, maybe you can add something to or Patrick. David Weigand : Yeah. So we're seeing Ananda, we're seeing really a lot of high demand in the AI and ML area. And so those -- the workloads that are being addressed there and the solutions that we're providing are being well received by our customers. And so the engagements that we're in, that's the driver that we're seeing that AI has led our growth over the last three to four quarters. Patrick Wang : Yeah. This is Patrick I'll talk to that. I'll jump in here. So the supply chain topic, we've talked about quite a bit. It's not unique to us. But I think we do have to be able to kudos and sets the operations team here at Super Micro. Because without their hard work, we're not able to get the supplies we need. But on the other side, the customers just really like our product. We've got trade products. And we talked about a strong backlog, talked about targeting of top customers. And we're seeing all that stuff play out. And so the good news is that, we've got great solutions, the customers really enjoy the benefits of our product on workloads. And it just turned out to be a very good result. So we're all pretty happy here. Charles Liang : So I agree supply chain and cash flow. In other areas, we will continue to bigot to start how can we that space utilize or how can we further grow the supply chain and more efficiently utilize our cash flow. Ananda Baruah : Excellent. Thanks so much for the context, you guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call.

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to announce record year ended out with annual revenue surpassing milestone of 5.2 billion growing 46% year-over-year. We ended the year with another great quarter with fiscal Q4 2022 revenues of 1.64 billion growing 53% year-over-year, and 21% quarter-on-quarter, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates. Our quarterly and year end results are above our guidance given three months ago and exceed our recently obtained range given several weeks ago. Our strong growth is fueled by recent run in design wins based on our rack scale total IT solutions, especially on GPU solutions and AI platforms. And I believe our solutions will continue to drive plenty of new design wins and accelerate our strong growth in the coming quarters and years. More customers are also recognizing and adopting the value of our green computing solutions, due to the rising environmental challenge and energy cost. The total solution strategy and green computing solution has resulted in our four consecutive quarters of growth at a minimum three times faster than competitors' growth story. Now, let's look at some of the key highlights from the year and quarter. First, our quarter 2022, revenue totaled 5.2 billion up 46% year-on-year above our guidance range of prior year. Our fiscal year non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.65 grew 128% year-over-year compared $2.48 a year ago which exceeded the higher end of our guidance range of $4.53 to $4.71. Our fiscal fourth quarter net revenue totaled $1.6 4 billion up 53% year-on-year and up 21% quarter-on-quarter above our guidance range of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share tripled year-over-year and was $2.62 compared to $0.81 a year ago and was way above the high-end of our guidance range of $1.51 to $1.59 and pretty much now strong operating leverage and has more preference to our rack scale total IT solutions. With our total IT solutions experienced robust growth in USA this year. We will continue to gain even greater domestic attraction going forward. We will also expand our total IT solution to both Europe and Asia markets in the coming quarters and years. We are excited as of this generation opportunity to become a global leader of rack scale plug and play IT solutions. Our robust fiscal year results reinforced our competence in achieving the $10 billion in annual revenue target much sooner than we guide last year. And we are now preparing for our $20 billion mid-term mission that we discussed last quarter. Based on our current supply and capacity, at least at a midpoint of our guidance range. We are forecasting 1.57 billion in revenue for the upcoming September quarter. I'm also confident that our full fiscal 2023 revenue will be above the prior guidance range of 6 billion to 7 billion. We now expect revenue to be in the range of 6.2 billion to 7 billion with EPS at least at $7.50, following the macroeconomic conditions uncertainty, we are optimistic that some order supply chain and logistics issue will begin to subside. From a market perspective, we continue to see increasing demand for accelerating compute and AI platforms. We are meeting this demand at a both system and rack-scale level with our total IT solutions which are supported by our over 20 years of seasonal billing growth development. This billing growth products allow us to create highly optimized rack-scale plug and play direct single solutions for our customers with lower infrastructure cost and increase in significant TCO savings. Our total IT solution approach streamline design, dedication, solution and integration, resulting in a much shorter lead times for our customers which optimized quality and performance. Moreover, our total IT solution simplified integrated [indiscernible] control. In addition, our super cloud composer, orchestrator, security and other products can help only manage compute, acceleration, storage and network building products at cloud-enabled including rich analytics. Data center operator can easily leverage these information to [indiscernible] grow workload efficiency. So, we are expanding our investment in our data center management software stack that will enable to draw infrastructure as a service and secure monitoring as a service functionality for enhancing our total IT solution capability and value. This one stop shop approach we are aligned with emerging growth market across AI, machine learning, software defined storage, networking, public and hybrid cloud, and 5G, IoT and telco. We previously shared that we were certain that people in our community interface intelligent business automation, with new B2B B2C automation platform is being used and validated by more and more of our customer as we speak. These intelligent auto configurator will leverage our system building product methodology to carry out application optimized solutions to a much broader customer base. We expect that this tool will help tremendously grew our go-to-market initiatives, product design, operations, and service effectively. Most importantly, the automation process will considerably grow our customer base and improve customer satisfaction starting from pretty much this fiscal year. Our current manufacturing scale and capacity is a build to support between 10 billion to 12 billion in annual revenue as we continue to ramp up our next scale capabilities in our global facilities. During the June quarter, we shipped over 1000 plug and play rack, today -- in the September quarter, we have double our rack-scale capacity with enhanced features at our new building [indiscernible]. Our rack-scale capacity can be up to 6000 direct for quarter now. Our total development activities continue to grow strongly with close partnership with NVIDIA extending our GPU system product line including H100 very strong mix and very top product lines. Our early deployment programs with our upcoming Intel and AMD product lines are mostly ready just waiting for the new Intel and AMD processor to be available. Switching gear, we stay committed to lead the market in green computing solutions with our resource saving designs both to reduce environmental impact and of course our customers' operation. As we apply our green computing solutions at a rack-scale level, we can put in even better quality and time to market value to our customers. Higher energy costs and limitation on electricity usage will continue to strain many companies in the near future. We saw this dynamic and challenge since a decade ago, and we have been at the forefront with technology and solution that help customers go for higher temperature operation terra center, fully air cooling or liquid cooling. DNA of our customers achieved to getting TCO employee reduction in their data centers turn to 1.05 from the achieved evidence of 1.57 or even higher. By our calculations [indiscernible] adoption of our green computing solutions or other suppliers\u2019 solution with similar energy visions will potentially save the IT industry more than $10 billion in electricity costs here or eliminating equivalent of more than 30 fossil fuel power plants equal to saving 8 billion trees of our planet. Personally, I\u2019m very glad to see increased demand for energy efficient solutions for cost savings but more importantly, we must do this for our Mother Earth. Encouraging, we are focused on building and delivering much more greener rack-scale total IT solutions. From an industry perspective this is that greatest opportunity Super Micro has ever seen since our founding 29 years ago. Our year-over-year top and bottom-line performance is evidence that our total IT solution strategy is accelerating. I see our room to grow is at least another 4x in the coming years why we believe that our time will continue to expand with continued applications. We will continue to address these technology intersection by enhancing our total IT solutions, capability and capacity with the most software and we will continue to gain market share and extend it to new verticals, which increase our business scale and operating [Technical Difficulty]. My team and I will continue to escalate our growth strategies and accelerating the timeline to our 10 billion revenue target is short-term and $20 billion revenue in the future. I will now pass the call to Dave Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer to provide additional details of the quarter. Thanks. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report fiscal fourth quarter revenues of 1.64 billion or 53% year-on-year and 21% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our revenues exceeded our initial guidance range of 1.4 billion to 1.48 billion and our recently updated range of 1.58 billion to 1.63 billion. For fiscal year 22, we reported revenues of 5.2 billion representing 46% growth over fiscal year 21 revenues of 3.56 billion. Our growth initiatives are gaining momentum with our total IT solutions targeting fast growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU and AI workloads, software defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud and 5G Edge IoT platform. These new growth drivers complement our traditional strength, with enterprise channel and OEM customers, leading to accelerated revenue growth, expanding margins and operating leverage. In the fourth fiscal quarter Super Micro recorded balanced revenues across all three of our market verticals, demonstrating the resilient nature of our diversified end markets. We achieved 835 million in organic enterprise and channel and AI and revenues representing 51% of Q4 revenues versus 62% last quarter, up 24% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth in this segment was driven by our growing list of large enterprise customers and new product offerings. Our OEM appliance and large data center segments achieved 717 million in revenues representing 44% of Q4 revenues versus 32% last year, up 95% year-over-year and up 67% quarter-over-quarter with strong growth driven by large new and existing data center customers and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G telco edge IoT segment achieved 83 million in revenues representing 5% of Q4 revenue versus 6% last quarter and was up 172% year-over-year and down slightly by 4% quarter-over-quarter. For the full fiscal year 2022, our organic enterprising channel and AI and our revenues grew 40% to represent 61% of fiscal year 22 revenues. Our OEM appliance and large data center segment grew 44% and represent 32% of revenues. Our emerging 5G, telco edge and IoT segment grew 163% and represented 7% of total revenues. Our mix of complete systems and rack-scale total IT Solutions has been increasing steadily. Systems comprise 91% of total revenue and subsystem accessories represented 9% Q4 revenue. On a year-over-year basis and also on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASP increased due to product and customer mix. We had a balanced distribution of Q4 revenues across geographies, with U.S. representing 66% of revenues, Asia 17%, Europe 14% and rest of the world 20%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 65% as the gained market share with our advanced Rack-scale total IT solutions for emerging high growth server workloads. Asia increased 38%, Europe increased 21% and the rest of the world increased 8%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. in revenues increased 41%, Asia decreased 9%, Europe increased 9% and the rest of the world 30%. In Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.6% up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q3 and up 390 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs, leverage from higher factor utilization, operating efficiencies and our continually improving product customer mix. While the supply chain disruptions achieved some success in controlling freight and other logistics costs through disciplined execution. Our Q4 gross margin was above the high-end of our long-term target model range of 14% to 17% and demonstrates the success of our new high value total IT solutions. Turning to operating expenses. Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased slightly by 1% quarter-on-quarter and 15% year-on-year to 122 million. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year from 113.5 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 10.7% for the quarter versus 7.5% last quarter and 4.4% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margin driven by new product and customer mix and operating leverage driven by higher revenue along with disciplined expense control. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 10.7% for Q4 was also above our target model range of 5% to 8%. Other income and expenses approximately $1 billion in income consisting of 4 million in foreign exchange gain offset by interest expense of 2.9 million as compared to 4.7 million in FX gain and 1.5 million in interest expense last quarter. Our interest expense increased sequentially as we utilize our short-term credit line before financing inventory and accounts receivable. We also experienced higher short-term interest rates on borrowings driven by recent fed-ex. This quarter the tax provision was 25.8 million on a GAAP basis 29.9 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.1. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax expenses increased higher levels of pre tax profit, but though the rates were lower sequentially. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.3 million this quarter as compared to [Technical Difficulty] last quarter. We delivered strong Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS of 262, which exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of 151 to 169 and our recently updated range of 230 to 240. The increases to EPS were due to a combination of higher revenues, higher gross margins from manufacturing efficiency, price discipline, product and customer mix and operating leverage. For the full fiscal year 2022, we reported non GAAP diluted EPS of $5.65 which was up 128% year-over-year versus fiscal 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of 248 and higher than our initial guidance of 471. Cash flow used in operations for Q4 was 25 million compared to cash flow used in operations of 228 million for Q3 due to our improved profitability, along with better management of our inventory and working capital. Despite the 21% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenues, trimmed our inventory by 3% quarter-over-quarter. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to higher revenues, while accounts payable decreased sequentially due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Our CapEx was $11 million for Q4 bookings and negative free cash flow of 36 million versus negative free cash flow of 239 million last quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was 267 million while bank debt was 597 million, as we utilized our bank lines of credit for those higher revenues [Technical Difficulty] and accounts receivable as we ramped production of new design wins globally. As we look ahead to fiscal 2023, we expect that our continued growth in revenue and profitability together with improved working capital management leads to better operating and free cash flow. We're optimistic that some of the supply chain and logistic costs begin to stabilize. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms design win, market share gain and engagement with significant new global customers. We are announcing -- also attribute $200 million stock buyback program today [Technical Difficulty] through January 31, 1.4. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q4 cash conversion cycle was 100 days, versus 98 days in Q3 and above our target range of 85 to 90 Days. Days of inventory was 106 representing a decrease of 11 days versus the prior quarter of 117 that managed our inventory more efficiently. Day sales outstanding is up by three days quarter-on-quarter with 42 days, while days payable outstanding came down to [Technical Difficulty] by 10 days to 48 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we remain enthusiastic about design wins and plug and play flag sale total IT solutions ramping in multiple in markets. We're carefully watching the global macroeconomic situation, continuing supply chain disruptions for the first fiscal quarter 2023 ending September 30, 2022, we expect net sales in the range of 1.52 billion to 1.62 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.01 to $2.27 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share up to $2.07 to $2.32. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q4 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 126 million and they include 8.6 million in stock-based compensation 1.5 million in other expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase due to continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately 3.6 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, assume a GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% and a fully diluted share count of 54.8 million for GAAP and 56.2 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 be in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. For the fiscal year 2023, ending June 30, 2023, we are giving guidance for revenues in a range of 6.2 billion to 7 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $7.27 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.50. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income procurement tax rate of 20.3 and a rate of 21.1 for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 23, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 55.6 million shares for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal 2023 fully diluted, GAAP earnings per share includes approximately 35.4 million and expected stock-based compensation and other expenses net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per share. Now, Nicole, will turn it back to you.. Nicole Noutsios : Operator you can open the line up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Congratulations on amazing results. Amazing guidance clearly showing sustainable share gains story here. Let's talk about the gross margin, I think this is the first time I've heard Super Micro talk about better prices as a driver of gross margin expansion, which is great, but can you delve into why do you believe your existing prices for now versus in the past? David Weigand : Okay. So I missed just a little bit of what you said Nehal. You said what was the question? Nehal Chokshi : I believe, this is the first time I've heard you guys talk about price discipline being a driver of gross margin expansion. And so I'd like to understand why is that happening now? David Weigand : Okay. Got you. So, we have -- it took us some time to adjust to the rising freight costs and another component costs and so we managed to adjust those properly. And then, we also got some tailwind from finally from freight costs coming down 20% in q4. So those two things combined allowed us to have a higher gross margin. Charles Liang : Essentially our scale -- building scale continue to grow and we maintain a very good product line and also when building scale growth, yes, we will have a higher gross margin and net margin. Nehal Chokshi : Got it. Great. And then, can you give a little bit more detail on the driver of the -- strength in the quarter which was leading edge vertical solutions and OEM appliance in large data center segments? Charles Liang : Yes. Recently we have indeed handled four of really a good product win including most of them indeed high-end AI platform. So our AI platform continue to gain market share and especially rack-scale plug and play. We have a complete rack install customer so it's makes customers job much easier. And most of it and see what rack just starting to power cable then there are cable and then ready to run. So that really attract some customers. Nehal Chokshi : What about within the OEM side? Was the driver there on OEM side? Charles Liang : [indiscernible] indeed it's pretty much our standard product. Our standard product for customer, we want some really top 10 highest value company around the world. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. And then finally, what are your expectations for cash conversion cycle is the semi cycle appears to be entering a down cycle now? David Weigand : Well, we expect our cash conversion cycle to come down Nehal, for a couple of reasons. Number one, our profitability has been increasing. And secondly, we've been able to manage our inventories better. So and the reason for that is in Q3, we were building inventory as we were getting ready to start the launch of some design wins. And those design wins really, really got traction and that allowed us to kind of even out our inventory. So we expect our cash flow and cash conversion cycle to improve. Nehal Chokshi : Great, congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Yes, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on strong results and very solid execution. Thanks. Congrats on that. So I guess a few if I could. Kind of piggybacking of Nehal's question, like in a bigger picture context, are there any other kinds of key aspects of what you guys seeing going on this leading to the ongoing acceleration in revenue generation? And I guess, Charles, is it all share gain? Are there other things that you guys are seeing that's been leaving the last couple quarters to the accelerated revenue generation run rate? Charles Liang : Thank you. Indeed, we start to our folks on rack-scale total solution, rack-scale plug and play since the last three years ago, so it gets to the point where [indiscernible] to make an order, how do we and sort of where, from where people were chained. So now we start again started remodeling more deal, especially top 10 or top 30 highest [indiscernible] country around the world. So if we are very comfortable, we were convenient again, to win more in AI high-end platform and total solution, including storage, including switch, the kind of complete [indiscernible] or using rack-scale plug and play solution? Ananda Baruah : Hey, got it, I got it. So it sounds like it sounds like a big component in this share, and it is really continuing to resonate in the marketplace. Both of the total solutions and what you're able to actually provide to the customer with that total solution. So it sounds like it's just easier to use, and it's stronger product, those two things combined. And yes, I would just say, are you seeing parts of the marquee aspects of your end markets actually accelerate? Well, I guess I'd love to know, like, what's your opinion on kind of the tenor of demand in your key areas kind of the last 90 days versus the prior 90 days? It seems like you've actually seen some acceleration as the state from just shared gain. But how would you guys characterize that particularly in the macro backdrop? Charles Liang : Yes, actually you may know, I mean, AI, deep learning, being compared to grow, including metaverse, lots of customer, lots of company continuing to invest heavily in those areas. And it's for now we have -- I would like to say exactly that pace for AI platform around the world, doesn't matter, really high end, or all kinds of high volume platform enabled or rack-scale enabled or cloud enabled. So our investment in that three start to gain customers attention as we save their big time especially, most of the time in the industry, people take them maybe two miles to three miles to finish shipping, a rack scale, cluster, and it takes us much shorter, because we optimize the inventory and total solution and ship it to customer with a much shorter lead times and customer really appreciate that as well. Ananda Baruah : Sorry, no, I don't want to cut you off. That's great content Charles. I'll see [indiscernible] for now. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me? Charles Liang : Yes, Jon. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. The gross margins about 17%, the high-end of your range, is that sustainable over this year? And do you think that you should be changing your long-term target range a bit? David Weigand : The answer is, yes, it is sustainable. And we will be reviewing our new target levels. But it's really, as Charles mentioned, we've had a lot of customers come to us, and we've design very special solutions for them. And these solutions have a value. And they're high value to the industry and to our customers. And so we are -- when I say price discipline, and we've realized, higher value for some of our solutions. And we've had the good fortune of being able to secure enough supply to start to ramp up of those solutions. Jon Tanwanteng : That's great news. Thanks. And then, do you see any indications of your customers being impacted by recessionary pressures at all? And maybe go along with that what assumptions, if any, are in your guidance regarding macroeconomic or geopolitical risk? Charles Liang : It depends. Some customers, we saw them slow down, but not for other customer, indeed, continue to increase their demand, especially for high-end AI platform for those future products. And, by the way, I mean, there a lot of new technology, coming out quarter-out-quarter or month-after-month. So at this moment, we believe our macro economy may slow down at ADP, but our demand should continue growing. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. And the guidance that you gave for the next quarter that sequential decline at the midpoint? Is that more indication of just seasonality or supply? Or is it maybe more of this macro slowdown that maybe some of your customers are seeing? Charles Liang : Two reasons, one is supply chain. We still facing some supply chain constraints. Some parts have been more available than before last year, lots of past year in shortage that's one thing. Second thing, in our September quarter used to be our slow season. So both reason, and that's why we tried to be more conservative. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, understood. And last one if I may, just when do you need to think about investing in new capacity. I know you guys have up to 10 billion to 12 billion in your current facilities, but at your current growth rate, you probably have to start thinking about it pretty soon. So I was just wondering what your plans are, if you need to get there. And where you might start investing if you need to do so? Charles Liang : In addition to that, because we [indiscernible] really global market yet, we are very strong in some countries, some territory, but in other countries, we are still pretty mean. So our solution is able to grow with much higher scale. We just need more warehouse, more production, making power and then we can achieve a more productive customer as far as how we, are far away from where product assumption has been ready. And we haven't replicated the end market to more countries and we already are a premium product. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. And again, congrats on a fantastic quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Oh, God. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. I just love to get a little more context on the mix dynamic. Charles that you guys you talked about in his remarks, it sounds like meaningful aspects of the mix is a total solution. Are there any other components of mix that we should be aware of and contributing to that dynamic? Or is it primarily the total solutions that are resonating increasingly? Charles Liang : Very good question. Indeed, that's why we start to prepare, rack-scale plug and play about three years ago. So it took us -- acquired a lot of April to train our people to make it or facility or components ready, especially a street communication networking device. And finally every single ad we start to gain more customer, gain more design win. I believe those design wins will continue and at this moment, I feel pretty positive in the continued growth in those areas. Ananda Baruah : That's really awesome. And are there any particular verticals that those rack scales tend to go into or targeted at more, or that they'll resonate with more or just sort of across all your verticals? Do you think the rack scale has a real place? Charles Liang : AI, people learning, metaverse, omniverse and at the beginning, high end gaming, automation, scientific application. So it is a local area, even kind of lack of forecasting company, also having some strong demand. Ananda Baruah : That's super helpful context as always. Just, I guess, just let me up to two last quick ones here. Sounds like the backlog probably grew again, over the last 90 days, given your comment around constraints. Is that accurate? Charles Liang : Yes, because, they are not [indiscernible]. And that's why we keep in our inventory, so that we can support a continual growth demand. Basically, our image here is pretty healthy. We have some high volume inventory, but they are under strong demand. So like, at this moment, I don't worry about inventory level. Ananda Baruah : Great. And then last one for me, guys. Is Charles, just an update on Taiwan? How would you characterize the utilization level there now? Charles Liang : It\u2019s growing faster. But we always suffering supply chain shortage in that nine months, already. So I hope the supply chain will continue to get better. And once that happen, I reckon Taiwan can be much improved. At the moment, I believe our evaluation rate in Taiwan, only about 45% or so. Ananda Baruah : And so Dave? Dave, sort of 40 -- let's say 45% utilization. Does that mean when you guys get to sort of normalized utilization, which is still expected, Dave, what was it like 150 to a [indiscernible] before it's a gross margin contribution on top of where you guys are right now? David Weigand : From their shipments. Yes, that's right. We said 100 to 200 from Taiwan. Ananda Baruah : So 100 to 200 from Taiwan not 100 to 200. So it's not 100 to 200 to the overall P&L, it's 100 to 200... David Weigand : That's correct. Yes. Ananda Baruah : Got you. Now Taiwan is going to be approaching half year volume at some point. So would that sort of be long-term 50 to 100 basis points to the overall P&L. David Weigand : That's a fair way of looking at it. Ananda Baruah : Okay, awesome. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am very pleased to announce another fast growing quarter and a great start to our fiscal 2023. Supermicro is finally ready to do a big jump, for Green Computing and for being the best IT Total Solution company. Here are some key highlights for the quarter. First, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.85 billion, up 79% year-on-year; above our guidance range of $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion, with growth rate at about 10 times greater than the overall IT industry. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 490% year-over-year at $3.42 compared to $0.58 a year ago. It was well above the high end of our guidance range of $2.07 to $2.32. It was achieved by our leading designs, innovative products, our IT Total Solution, and our strong global operations. Especially, the growing utilization of our Taiwan facility is improving our ability to meet demand and making higher operating margin. Our plug-and-play Rack-Scale Total IT solutions and GPU-based systems have resulted in triple-digit percentage growth year-over-year. Along with excellent results from storage and 5G verticals, we are making solid market share gains. Growth in our major geographies skewed to the U.S. at 70% of total sales this quarter, driven by ongoing design wins from some of the top tier technology leaders. They recognize and accept the strong value proposition of our Green Computing technology and Total IT Solutions. We are off to a great start for fiscal 2023, and we expect our unprecedented growth momentum to continue. We are comfortably delivering quarterly revenue in the multibillion-dollar range, supporting our ambition of reaching $20 billion in the near distant future with a focus on increasing our profitability. Based on our current demand and capacity, we are forecasting $1.75 billion revenue for this December quarter, supporting our $7 billion annual revenue target for fiscal year 2023. We continue see opportunities for share gains across our TAM, especially with strong demands for our rack-scale Total IT Solutions and accelerated compute platforms. Despite already having the broadest server and storage portfolio in the industry, we are expanding our product lines by 25% in supporting our future growth. These additional new products will specifically be optimized for : number one, high-end AI workloads; second, 5G telco applications; third, accelerated storage systems; and number four, specific technology partner and top tier customer engagements. For the first time, we are offering standard OCP-optimized platforms and rack products. We are able to leverage our unique Building Block Solution designs instead of spending huge additional engineering, production resources and hardware/software investment. Combining our hardware Building Block Solution, advancing software, security and service features, our Total IT Solutions are getting ever stronger. To address the growing demand of Total IT Solutions, our manufacturing capacity in both Silicon Valley and Taiwan campuses continues to gear toward delivering more L10, L11 and L12 rack scale systems, including our new liquid cooled solutions. We are on target to scale our rack scale production capacity to 3000 racks per month in U.S. in the near future. We are also preparing to expand our rack scale Plug-and-Play solution in Europe and in Asia soon. Furthermore, as the component shortages start to ease, our ability to deliver our best-in-class solutions will begin to accelerate, giving our customers even greater confidence in our ability to service their IT needs. From a systems level perspective, we are ready to launch a full line of next generation products with technologies across our key partner ecosystem. For Intel, we are engaged with many large opportunities with Intel\u2019s upcoming Gen 4 scalable Xeon CPU codenamed Sapphire Rapids. We now have hundreds of early seeding engagements including several dozen early shipments. Similar programs have been executing with AMD, and we have seen very strong demand for our upcoming Genoa CPU based platforms. With respect to NVIDIA, not only do we have the most complete portfolio of systems supporting H100 GPUs, but we have also developed many brand new architectures for the leading Metaverse and Omniverse partners. At the upcoming Super Computing event, we will be showcasing many new systems supporting these latest CPUs and GPUs, including our next generation water-cooled rack scale plug and play solutions. We work closely with our customers, designing solutions that are both optimized for performance and efficiency, putting them on the path of Green Computing. From a financial perspective, Supermicro\u2019s Green Computing solution lowers customer datacenter TCO while maximize performance per kilowatt, increase compute capacity per rack, lower facilities costs while add location flexibility, in particular to power constrained regions with higher power cost. We expect to see elevated demand for energy efficient rack scale solutions across the tier-1 and tier-2 datacenter ecosystems. Thus, we now have enabled our popular SuperBlades, Twin product lines and some of GPU product lines to be fully optimized for liquid-cooling solutions and free-air cooling datacenter environment. Soon, we will start to offer fully redundant liquid cooling on the system level similar to its air-cooled counterparts for even more peace of mind. If half of the IT industry adapts Supermicro\u2019s Green Computing solutions or develops solutions as green as ours, together we can potentially save the industry up to $10 billion in electricity costs per year, which is equivalent of eliminating about 30 fossil fueled power plants. That is also equivalent to preserving eight billion trees for our planet. With planning in advance for green computing, indeed Green Computing can be free, with bonus! To summarize, we are emerging as one of the largest global suppliers of global IT solutions. There are some key factors that enable Supermicro to continue with its ability to make strong market share gains. First, our unique building block solution design methodology enables us to create optimized products from system level to rack-scale. Second, our IT Products Solutions strategy, including data center management software, security features, cloud stack and service, offers customers a peace of mind and quicker time to market while expanding our TAM. Our unique operation model, with business headquarters and campuses in U.S., Asia and Europe is pivotal in supporting these key growth drivers. Third, our Green Computing DNA helps our customers achieve much lower TCO while saving the Mother Earth. As I have mentioned earlier, Green Computing can be free with proper advanced planning, with a bonus that keeps paying back. With that, I expect our fiscal Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, and our fiscal 2023 should reach $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Looking ahead, I anticipate fiscal year 2024 revenue may reach the range of $8 billion to $10 billion considering the current economic headwind may last for many quarters. As we continue to gain IT market share with the best rack-scale Plug-and-Play IT Total Solutions, I believe we will soon become a $20 billion revenue company. Our business model has been optimized, our engineering teams are fully ready, and our worldwide campus production capacity and efficiency are now second to none. Let me not forget, I want to take a moment to thank our Super Micro employee teams, our suppliers, and our partners for their continued dedication to making Super Micro a market leader. Now I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer to provide additional details on the quarter. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report Q1 fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.85 billion, a 79% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter increase. Revenues exceeded our initial guidance range of $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion and our recently updated range of $1.78 billion to $1.82 billion. Our growth momentum continued with our rack-scale Total IT Solutions targeting growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU/AI workloads, software-defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud, and 5G/Edge/IoT Platforms. Our Green Computing Solutions helped us gain market share as customers valued both generating less carbon in our environment and reducing their operating costs. These growth drivers have resulted in accelerated revenues with expanding margins and operating leverage. In fiscal Q1, Super Micro again recorded strong revenues across all three of our market verticals demonstrating the value we bring to our end markets and customers. We achieved $840 million in our Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 45% of Q1 revenues versus 51% last quarter, that vertical was up 16% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth in this segment was driven by our new product offerings. Our OEM appliance and large datacenter segment achieved $921 million in revenues, representing 50% of Q1 revenues versus 44% last quarter. This vertical was up 268% year-over-year and up 28% quarter-over-quarter with strong growth coming from design wins from datacenter and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT Segment achieved $90 million in revenues representing 5% of Q1 revenues, which was the same as last quarter. This was also \u2013 this vertical was also up 58% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Our mix of complete systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has been increasing steadily. Systems comprised 92% of total revenues and was up 102% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter as we saw growing success with our high-value rack-scale Total IT Solutions for emerging applications. Subsystems/accessories represented 8% of Q1 revenues and was down 24% year-over-year and down 9% quarter-over-quarter as we prioritized our key customers with high-growth rack-scale applications. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASPs increased due to product and customer mix. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped decreased while nodes shipped and system node ASPs increased again due to product and customer mix. During fiscal Q1, we observed strength in the U.S. market with U.S. representing 70% of revenues; Asia represented 14%, Europe 13%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 131% as we gained market share with our advanced rack-scale Total IT Solutions for high-growth server workloads. Asia increased 3%, Europe increased 31% and Rest of World increased 78%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 21%, Asia decreased 4%, Europe increased 5%, and Rest of World decreased 5%. The Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 18.8%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q4 and up 540 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs and leverage from higher factory utilization. Our Q1 gross margin demonstrates the success of our high-value rack-scale Total IT Solutions. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 4% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-on-year to $127.4 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and increased 16% year-on-year to $117.3 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 12.5% for the quarter versus 10.7% last quarter and 3.7% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margins and operating leverage. Other Income & Expense was approximately $4.1 million in income primarily consisting of $7.8 million in foreign-exchange gains offset by interest expense of $3.9 million as compared to $4 million in FX gain and $2.9 million in interest expense last quarter. Interest expense increased sequentially as we reduced short-term credit lines while interest rates increased. The tax provision for Q1 was $38.9 million on a GAAP basis and $42.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 17.4% and non-GAAP tax rate was 17.9%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax expenses increased due to the higher level of pre-tax profits. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was a loss of $0.9 million this quarter as compared to a gain of $0.3 million last quarter. We delivered strong Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.42 which was up 490% year-over-year and up 31% quarter-over-quarter and exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.07 to $2.32 and the recently updated range of $3.05 to $3.20. The increases to earnings per share were due to a combination of higher revenues, higher gross margins from manufacturing efficiency, price discipline and operating leverage. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q1 cash conversion cycle improved to 95 days versus 100 days in Q4, still above our target range of 85 days to 90 days. Days of inventory was 100, representing a decrease of seven days versus the prior quarter of 106 days as we managed our inventory more efficiently. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially by $98 million from strong collections, while accounts payable increased sequentially by $130 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Days sales outstanding was down by three days quarter-on-quarter to 39 days while days payables outstanding came down by four days to 44 days. For fiscal Q1, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $314 million versus cash used in operations of $25 million last quarter. The positive operating cash flow was due to higher profitability along with better management of inventory and working capital. Revenue growth was 79% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, while inventory grew 47% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. CapEx was $10.8 million for Q1 resulting in positive free cash flow of $303 million versus negative free cash flow of $36 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $238 million, while bank debt was reduced to $250 million as we paid down $347 million in short-term debt during the quarter. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter and have $200 million in share repurchase authorization until January 31, 2024. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we are carefully watching the global macro-economic situation and supply-chain dynamics. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 ending December 31, 2022 we expect net sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.54 to $2.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.64 to $2.90. We expect gross margins to be down 75 basis points to 100 basis points due to competition from a strong U.S. dollar and macro-economic conditions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $133 million and include $11.8 million in stock-based compensation that is not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q2 due to continued investments in R&D and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense to be a net gain of approximately $1.6 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 17.4%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.9%, and a fully diluted share count of 55.7 million for GAAP and 57.0 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $7 million to $10 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023 we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $6.2 billion to $7 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share from at least $7.27 to a range of $8.50 to $11, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from at least $7.50 to a range of $9 to $11.30. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income assumes a tax rate of 19.2% and a rate of 19.8% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2023, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 57 million shares for GAAP and 58.4 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $32.7 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2023, we expect that our improved profitability together with good working capital management will lead to operating cash flow in line with net income. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins, market share gains and engagement with significant new global customers. Michael, we're now ready for Q&A. Michael Staiger : Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a really, really impressive quarter. My first question is just looking at the guidance and I know you raised this, but the midpoint still suggests you're anticipating declining quarters on average for the rest of the year. Is that express function of \u2013 an expectation of perhaps with a recession or macroeconomic pressure on your clients? Or are you thinking of specific customer programs there at the midpoint or is something else? I know in the past, you've put in a cushion there for what has been supply chain constraint. Just help us understand what you're thinking within the brackets of this year going forward. Charles Liang : Yes, very good question as the macroeconomic condition is how to predict at this moment look like there will be some headwind for sure. But with the coming soon several rapid new technology from Intel, AMD, Genoa and NVIDIA H100, so there are lots of new opportunity for us whenever the market have a new technology, Supermicro [indiscernible] chance to gain mark share. So with that, indeed, I believe our business in next 12 months should be not too \u2013 not too much impact. And also our business automation like in the last few quarters I mentioned about our auto configurator, our online automation that will help ourselves to service customer better. And with those offset the new product, the better tool, I believe our next 12 months business won't be too bad. Jon Tanwanteng : Great, thank you for that. And then the second question just with the really strong cash flow you have in the quarter and an expectation for future cash generation, what are your priorities there for cash usage? I know you mentioned you still have that share repurchase program, which you didn't use. Are there any CapEx plans or should we be thinking of any other things you may want to use the cash to invest in? David Weigand : So we haven't changed our CapEx allocation strategy. We still have a repurchase plan in place as market \u2013 and the board review that policy. And otherwise our CapEx for next quarter was listed as $7 million to $10 million and so we don't anticipate large increases in inventory. Charles Liang : And this year is, again, that's why I just mentioned so many new technologies coming. So we'd like to take this chance to continue to gain market share. So hopefully Supermicro [indiscernible] a $10 billion company and then $20 billion company. So we'll continue to focus on quickly growing the company market share and our position. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. One more if I could. Did you see any weakness in the quarter from any end markets or customers or geographies? Charles Liang : Yes. Generally a little bit kind of signal we need to observe that, but again new product, new technology that will offset this macro economy weakness. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Yes, thank you, amazing quarter, really impressive guidance shows strong visibility here. And I'm sorry I missed quite a bit of a conference call, so you probably already hit upon this, but what are you seeing on the supply chain side at this point? Charles Liang : Supply chain has been dramatically improved, as you may know, right. Three months ago, they have seen a shortage everywhere, but as of today, the shortage problem has been dramatically improved, so not much shortage at this moment. And we believe looking for growth in the coming quarters we won't have a shortage problem. After this, that won't be too bad and that's why we prepared to grow market share. Nehal Choski : Okay, great. At what point in time does you actually see the supply chain shortage more or less evaporate? Charles Liang : Indeed since quickly improved in about last two months. Nehal Choski : Okay, great. And then really incredible free cash flow generation, I haven't run through numbers yet to figure out how that was done given the strong growth. Can you just walk me through what was the driver of the strong free cash flow generation? David Weigand : Sure, absolutely. You can see our cash conversion cycle came down and that was a result of, we were able to speed collections and also we did receive some advance customer payments and we'll have a little bit more color on that in our 10-Q, which should be filed in the next few days. But we received about $70 million in advance payments from customers, so that helped us out. But still our cash flow from operations greatly exceeded our net income. Charles Liang : Yes. In that one month or three months, I mean we have some cash pressure, major because global shortage, so we had to keep large amount of inventory, now inventory program have been improved because no more big supply chain challenge now. Nehal Choski : Got it. Understood. Okay. And then Dave, did I hear you correctly that you expect free cash generation to be close to that non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2023? David Weigand : Yes. Nehal, that's correct, because we have our \u2013 inventories are a little more reasonable now. And then what I mean by that is the supply \u2013 some of the supply chain issues we have our cash flows are a little more imbalanced and so we expect cash flows to be a little more in line with income. Nehal Choski : Great. And then finally your updated low end of guidance implies and I think if we look at your prior low end of guidance implied that maybe you'd have a slightly negative year-over-year growth in the back half fiscal year 2023. Now this new updated guidance implies 10% to 15% revenue growth. So again, I'm sure you would stress this during the script, but what is driver of this improving growth outlook despite worsening macro that you're providing here at the low end of guidance by the way? Charles Liang : Again, the major reason is a macroeconomic condition. Because no one really know how long the economic headwind will last. So we try to be more conscious. Nehal Choski : Yes, understood. I guess my point is that the updated low end actually implies an improved year-over-year growth outlook on the back half of the year. This is despite a worsening macro. So what are you guys seeing that's effectively driving a raise in your back half revenue growth expectations? David Weigand : Yes, we really have \u2013 we have growth in all of our verticals, Nehal, and not only that but geographically as well. So as Charles mentioned, there's new CPUs coming out from AMD, from NVIDIA, from Intel, as well as relative new product launches. So we think that all of those, the momentum that we have in our verticals as well as the new product introductions is what gives us guidance to the numbers that we put up. Nehal Choski : Excellent. Fantastic job. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, thanks for taking my follow up. I was wondering if you were seeing any kind of impacts on the sanctions on China by the U.S. if there are any. I know earlier in the quarter, there's NVIDIA news; I know a lot of companies got added to the entry list where any of those are customers. How should we think about the consequences of those actions? Charles Liang : Yes, we see some impact for sure and exactly how long that impact we are lasting, we still keeping watch. David Weigand : Yes. So by the way, we didn\u2019t have any customers that were added, however, as everyone knows the GPU sales became limited. China sales last quarter were less than 3%. So we don\u2019t consider this to be a significant issue for us going forward. Jon Tanwanteng : Understood. Thank you. And then in your guidance, do you have any impact from foreign exchange built in there or possibly price declines as maybe you\u2019ve passed through declines in component costs as they occur. David Weigand : Most of our contracts are invoices are U.S. dollar denominated. We \u2013 our FX really comes from the fact that we have some Taiwan dollar denominated loans, and that\u2019s what causes the quarterly fluctuation in our FX is just marking the dollar to \u2013 the U.S. dollar to the Taiwan dollar. So therefore, the only impacts on FX come from really a price setting issues as opposed to balance sheet issues. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. Okay. And then lastly the strength in the quarter, did you observe any pulling or was it just more of the supply chain loosening up and being able to get more components and were there any push outs that you observed? David Weigand : So we didn\u2019t have any push outs. We had some customers, this will be in the 10-Q we had a couple customers who prepaid and whose shipments somewhat, which were made but were not \u2013 did not qualify for revenue recognition, others that would ship later. So that we didn\u2019t have any push out, so. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay. Great. Thanks, again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIGS. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups. Thanks for the update on the fiscal year and I just want to better understand how your system ASP would trend given the updated fiscal year 2023 revenue guides. I\u2019m asking because you have done a really good job in increasing content, it\u2019s captured in your system ASP, and I want to see if you would still be able to increase to see a system ASP increasing in double-digit figure. And I have a follow-up. David Weigand : So Mehdi, probably may have heard that a lot of GPU prices and CPU prices are going up, especially with the new the new refreshes that are coming out. So we anticipate that ASPs will continue to go up. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Would \u2013 for your fiscal 2022, it was more than 30%, should we assume the acceleration or would you be able to keep up the pace? Charles Liang : It\u2019s a big question. I mean again, they are lots of new technology, new CPU, new GPU, so that will be a positive side, but at the same time, the macro economy can be \u2013 can put in some negative impact. So at this moment, we try to play safe, so that\u2019s why the number I will share is relatively conservative. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. So that\u2019s good. A balance sheet question. And David, there was a line item. I think accounts payable also helped combine the $75 million of the prepayment. It helped with a positive cash flow operation. And in that context, how should I think about cash from operation in Q2 fiscal year 2023? David Weigand : Yes. So I think that I think my general comments apply that our \u2013 we see our cash flows as now more balanced with income \u2013 with net income. And so we\u2019ll get a \u2013 we\u2019ll have a few puts and takes where customers prepay more or less from quarter-to-quarter. But we went \u2013 we underwent a lot of heavy lifting Mehdi to get our revenue levels up and our AR levels up as we were growing. And so to the extent that we have more growth, we will face those challenges, but based on our current forecasts, we expect cash flows to be close to net income. Mehdi Hosseini : And then updated guide for CapEx in FY2023. David Weigand : So we haven\u2019t given a guide for FY2023 just for the next quarter. Mehdi Hosseini : Should I assume similar capital intensity as last year, just for modeling cash flows? David Weigand : I think we\u2019ll come out with a little \u2013 with more of a guide later on. Mehdi Hosseini : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing momentum and thanks for taking the question. I have a few falls tonight, so I may ask something that\u2019s already been addressed. If it is, we can just chat on it offline. But I would love just context on customer penetration, any new customer acquisition that was contributed to the quarter. And then any context you can give on what continues to be really, really good ongoing strength of those key application types that have been driving the business for the last number of quarters. Anything that you haven\u2019t given yet, I can take it offline with you or get out the transcript. Anything that I missed if you\u2019ve already talked about it, but there\u2019s any additional context, we love to get it. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yes, very good question. As I earlier just mentioned, we just introduced a couple of business automation tool, including auto configurator, including auto online, online service. So all of those were ahead of our sales, make our sales and customer relationship become more efficient, more accurate and we expect we are able to gain more customer, hopefully many more customer because of the improvement of our automation tool. Ananda Baruah : And Charles\u2026 Charles Liang : Again, with our much stronger storage product now, right, including all kind of data center management tool, our security tool and other service and applications. So yes, so we are in much stronger position from this point of view with our kind of large-scale total solution. Ananda Baruah : And let me ask a follow-up too. And this may \u2013 this is something that could have come up earlier as well on the call in your pay remarks or in the Q&A. Sort of upcoming Intel AMD and Nvidia cycles, should we think of those as being potentially meaningfully incremental to your business run rate or those sort of blended in? But they sort of just like blend into the run rate? Thanks. Charles Liang : For sure, customer will buy new product to replace that old product, right? But because we always have a stronger new product line, a new technology, that\u2019s how we expect we will continue to gain customer base and also improve customer relationship because of a stronger product. And not just the hardware product like before, but now our total solution have customer a lot. And GreenComputing as you know, our GreenComputing is a total solution. And we make for example, water cooling much easier and much quicker delivery time. So all of those we believe will be a positive drive for our business growth. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks, Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you. David Weigand : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Charles Liang, I turn the call back over to you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Thank you for joining us today and expect to meet you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Fiscal Q2 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. Mr. Michael Staiger, you may begin your conference. Michael Staiger : Good afternoon and thank you for attending Supermicro\u2019s call to discuss financial results for the second quarter, which ended December 31, 2022. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the Company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the Company\u2019s website. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, the Company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the Company\u2019s website under the Events & Presentations tab. We\u2019ve also published management\u2019s scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro\u2019s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal 2022, and other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro\u2019s website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today\u2019s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today\u2019s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today\u2019s presentation. At the end of today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce another outstanding quarterly result for Supermicro, driven by contributions across our diversified customers, end markets and strong products. No single customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of outstanding growth that effectively doubled our annual revenue. Let me share some key highlights for the quarter. First, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.803 billion, up 54% year-on-year, above our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 271% year-on-year at $3.26 compared to $0.88 a year ago, far exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $2.64 to $2.90. This great achievement is made possible by our much-improved operational and financial discipline, including our Taiwan campus that contributed lower operation and production cost. With the increase of AI applications, our Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale Total IT solutions and GPU based systems continue to be strong contributors with more than 100% year-on year growth. Storage products are also gaining significant traction with 41% year-over-year growth as we continued to grow market share. We are mindful that many of our partners and customers have become increasingly more cautious with respect to macroeconomic headwind, and we are prepared to deal with these uncertainties as we always have in the past. The strength of our products and business fundamentals keeps us confident in our ability to continue gaining market share from competition given in the traditionally soft Q3 quarter. We expect the headwind may persist in the first half of calendar 2023, but we believe our business will recover quickly in the second half of the year as our new Sapphire Rapids, Genoa product and H100 product lines start to ramp in high volume. Having said that, our fiscal year 2023 revenue year-over-year growth should be in the middle 30% compared with last year without changing our business plan for strong growth in the coming years. For fiscal year 2024, we are targeting year-over-year revenue growth of at least 20%. We continue to see new customers, increase demands for energy efficient rack-scale plug-n-play solutions across the tier-1, tier-2 datacenter ecosystems as well as other enterprise customers. Some of them are highly interested in our liquid cooling at the rack and system level for their green computing HPC, datacenter and cloud installations. In addition, our continuous investment in software, switch and service are paying dividends to our Total IT strategy as they grow. Our Silicon Valley and Taiwan campuses continue to optimize their rack-scale production processes, ready to deliver L10, L11 and L12 systems in volume with software, networking and services. Our U.S. facility still has 40% capacity while Taiwan still has 50% capacity headroom to grow for the next one to two years. To accommodate stronger growth in the near and midterm future, our recently broken-ground Malaysia new campus will start to contribute even better profit margin through economy of scale with our more and more new high-volume customers. I am very glad that the lower operation and production cost from our new Malaysia campus will be ready in just 4 to 5 quarters away. When the time gets tough, customers are looking for tangible value from their IT investment. With the power requirements rising with each new generation of technology, now up to 400 watts on the CPUs and 700 watts on the GPUs, we are seeing the true value of our Green Computing effort. We have added both high ambient temperature operation and liquid cooling support for the new portfolio to reduce environmental impact, cooling-related infrastructure costs and OpEx. We are happy to see many more cloud total solutions customers speeding up their deployments with our Green Computing methodology. Many of them have already saved tens of millions of dollars in electricity cost as a direct result. We expect them to grow even faster by the coming quarters and years as we deliver superior performance, performance per watt and per dollar through new generations of products. As I have shared in the past, when the IT industry adopts our Green Computing solutions or develop green solutions like ours, it\u2019s possible to save close up to $10 billion in electricity costs per year, which is equivalent of eliminating about 30 fossil fueled power plants and equating to the preservation of up to 8 billion trees for our planet. As we approach the second half of our fiscal 2023, we see opportunities for diversified growth across more Large Datacenters, Enterprise, AI, Machine Learning, Storage, Cloud, 5G/Telco and IOT markets. Our online B2C and B2B programs have finally started to ramp up and offers the convenience and quicker service of direct support from Supermicro to many customers around the world. With all the online automation and intelligent database-driven tools, we see many new customers that are really happy to order from our new platform. 24-hour around-the-clock services, real time responses, precise communication, cost efficiencies are just some of the advantages this program offers. With our industry\u2019s most extensive product portfolio supporting the recently launched Intel 4th Gen Scalable Xeon processors, Sapphire Rapids; 4th Gen AMD EPYC, Genoa processors; and NVIDIA H100, Hopper, GPUs, we are confident to maintain and enhance our market-leading growth momentum in the coming quarters and years. Unlike last few generation\u2019s steady product ramp up, we currently see many more customers taking samples and seeding units of these new solutions. This demonstrates our customer base is strongly expanding now. We expect them to become a significant revenue stream by the June quarter and more so in the September quarter and beyond. With market excited for the latest innovations from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and Supermicro, we remain optimistic that the demand will expand as new architectures developed for AI, Metaverse, Omniverse and IoT/Edge applications will be strong in the foreseeable future. We had a better than expected December quarter. With new generation of products in a strong position now, it will generate more demand, especially with our rack-scale solutions. Along with our getting stronger software, switch and service offerings, our potential to gain market share has never been stronger than today despite the macroeconomic headwind. With our strong cash position today, and especially total PE, [ph] we have allocated $200 million for stock buyback program. We continue to emerge as one of the largest global suppliers of Total IT Solutions with market share gains. We are a Silicon Valley company focusing on green innovation and system technology. Our efforts have saved our customers\u2019 OpEx tremendously. With our 50% still available capacity in Taiwan and the soon coming more cost-efficient campuses in Malaysia, we continue to expect a 20% to more than 50% year-over-year growth for the coming years, and we remain on track to reach our long-term growth objectives of $20 billion annual revenues in the long run. Now, I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. David? David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. I am pleased to report Q2 fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.8 billion, up 54% year-on-year and down 3% sequentially. Revenues were at the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and our recently updated range of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion. Our year-over-year revenue growth continued to be driven by new and existing customers widely adopting our GPU/AI systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions which contributed to solid gross margins and record operating margins. In fiscal Q2, we had good growth in our two largest verticals : enterprise/channel and OEM vertical -- I\u2019m sorry, the enterprise/channel vertical and the OEM appliance/large datacenter vertical, which demonstrated the resilience of our business model. AI/GPU accelerated computing solutions represented more than 20% of our revenues over the past four quarters and is a significant growth opportunity based on our wide range of AI/GPU platforms. We achieved Q2 revenues of $1.8 billion with no customer representing more than 10% of revenues. We recorded $970 million in our Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 54% of Q2 revenues versus 45% last quarter, up 29% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $766 million in revenues, representing 42% of Q2 revenues versus 50% last quarter, this was up 172% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter. Our emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT segment achieved $67 million in revenues, representing 4% of Q2 revenues versus 5% last quarter. Systems comprised 92% of total revenue and was up 68% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Subsystems/accessories represented 8% of Q2 revenues and were down 24% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as System node ASPs increased due to product and customer mix, while on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped increased while nodes shipped and System node ASPs decreased, again, due to product and customer mix. Taking a look geographically in fiscal Q2 the U.S. market represented 61% of revenues, Asia 18%, Europe 17% and Rest of World 4%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 71%, Asia increased 16%, Europe increased 45% and Rest of World increased 98%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 15%, Asia increased 23%, Europe increased 33% and Rest of World increased 33%. The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 18.8%, that was unchanged quarter-over-quarter and was up 480 basis points year-over-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs and leverage from higher factory utilization. Taking a look at operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased by 4% quarter-over-quarter and increased 8% year-over-year to $122 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 7% quarter-over-quarter and increased 5% year-on-year to $109 million. OpEx decreased sequentially due to higher NRE and marketing credits that we received from the new platform launches. The non-GAAP operating margin was 12.8% for the quarter versus 12.5% last quarter and 5.2% a year ago as we benefited from lower operating expenses. Other income & expense was approximately $8 million in expense primarily consisting of $6 million in foreign-exchange losses as the dollar weakened during Q2 and interest expense of $2 million as compared to an $8 million in FX gain and $4 million of interest expense last quarter. Interest expense decreased sequentially as we reduced short-term credit lines, this was partially offset by increased interest rates. The tax provision for Q2 was $30 million on a GAAP basis and $34 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 14.3% and non-GAAP tax rate was 15.3%. Our tax rates were lower sequentially as we benefited from favorable discrete tax benefits. Lastly, our share of income from our joint venture was a loss of $1.4 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $0.9 million last quarter. We delivered strong Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.26 which was up 271% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter and exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.64 to $2.90 and our recently updated guidance of $3.07 to $3.22. Our EPS outperformance was attributed to our ability to maintain gross margins, manufacturing efficiencies and higher NRE and marketing credits. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q2 cash conversion cycle was unchanged at 95 days versus Q1. Days of Inventory was 99, which is down by one day sequentially due to a more stable supply-chain. Accounts receivable increased sequentially by $32 million while accounts payable decreased sequentially by $225 million. Days sales outstanding was down by 1 day quarter-over-quarter to 38 days while days payables outstanding came down by 2 days to 42 days. In fiscal Q2, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $161 million versus $314 million in Q1. Our operating cash flow continued to benefit from strong revenues and margins and an improved supply chain. We note that Q1 operating cash flow benefited from $70 million in customer pre-payments recorded as deferred revenues. CapEx was $10 million for Q2 resulting in positive free cash flow of $151 million versus positive free cash flow of $303 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $305 million, while bank debt was reduced to $170 million as we paid down $80 million in short-term debt during the quarter. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter and have $200 million in share repurchase authorization until January 31, 2024. Our Board will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we continue to watch the global macroeconomic situation. Additionally, as the supply chain disruptions have eased and the industry transitions to new platforms from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA during 2023, we anticipate normal -- return to normal seasonal patterns. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ending March 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.75 to $2.02 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.88 to $2.14. We expect gross margins to be down 30 to 40 basis points due to macroeconomic conditions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $139 million, which includes approximately $12 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q3 due to lower R&D NRE credits and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $3 million and expect a nominal loss from our joint venture. The Company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.9%, and a fully diluted share count of 57 million for GAAP and 58 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance for revenues from a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $8.50 to $11.00 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $9 to $11.30. The Company\u2019s projections for GAAP annual net income assume a tax rate of 19.2% and a rate of 19.8% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year \u201823, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 57 million shares for GAAP and 58 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS excludes (sic) [includes] approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins, market share gains, and engagement with significant new global customers. Michael, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on the strong results, especially gross margin, and the guidance that implies very resilient gross margin. Dave, you did mention that you\u2019re expecting 30 basis points of the Q-over-Q downtick due to macro pressures. I mean, that\u2019s a de minimis amount. Can you discuss why only that amount? David Weigand : Well, Nehal, our margins are holding up. We expected a downtick last -- in this Q2, but it didn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re still allowing for a downtick just in case we have to sharpen our pencil on some particular deals. But otherwise our prices and margins are holding up. Nehal Chokshi : So then, can you talk about why you think your margins are indeed holding up in what appears to be pretty quickly deteriorating macro environment? David Weigand : Well, we have customers that are -- that have pushed out orders, certainly Nehal, but that we still bring value to our customers. And that value is -- has not diminished. And, in fact, with all of the new designs that are coming out, we believe it\u2019s increased. Nehal Chokshi : Got it. That\u2019s great. And then, you\u2019re maintaining your fiscal year \u201823 guidance despite outperformance in the December quarter and you\u2019re providing at least March guidance that\u2019s above my expectations. So, how should we be reading that implied June Q guidance, basically? Should we be -- if we take at the low end of the fiscal year \u201823 guidance, you could be looking at a pretty dire gross margin situation within June Q, is that the correct interpretation? David Weigand : No, I would say Nehal that really we are -- we don\u2019t want to update our guidance. We\u2019re confident in our guidance and in the ranges that we\u2019ve given. And so really we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re watching the macroeconomic situation. But we remain confident in our basic business fundamentals and in our values -- the values that our products bring. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So just to be clear, there is no reasonable basis for believing that gross margin would drop to the low-end of your what\u2019s arguably a sale target model of 14% to 17% in the June quarter, or lower, is that correct? David Weigand : So we -- right now, we don\u2019t see any degradation of our gross margins, as I mentioned. And so -- but we feel like -- we remain confident in our in our ranges. And we don\u2019t believe this is a time to update them. Nehal Chokshi : And then, Charles made a comment that he expects fiscal year \u201823 revenue be taking at least 30% year-over-year growth or mid-30%. But your overall fiscal year \u201823 guidance range is still a pretty large bracket. So, how should we be reconciling these two things here? David Weigand : Well, I think that number of mid-30s, that still falls within the range. Right, Nehal? Nehal Chokshi : Absolutely. David Weigand : Yes. So I think that\u2019s an indication. Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Yes, just a few if I could. So, maintaining -- actually, I think, slightly raising the midpoint of the fiscal year guide, March is below where Street is, the implication is June is above where Street is. And so, is it really just a matter of, kind of Street, like we are -- and I think I\u2019m part of this, sort of had miss-modeled March to the low side? And subsequently, we\u2019re also miss-modeling June? Well, we miss-modeled March to the high side, and we\u2019re miss-modeling June to the low side? Just a clarification. Just your thoughts on that and I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. David Weigand : Sure. So again, I\u2019ll kind of go back and we\u2019re -- because things have been changing economically and we had some -- we\u2019ve seen some push-outs, not cancellations, again, push-outs, we feel like, we shouldn\u2019t be adding more details on Q4 or annual guidance. And so, really, we feel like the guidance ranges that we gave allow for where we think performance will land. And so, to give more specificity to that, at a time when details are not easy to -- are not as clear to see, we think is the wrong way to go. And so instead, we\u2019re giving good guidance on what we see in the quarter ahead. But again, we\u2019re still comfortable with our annual guidance. Ananda Baruah : And it sounded -- I think, I believe Charles mentioned, and actually just please clarify this for me if this is inaccurate, something about kind of macro software, but recovery in the second half of calendar year \u201823. And if I heard that accurately, is that to say, you guys envision the first half of the calendar year being sort of the softest part of macro for you? And you also made comments Dave about returning calendar \u201823 to seasonality. And so first half is the soft spot, second half, you guys think sort of normal seasonality plus quote unquote, recovery begins and that dovetails into your fiscal year \u201824 outlook? And so contextually, I just want to ask you, is that how you guys are thinking about it? Charles Liang : Yes. Macroeconomic headwind issue is some concern to everyone now. So other than that, indeed, our demand is still pretty strong, especially as you know, Intel just announced Sapphire Rapids; AMD, Genoa; and NVIDIA, Hopper, H100. So we have very strong products available. And this time, we saw a customer very aggressively asking was simple for early seeding. So, we believe these were put in big growth. And -- however the very big growth in model should be in about summer or even after summer timeframe. So long-term, we have a very strong confidence, especially after summer. Before summer, depends on macroeconomic headwinds. We try to be more cautious. Ananda Baruah : Very helpful, Charles. And, Charles, last for me, I believe you mentioned potential for more large data centers in the second half of calendar \u201823. Did I hear that accurately? And are those incremental data centers, if I heard it accurately? And any more context you could provide around that? Thanks. Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, as you know, we start to approach large accounts since maybe one year ago. So, we continue to gain interest from those CSP and larger accounts. And that\u2019s why we increased having capacity for lower production cost to support those larger accounts. And we even started a big campus in Malaysia. So, the goal is to increase our production capacity and lower our operation and production costs, so that we are able to support those larger accounts with reasonable profitability. So, we continue to gain some engagement and interest from larger accounts around the world. And also at the same time, we also started to engage with lots of mini size accounts, especially those through B2B and B2C. So, we are engaging with much broader customer base now. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Couple of follow-ups. It seems like the price decline in the December quarter has more to do with the mix. And I am assuming that the OEM and large data center mix went down from 15, September to 42% in December. And in that context, my question to you is how should I think of the mix in the March quarter, and how will that impact unit and ASP trends? Charles Liang : In March quarter, because of the market headwind, so we still tried to be cautious. But after summer, our feeling become much stronger, because a lot of good products, lots of engagement from larger accounts, middle sized account and even small -- a lot of small accounts. Mehdi Hosseini : So, Charles, I just want to understand, would the mix of revenue from OEM and large data center decline again in the March quarter? Charles Liang : Yes. I would say. Yes. Mehdi Hosseini : And then, I also want to understand how you see the ramp of these three different CPUs. You have always -- you\u2019ve historically been a close partner of Intel, AMD and NVIDIA. How long in advance do you actually procure those components in advance of building the boxes? How much of the inventory commitment or working capital commitment do you have to make before the actual high volume manufacturing takes place? Charles Liang : Indeed we have a very close partnership with all of our vendors. So, in this area, I believe we are similar to the industry standard or slightly better. David, you may\u2026 David Weigand : Yes. Many things have improved recently, as you know, on the supply chain side. So, we used to procure further in advance. And so one of the reasons our inventories have come down, one of the reasons our cash flows have been -- have increased. And by the way, we had net income the last two quarters of $360 million, we had free cash flow of $454 million. And so, again, the reason for that is we had to invest less money in inventory. So, our ability to produce products is faster now, because we can buy later in the cycle. But to your point on the timing, some of it\u2019s going to be dependent on when in the quarter our customers are taking the bulk of their products. So, if we have early quarter shipments versus late quarter shipments, that can affect the timing of our inventory and accounts payable. Mehdi Hosseini : And then one last question for me on the balance sheet, especially with the Malaysia facility coming on line, are you still targeting, like a $45 million of CapEx for fiscal year \u201823, or more or less? David Weigand : Yes, so, fair question. So, we\u2019re going to add in -- for Q3, we\u2019re adding a $4 million of CapEx for Malaysia, and we\u2019ll add $9 million in our Q4, for Malaysia. So that\u2019ll be $13 million for our fiscal second half. And then, this is going to be an investment over a couple -- over several years. And so, we\u2019ll make another $13 million in the first half of fiscal \u201824. So, that\u2019s not -- that\u2019s given you a little more insight on that investment. Mehdi Hosseini : Should I assume that just the maintenance CapEx out to the Malaysia is what, $8 million to $10 million a quarter? David Weigand : Yes, that\u2019s correct. So, your question, yes, you can maintain the 45 and just add in the figures that I just gave you. Operator : Our final question comes from the Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Nehal Chokshi : Great, thanks. I get to leadoff and cleanup, awesome. So, relative to seasonal patterns, and excluding the 21.9% customer from the September quarter, how did the business actually perform in the December quarter then? David Weigand : So, the December quarter was an outstanding quarter on in every respect. And so from free cash flow, inventory, all the metrics were strong, cash position. So, as you mentioned, customer -- no customer concentration. And so, we feel we had a really good -- a really great quarter. Nehal Chokshi : I mean, my interpretation here is that the core business excluding that 120%-plus customer from the September quarter was up more than seasonal. Is that a correct interpretation? David Weigand : Well, we always have customers that will take -- when we have design wins, Nehal, we\u2019ll always -- from quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ll always have shipments -- large shipments to customers. Sometimes it\u2019s according -- sometimes they change their forecast, and we ship a little bit more in one quarter than another. So, we can\u2019t control that always. But as we said, as the supply chain has improved, that was -- that dynamic was felt a lot harder during the supply chain crunch. Now that we\u2019ve returned to a better supply chain, therefore, that\u2019s why we feel we\u2019ll return to more normal seasonality. But that can always be altered by a new design win that we get in one quarter or over two quarters. Charles Liang : Yes. Basically, in \u201822, we had some larger accounts, but in fiscal year \u201823, now we are adding more larger accounts. So we are growing in more largely accounts and more midsize accounts, and also B2B, B2C. So, indeed, our customer mix is becoming much more diversified, much more healthier, and for sure the volume will be bigger. That\u2019s why we extend to Malaysia for really lower cost operation and campus. Nehal Chokshi : Presumably, just diversification with the larger customers is coming on the higher margin plug and play rack-scale products. Is that correct? Charles Liang : We hope so. So anyway, that\u2019s -- we feel we still have a lot of room to add more customers. And once we have a higher capacity in USA, Taiwan, Malaysia, our plan is to add a lot of more customers. Nehal Chokshi : And then, is there a particular vertical that you guys are seeing the pushups from that -- that you were talking about for the quarter? [Ph] Charles Liang : Data center. Right. Nehal Chokshi : The Push-outs were not in data -- large data center? David Weigand : Well, he was saying that they were in large data center, but so\u2026 Charles Liang : In the large data centers? David Weigand : Yes. Charles Liang : Okay. All right. Very good. And then for the March quarter, you\u2019re guiding to an 18% Q-over-Q decline in revenue. There\u2019s clearly obviously some seasonality with March quarter. Then there might be, I guess, ongoing push outs from the large data center customers and then there\u2019s also a macro element. Are these the three major elements that are driving the 18% Q-over-Q decline? And then could you potentially help parse out what are rank order of these three drivers here? David Weigand : So Nehal, if you look back pre-COVID, our typical Q3 decline was 12%. Okay. So, that was during the time of normal seasonal patterns. During COVID, there was a different dynamic of course, because our supply was scarce. But we think as we return to normalized supply that we will have this kind of seasonality. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then, as far as the potential runoff of the large customer versus macro, any input as far as what\u2019s the driver there, as far as the above the 12% typical Q-over-Q decline? David Weigand : Well, we\u2019re engaging with new customers all the time. And so, we\u2019re not looking to be declining, and in fact, just the opposite. So, while we will have some seasonality as in a stable supply chain, we still have our growth plans that are intact and that we remain confident in. Nehal Chokshi : And then my last question here is, did I hear correctly that there\u2019s a new buyback that was implemented, something about $200 million buyback? Can you just clarify that? David Weigand : No, that\u2019s the existing, already approved buyback. Nehal Chokshi : So, now that you guys have worked yourself back to a net cash position with the strong free cash flow that you\u2019ve highlighted over past two quarters, is it reasonable to expect that you guys are going to put that back to work now? David Weigand : Yes, it\u2019s completely up to the Board, completely up to the Board. But, I think it\u2019s certainly unreasonable. Nehal Chokshi : We got one Board member here. Charles, your thoughts? Your thoughts on utilizing the buyback? Charles Liang : You know, as why I say, the PE is still low and cash flow is strong, why not? Operator : We have a question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. So, just a quick follow-up, just a clarification. David, did you employ or did you say that the 10% plus customers that you had in September quarter of last year is going to come back or you\u2019re going to have another 10% plus customer in the coming quarters? It was very confusing. David Weigand : Yes. So Mehdi, the 10% customer we had a year ago September is a different customer. Okay? The 22% customer that we had in the recent September quarter, again a different customer, was below was did not constitute 10% of our revenues in Q2. Okay, did I clarify that? Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. Just as a follow-up, do you expect that particular customer to come back, is that what the confidence behind the June quarter is? David Weigand : Well, we have -- so\u2026 Charles Liang : Indeed with our new product, indeed very strong offering. So we expect any time we will have a more new larger customer or old customer coming back is always very high possibility. And we are working with them very closely there, the partnership would come stronger ever. Mehdi Hosseini : This is dynamic. Charles Liang : Yes. David Weigand : We thrive on repeat business. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you for clarification. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. With that said, concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Incorporated Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. You may begin. Michael Staiger : Good afternoon. And thank you for attending Supermicro\u2019s call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2023. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company\u2019s website. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website under the Events & Presentations tab. We have also published management\u2019s scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro\u2019s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro\u2019s website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today\u2019s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today\u2019s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today\u2019s presentation. At the end of today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.28 billion, down 5% year-on-year and below our initial guidance range as we previously announced, but our non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 5% year-on-year to $1.63, compared to $1.55 a year ago. While the quarter did not unfold as we expected, I am strongly encouraged by our current business momentum as we navigate market uncertainties with our new generation X13, H13 and H100 leading-edge products, especially in artificial intelligence. These new AI product demands from top-tier companies have led us to challenges in terms of new key components availability. Compounded with the economic headwind, our Q3 results were reflective of these difficult yet opportune conditions. The good news is that we have already started to address these component shortage pressures over the past few months and we are in a much-improved situation going forward. We have started to produce and ship some back orders since April. Here are a few highlights for the quarter. First, record pace of GPU leading-edge design wins and growing back order, including winning at least two new global top 20 customers. Second, we refreshed our entire product portfolio based on new CPU, GPU, Storage and Fabric technologies from key partners including NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and others. And third, increased customer demands of our rack scale PnP solutions and continued expansion and transition from a server/storage hardware manufacturer to a Total IT Solutions provider. With applications like ChatGPT that heavily count on large language models or LLM and generative AI, the state of AI infrastructure business has grown rapidly. This AI momentum has benefited Supermicro greatly as we are deploying many of the world\u2019s leading and large-scale GPU clusters. In addition, we have built a close and collaborative relationship with NVIDIA over the years by co-developing and offering the most optimized and the fastest time-to-market GPU platform on the market. Aligning new generation product designs with partner ecosystems is highly complex. As I mentioned earlier, multiple key component shortages delayed our ability to manufacture and deliver the new systems like the Delta Next GPU system last quarter. With the improving components availability this quarter, the new GPU system shipments will ramp significantly. Indeed, we continue to scale up our manufacturing campus in U.S., Taiwan, Netherland and Malaysia, so that we can support our revenue growth in a much larger scale in the coming quarters and years. By leveraging our in-house Building Block design and manufacturing, we are well equipped to navigate through the current economic headwinds. With our building block solutions architecture, we always deliver workload optimized new products to market faster than competitors, like with the recent NVIDIA H100, Intel Sapphire Rapids and AMD Genoa releases. The power consumption and thermal challenges of these new technologies have risen dramatically and 40KW or even 80KW rack solution demands are getting stronger and popular for computing hungry DC and industries. Having high power efficiency and air/liquid thermal expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. Combined with our proven green computing pedigree that saves customers much TCO costs, our time-to-market advantage and solution optimization via building block solutions, we anticipate to continue to gain many more new design wins with these new generation products in the quarters ahead. We have made solid progress in our Total IT Solutions initiative by advancing our rack-scale solutions capability. Provided there are no supply constraints, we can design, build, validate full systems and deliver turn-key rack level solutions to customers within a few weeks of placing an order instead of months from competitors. Supermicro\u2019s one-stop shop Total IT Solutions strategy includes AI, servers, storage, networking, software, racking, cabling, power, cooling, integration, validation and management features plus services. The idea is to let our customers focus more on their applications and new software functions, leaving the IT hardware solutions to Supermicro from cloud to edge. Currently, we are on track to support up to 4,000 racks per month of global manufacturing capacity by the calendar year end. Our business is maintaining a growth rate that is multiples of the overall IT growth rate worldwide in the same period. We are doing so by efficiently taking market share in the new and fastest growing markets. AI, Storage, on-prem Cloud, Embedded and 5G Edge are all verticals we see potential to greatly increase our TAM. We are well positioned to support these highly specialized markets by optimizing our technology, design and business automation at our U.S., Asia and EMEA campuses. The recently added liquid-cooled rack-scale solutions and production lines, product auto configurator and online business automation will bring more value to customers quicker with better quality. We are also improving our cost structure by scaling our Taiwan and upcoming Malaysia campuses, which will be online soon with some of our key partners. While our March quarter results had some challenges, our new generation of products are in high demand, especially for AI and we anticipate more customers deploying our products in rack-scale PnP. We continue to emerge as one of the largest global suppliers of Total IT Solutions and continue to gain market share. The strength of our products and technology keeps us confident of delivering Q4 revenues in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. If supply conditions improve sooner, we expect to be above that range, despite some economic headwinds ahead. In other words, I continue to expect our fiscal year 2024 revenue to be at least 20% year-over-year growth and we are accelerating to reach our mid- to-long-term growth objectives of $20 billion per year. Now I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3, 2023 revenues were $1.28 billion, down 5% year-over-year and down 29% quarter-over-quarter, which was below our initial guidance range of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion. The shortfall was primarily due to key new component shortages for Supermicro\u2019s new generation server platforms which have been mostly resolved to-date. Our next generation AI platforms are driving record levels of design wins along with strong orders from top-tier customers and a record backlog. We are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year 2023 as we rank up -- wrap up -- ramp up deliveries of our new platforms to key customers. We note that our shipments against a record backlog may be constrained by supply chain bottlenecks due to high demand for our advanced AI server platforms. Q3 results were driven by our high growth AI/GPU and rack-scale solutions which represented approximately 29% of our total revenues and we expect significant future growth. An existing Cloud Service Provider customer represented more than 10% of revenues for the first time. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, key new platform component shortages and seasonality impacted our three end market verticals. On a year-over-year basis, we had growth in our OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical reflecting momentum with new datacenter and CSP customers. We recorded $646 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 53% last quarter. This was down 22% year-over-year and down 32% quarter-over-quarter due to new platform component shortages. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $601 million in revenues, representing 47% of Q3 revenues versus 43% last quarter. This was up 30% -- 37% year-over-year as we gained momentum with existing and new datacenter, CSP, and OEM cloud appliance customers and down 23% quarter-over-quarter due to new platform component shortages. Our emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT segment achieved $36 million in revenues, which represented 3% of Q3 revenues versus 4% last quarter. Systems comprised 91% of total revenue and was up 2% year-over-year and down 30% quarter-over-quarter. Subsystems/accessories represented 9% of Q3 revenues and were down 43% year-over-year and down 16% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped decreased while System node ASPs increased due to higher product ASPs, especially for AI product offerings. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped decreased due to lower shipments from component shortages while system node ASPs increased.  Geographically, during Q3 the U.S. market represented 61% of revenues, Asia 17%, Europe 18% and Rest of World 4%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia decreased 31%, Europe increased 11% and Rest of World decreased 29%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 28%, Asia decreased 35%, Europe decreased 27% and Rest of World decreased 20%. The Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.7%, down 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 210 basis points year-over-year. The decline in the non-GAAP gross margin was due to, one, our efforts to gain market share in the rapidly growing AI server platform market with aggressive pricing targeting strategic large enterprises, data center and CSP customers; secondly, lower factory efficiency from smaller sales volume and a learning curve in the production ramp of new platforms. The company\u2019s mainstream server business margin profiles were generally on par with last quarter. As we focus on gaining market share with our new AI platforms, we will target the optimal mix of revenue growth, gross margin and operating profit growth to create long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to operating expenses, Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter and increased 5% year-over-year to $127 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 7% quarter-over-quarter and increased 6% year-over-year to $116 million. OpEx increased sequentially due to lower NRE and marketing credits for new platform launches and higher headcount. The non-GAAP operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter versus 12.8% last quarter and 7.5% a year ago due to lower revenues and lower gross margins. Other income and expense was approximately $1.4 million in expense primarily consisting of interest expense of $1.3 million and a small FX loss, as compared to $1.8 million in interest expense and $6.3 million FX losses last quarter. Interest expense decreased sequentially as we paid down some of -- some working capital loans last quarter. The tax provision for Q3 was $11 million on a GAAP basis and $15 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 11% and non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our tax rates were lower sequentially due to higher discrete tax benefits realized in Q3. Lastly, our share of income from our joint venture was a loss of $1 million this quarter, as compared to a loss of $1.4 million last quarter. We delivered Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.63, which was up 5% year-over-year and down 50% quarter-over-quarter due to the lower revenues, lower gross margins and higher operating expenses quarter-over-quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 126 days versus 95 days in Q2. Days of inventory was 126, which was up by 27 as we built inventory to fulfill large new customer orders. Days sales outstanding rose 13 days quarter-over-quarter to 51 days, while days payables outstanding increased by nine days to 51 days. Working capital metrics were impacted by the -- again by the new platform component shortages, which increased inventory and lengthened the cash conversion cycle as we could not fulfill all our sales demand. In fiscal Q3, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $198 million versus $161 million in Q2. Despite our Q -- quarter-over-quarter revenue decline, our operating cash flow benefited from continued profitability and the conversion of accounts receivables to cash. CapEx was $8 million for Q3 resulting in positive free cash flow of $190 million versus positive free cash flow of $151 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $363 million. Total bank debt increased to $187 million as we increased our debt by $17 million during the quarter, while net cash increased to $176 million in Q3 from $135 million in Q2 due to strong operating cash flow. During Q3 we repurchased 1.55 million shares of our common stock for approximately $150 million leaving $50 million remaining under our current $200 million share repurchase authorization which goes until January 31, 2024. Our Board will determine the timing and amount of any future share repurchases. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we have a strong backlog of orders for new platforms entering the seasonally strong June quarter. We are working diligently with our strategic partners and customers to fulfill their requirements and are making steady progress in easing key supply constraints. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 which ended --ending June 30, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.13 to $2.65 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.21 to $2.71. We expect gross margins to be approximately 17% as we focus on gaining market share with our strategic new customers and platforms. As we improve our production efficiencies on the new platforms and gain scale with our customers, we expect our gross margins to improve. However, in the current AI growth, AI market environment, we will continue to balance market share gains with gross margins. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $145 million, which includes approximately $10 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q4 due to lower R&D NRE credits and higher personnel and marketing costs. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $4 million and expect a nominal loss from our joint venture. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 14.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.7% and a fully diluted share count of 56 million for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $7 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023, we are tightening our guidance for revenues for a range -- from a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion to a range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 27% to 31%. GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $8.50 to $11 to a range of $10.14 to $10.66 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $9 to $11.30 to a range of $10.50 to $11. The GAAP -- the company\u2019s projections for GAAP annual net income assume a tax rate of 14.9% and a rate of 16% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2023, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 56 million shares for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. For fiscal year 2024 we are expecting revenue growth of at least 20% based on strong customer demand for our best-in-class new AI platforms and Total IT solutions. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins with significant new customers, our efficient global manufacturing capacity and continued market share gains. And Michael, we are now ready for Q&A. Michael Staiger : Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah. Thank you. Very impressive buyback rate of $150 million in the quarter to $100 a share. So a very strong statement that the shares are attractive prices and nice to see that backed up with the $1.5 to $11 share fiscal year 2023 guidance. So, with that in mind, on the at least 20% year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, what\u2019s your level of confidence that Supermicro can operate at the high end of the target model that you guys communicated two years ago, that being the 14% to 17% gross margin range? David Weigand : So\u2026 Charles Liang : Yeah. Indeed our confidence is very good. So, again, because of the economic headwinds, so we try to be more conservative here. But at least 20% year-over-year growth and we expect -- we hope more than that for sure. Nehal Chokshi : And what about with respect to gross margin? David Weigand : Yeah. So, Nehal, we -- yeah. Back two years ago, we gave a 17% to 21% -- 23% topline growth. Obviously, we\u2019re in there at a minimum of 20%. And for the gross margins, we continue to, like I said, to wrestle with taking market share and also balancing that against gross margins. But we\u2019re confident with our new manufacturing facilities coming online that we will be able to improve our gross margins. And we also, as we come out of this quarter and we begin to ramp our new product offerings that we will be able to improve margins as well. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Great. And are you guys seeing any signs of general corporate IT demand weakening -- weakness as the CDW preannounced has indicated? Charles Liang : Yeah. The general IT market has slowed down a little bit, but this year we have a lot of high-end high computing, especially GPU product line that we saw a very strong demand. So, overall, our growth will be strong. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then do you guys have any 10%-plus customers in the quarter and any expectations that, that would contribute within the June quarter as well? David Weigand : So we did have a new 10% customer this quarter. They\u2019re not a new customer, but they\u2019re a new 10% customer. And we expect from time -- from quarter-to-quarter, Nehal, depending on the delivery of these -- of our design wins, we will see other customers over -- achieve over 10% of our revenue. So that will continue to happen. Nehal Chokshi : And is that the expectation that there will likely be a new 10% customer pop up within the June quarter? David Weigand : It\u2019s very possible. Charles Liang : Yeah. But at the same time, we are also greatly growing our operating NIM through our channel, through retail and also through online business. So we try to balance the growth between the large accounts and a lot of small account. And so we are\u2026 Nehal Chokshi : Thank you, guys. Best of luck. Yeah. Great. Best of luck, guys. Thank you very much. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups for me. I want to better understand. I remember last earnings conference call, you discussed your confidence in the backlog, and back then, there was a little bit of a pushout of revenue opportunities from perhaps March into June, but you were very confident that as we approach June and September, it should materialize and now that the magnitude of the revenue push was more than expected. So what happened if you if you were confident with the backlog in January, what prevented you to procure the key components? And I have a follow-up. David Weigand : Sure. There was a shift -- there was a dramatic shift toward new AI solutions, Mehdi. And so therefore, it was larger than anyone expected and so the parts availability constrained the amount of shipments that we could do. Obviously, we anticipated a slower quarter, because the third quarter is seasonally slower and we also mentioned -- you\u2019re correct, we also mentioned some customers that tapped the brakes and moved out to Q2. But it was really the component shortages that hit us this quarter. Charles Liang : Yeah. I\u2019m going to Q1, we have some customer postponed shipping right? But at the same time, some other customers growing and they want a high-end, especially GPU product line. And for those high-end GP product line and new design, yes, we have some key component shortage, including GPU/CPU combination and kind of high power thermal solution. So we did a very big effort to prove in those components and now situation have been dramatically improved. That\u2019s why we are pleased for June quarter. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you for details. And David, one that cash flow items. In the December quarter, you were able to work down inventory, but then there was one non-working capital item, which caused the decline in cash from operation, and this quarter, March, it was actually the other way. You had to purchase inventory, but there was a non -- there was positive non-working capital item that came in. Can you help us understand how I should think about these dynamics in working capital and how is it going to change looking forward? David Weigand : Yeah. I think, as we go out, Mehdi, I think, that\u2019s a good question, because we will -- working capital wise is this fourth quarter is going to be challenging for me, because we are going to be moving -- acquiring a lot of inventory. And so it will -- that will challenge our cash flows during this quarter. So that\u2019s something -- the timing of inventory and shipments is critical. And as going into this Q4 or ending Q3, we were building inventory, and yet at the same time, as Charles mentioned, we couldn\u2019t ship things, because we didn\u2019t have every -- all the parts that we needed. So we\u2019re growing inventory at the same time that we\u2019re constrained on shipping. So what that does is it caused our working capital metrics to go down a little bit and that\u2019s evident in our cash conversion cycle. But I would say that in spite of that, we generated some of our best cash flow. We generated $200 -- almost $200 million in cash flow and we returned $150 million of that to the shareholders. So, what I would say is that, yeah, going into Q4, we -- cash flow is very important. But, I think, ultimately, the business has shown that it generates very good cash flows. Charles Liang : Yeah. Although, like David said, recently cash flow a little bit high, but will be very safe. I would have to say, we will be super safe and a little bit tight, because we would pay -- purchase a lot of components for growing June quarter and following the September quarter. I believe June and September quarter will be very strong, especially September quarter, we would say. So we had to prepare components and that\u2019s why cash flow will be a little bit high, but will be super safe. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you. I will go back in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I really appreciate it. Two, if I could. At the risk of asking maybe the, obvious, I think, 90 days ago, you guys had, Charles said on your earnings call that, you had expected in the second half of this calendar year. So September, December quarter to be in a position to start -- this is the way that I interpreted Charles, making a regular part of your book of business, the layering in of larger projects from the cloud cadre from the AI cadre, like that. And I guess my question is, are you seeing -- is what we\u2019re seeing in the June quarter that you\u2019re talking about, is that a pull forward of what 90 days ago we anticipating later this year? So is that dynamic happening sooner kind of as you would describe it holistically or is this something different than that? And then I have a follow-up. I appreciate it. Thanks. Charles Liang : Very good question. Indeed, the June quarter, our demand is very strong, because of the component shortage. So, at this moment, we try to be conservative. So that\u2019s why we share with you $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. That\u2019s based on some shortage. If we can find those parts quicker than indeed the June quarter will be much stronger than that. And September quarter, likewise you say, what -- likewise your question is September quarter, we will continue to be very strong, and as well as the December quarter, I believe. So now that really problem is a shortage. So we had to build other components for inventory. At the same time, we are not quite sure how much we can grow in this quarter. But for sure, $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion should be a very safe number. Ananda Baruah : Really appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful context. And then I guess the follow-up is for Dave -- Dave, for you. Just with regard to your gross margin comments. Any greater context you can share that\u2019s responsible. I realize that this is sort of at the front end of beginning to mix in some of this larger footprint business. But I would love to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about sort of the gross margin manifestation if we think about the continued layering in of larger footprint, which may come at a slightly lower margin. Is it really that over time, we just expect a greater presence of that lower margin business with some efficiency gains or is it just in the beginning here, the margin will be lower for the new business, but then collectively, the P&L gross margin expands over time? David Weigand : Yeah. So we\u2019re looking at it and on -- in the -- your latter alternative, Ananda, and here\u2019s why. So right now, there\u2019s three things that we\u2019ve been facing. We\u2019re having to face more air transportation costs in order to make our deliveries. So that impacts our margin. And also, we\u2019re having to pay other expedite fees. That impacts our margin. Number two, we ran a lot less through our factories than in Q3 than we did in Q2. So your margin efficiency, your ability to spread your fixed costs, it\u2019s tremendously impacted on a smaller scale. So as we scale up, we improve our margins. Thirdly, the -- as we ramped our new product offerings, there is an efficiency on these new -- on the production of these new products. So we are going to improve the efficiency of these products, which will improve the margin. And so those three things alone speak to margin improvements. But again, we are -- we have -- we believe we have best-of-breed AI products. And those are in high demand and people are coming to us and so we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re very strategic about taking the market. Charles Liang : Yeah. Ananda Baruah : Great. Thank you. Charles Liang : I can add some color. I mean, as I shared, I mean, we are building a $20 billion of revenue, hopefully in midterm and that\u2019s why a grow our capacity and support a large customer is very important to us. Once our volume becomes higher, our costs will be improved and then business operation efficiency will be higher. So we are doing better great way to grow our revenue. And so, I mean, once we start to reach that number under $10 billion to $20 billion, I guess, our gross margin will start to grow, because we won\u2019t always invest for big growth after that. Ananda Baruah : I appreciate that context guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take follow-up questions from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. A couple of follow-ups. David, did you say that the OpEx for the June quarter will be around $145 million? David Weigand : Let\u2019s see. That sounds about -- on a non-- we have -- we gave both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, Mehdi. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. David Weigand : So our... Mehdi Hosseini : Let\u2019s see, the non-GAAP was $145 million. David Weigand : Yeah. Let\u2019s see. Just a second. Yeah. Yeah. $145 million for GAAP. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. David Weigand : Sure. Mehdi Hosseini : I\u2019m sorry, GAAP or non-GAAP. David Weigand : It was -- GAAP is going to be $145 million. Charles Liang : Yeah. David Weigand : And that includes $10 million in expected stock-based comp. So that would -- that means $135 million for non-GAAP. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Okay. And then CapEx for the June quarter? David Weigand : Yeah. We said $11 million to $14 million. Mehdi Hosseini : $11 million to $14 million. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce a new record fiscal result of $7.12 billion annual revenue, a 37% year-over-year growth rate. We have also achieved our first landmark $2.18 billion quarter, which is 34% growth year-over-year and 70% quarter-on-quarter. We are continuing to exceed both top and bottom-line results and performing well beyond our previously guided ranges. It\u2019s no secret that our strong growth has been driven by the demand for our leading AI platforms in plug-and-play rack-scale, especially for the large language model-optimized NVIDIA HGX-based Delta Next solution. Our engineering capability enabled us to deliver optimized, first-to-market AI products and solutions to our customers, distinguishing us from the competition and empowering us to take market share.  I am also proud of our logistics and production teams\u2019 execution to maintain our time to market advantage and deliver our total solution to our key partners much sooner than competition. Our investment of 4,000 racks-per-month state-of-the-art validation and production facility in Silicon Valley is one of the major factors in delivering high-performance AI racks quickly with both air-cooled and liquid-cooled options. Let\u2019s go over some key financial highlights : We enter FY24 with record-high backorders, many more new design wins and new customers. Again, our fiscal year 2023 net revenue totaled $7.12 billion, up 37% year-on-year, above our mid-point guidance range of $6.7 billion. Fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share grew 109% year-over-year to $11.81, compared to $5.65 a year ago, exceeding the higher end of our revised guidance range of $10.50 to $11.00. Fiscal Q4 net revenue totaled $2.18 billion, up 34% year-on-year and up 70% quarter-on-quarter, above our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $3.51 per share grew 34% year-over-year compared to $2.62 a year ago, and it was well above the high end of our guidance range of $2.21 to $2.71, demonstrating strong operating leverage and continued customer preference towards our rackscale Total IT Solutions.  For 30 years, we have been diligently building our company strength and foundation. As the only U.S. -based scale AI platform designer and manufacturer, we have been shipping our winning products in volume to our partners for more than a quarter.  Couple of months ago, I was honored to have my close friend, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, join me on stage at Computex to highlight our optimized new generation GPU solutions for this AI era. We are deploying not just systems, but complete rack-scale total solutions to large generative AI innovators. Supporting HGX H100 Delta-Next, H100 PCIe GPUs, and the just-announced L40SGPUs; our Delta-Next, Redstone-Next, and 8-GPU OVX systems have become the benchmarks of excellence for the industry. We are also getting good traction on Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 and PVC, as well as AMD\u2019s MI-250 accelerator solutions. The demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure is perfectly addressed by our building block server architecture, and due to our building block solutions, we have the best and broadest application-optimized GPU solutions on the market. We plan to extend this leadership with the upcoming MGX platforms that we announced at Computex, bringing modular flexibility on acceleration with X86, Grace, C2 and Grace-Hopper CG1 Superchip. The MGX platform is a shared vision of AI computing between NVIDIA and Supermicro, designed to be open, flexible and future proof for multiple generations of GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. We already have many customers engaged with these new MGX platforms as we speak, and soon they will be in volume production.  With nearly half of our revenues this quarter based on AI-related designs, I expect this AI growth momentum to continue expanding our TAM across all customer types from major AI innovators, super large CSPs, Tier 1 DCs, Tier 2 cloud, and to the general enterprise market. As the performance of GPU, CPU, DPU and memory technologies increase, enhanced storage performance is also necessary to feed massive data sets to the applications without becoming a bottleneck that slows the entire system down.  Supermicro's new PCIe Gen 5 based E1.S and E3.S Petascale All-Flash storage servers offer industry-leading storage performance and capacity. Together, with our U.2 NVMe, top-loaded scale-out and traditional storage platforms. We are fulfilling customers\u2019 AI, compute, and storage needs with a one-stop total solution shopping experience, with the best optimization in performance, time-to-online, and cost. With accelerated computing and storage, the power consumption and thermal challenges of these new technologies have risen dramatically. 40KW or even 100KW rack solution demand is rapidly expanding and required for compute-intensive DC, CSP, and other verticals. Having high power efficiency, free-air and liquid cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. We have made major investments across a variety of technologies to drive adoption of direct liquid cooling in datacenters to address the thermal challenges.  In addition to increasing computing density and reducing TCO, liquid cooling reduces the environmental impact of datacenters dramatically, aligning with our green computing mission. Similarly, our liquid immersion solution is making good progress, and we will be happy to provide that option to interested partners soon. The reality is that datacenter infrastructure is getting more complex, especially with the unprecedented demand for AI. The design complexity and integration skills, along with the requirement to deploy in a timely fashion are heavy burdens to many end customers. Supermicro Total IT Solutions approach saves them from the complications of design, validation, sourcing, and integration. It also streamlines network switching, firmware and software management in datacenter scale. Customers\u2019 peace of mind is topped off by the value of our 24/7 Global Service tiers.  Given the current infrastructure demand, we have been continuing to evaluate our footprint beyond our recently announced Malaysia expansion. We have recently added another new building close to our Silicon Valley HQ and are aiming to further increase our current 4,000 rackper-month capacity in this fiscal year. To further support demand from key domestic partners. We are also planning to build another manufacturing campus in North America. At this moment, our U.S. headquarter and Taiwan facility can support at least $15 billion in revenue while the new Malaysia facility will further increase our total revenue potential by serving scale builds on a reduced cost structure in the coming CY'24. In closing, Supermicro is in a great position to continue our growth momentum with our leading AI portfolio, our infrastructure readiness, and our ability to deliver products in a timely manner. Due to the current key components supply shortages, we forecast revenue in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion for the September quarter. However, given the record high backlog, we see fiscal year 2024 revenue between $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion with room to deliver more depending on availability of supply.  Our role as the leader of rack-scale Total AI and IT Solutions has only just begun. We are ready to deliver optimized AI infrastructures to existing and emerging markets, along with our value-added software and services. To say it plainly, our foundation and capacity are fully ready, and our demand is growing strongly. With LLM large language model and other AI applications booming, I now expect the $20 billion annual revenue target to be just a couple of years away.  Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to say thank you to our partners, customers, Supermicro employees and to our shareholders for your continued support.  Thank you, David. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.18 billion, up 34% year-over-year and up 70% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 revenues exceeded initial guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and were at the high end of the recently updated range of $2.15 to $2.18 billion.  For Fiscal 2023, we reported revenues of $7.12 billion, representing 37% growth over FY'22 revenues of $5.20 billion. Next generation CPU and AI platforms continue to drive record levels of design wins and orders. Exiting fiscal year 2023 with a record backlog, we are well positioned for fiscal year '24 with an outlook for continued revenue growth and profitability. We expect diversified growth driven by top-tier datacenters, emerging CSPs, enterprise AI build-outs, CPU upgrades, and edge IOT and telco markets. We are also targeting new opportunities in adjacent markets such as Storage, Switches, Software & Services. We note that our shipments against a record backlog may continue to be constrained by supply chain bottlenecks for key new components for our advanced AI server platforms. Q4 results were driven by our high-growth AI/GPU and rack-scale solutions which represented 52% of our total revenues. We had two 10% customers for Q4 and did not have any 10% customers for fiscal year '23. During Q4, we recorded $976 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 45% of revenues versus 50% last quarter. This was up 19% year-over-year and up 51% quarter-over-quarter as we ramped several key enterprise programs. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $1.17 billion in revenues, representing 53% of Q4 revenues versus 47% last quarter, up 59% year-over-year and up 94% quarter-over-quarter as we gained momentum from existing and new datacenter, CSP, and OEM cloud appliance customers. Our emerging 5G, Telco, Edge, IoT segment achieved $43 million in revenues, representing 2% of Q4 revenues versus 3% last quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, Organic Enterprise and Channel and AI/ML revenues grew 10% to represent 48% of total revenues. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment grew 102% and represented 49% of total revenues. The emerging 5G Telco Edge IOT segment decreased 36% and represented 3% of total revenues. The mix of complete systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has increased over the last two years.  Server and Storage Systems comprised 93% of Q4 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 7%. ASPs continued to increase on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis driven by the value and complexity of our rack-scale Total IT Solutions. By geography, U.S. represented 76% of Q4 revenues, Asia 11%, Europe 10%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 55%. Asia decreased 17%, and Europe increased 1%, and Rest of World increased 12%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 112%, Asia increased 10%, Europe decreased 1%, and Rest of World increased 11%. The Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.1%, down quarter-over-quarter from 17.7% in Q3 as we focused on winning strategic new designs and market share. For fiscal year '23, the non-GAAP gross margin of 18.1% versus 15.4% for fiscal year '22 was driven by an increased rack-scale product/customer mix and higher manufacturing efficiencies. Turning to operating expenses, Q4 Opex on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year to $145 million driven by headcount and related expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 14% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year to $133 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 11% for Q4 versus 8.7% last quarter due to operating leverage driven by higher revenues that outpaced increases in operating expenses. For fiscal year '23, we achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.4% versus 7.2% in fiscal year '23 due to higher gross margins and operating leverage from higher revenues and expense controls. Other Income & Expense for Q4 was an expense of approximately $1.5 million consisting of $3.5 million in interest expense offset primarily by a net foreign-exchange gain of $2.0 million. Our interest expense increased sequentially as we utilized our short-term credit lines for working capital requirements along with higher short-term interest rates on our borrowings.  The tax provision for Q4 was $31.3 million on a GAAP basis and $36.6 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 13.9% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.4%. The GAAP tax rate was 14.7% for fiscal year '23 versus 15.7% in fiscal year '22 and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.9% versus 17.7% in fiscal year '22. We delivered strong Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.51 which exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.21 to $2.71 and the recently updated range of $3.35 to $3.45. The increase in Q4 EPS was due to a combination of higher revenues and operating leverage. For the full fiscal 2023, we reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $11.81, up 109% year-over-year versus fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.65 and higher than the FY'23 guidance of $10.50 to $11.00. Cash flow used in operations for Q4 was $9 million compared to cash flow generated by operations of $198 million in Q3 due to higher accounts receivable, offset by lower inventory and higher accounts payable from backend loaded shipments in the quarter due to supply constraints.  CapEx was $8 million for Q4 resulting in negative free cash flow of $17 million versus positive free cash flow of $190 million last quarter. For fiscal year '23, we had free cash flow from operations of $664 million, CapEx of $37 million resulting in free cash flow of $627 million. We have $50 million remaining under the authorized buyback program which expires on January 31, 2024. The closing balance sheet cash position was $440 million, while bank debt was $290 million resulting in a net cash position of $150 million down from net cash position of $176 million last quarter as we utilized our bank lines of credit to support higher revenues and accounts receivable as we ramped up production of new AI/GPU design wins. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q4 cash conversion cycle improved to 77 days versus 126 days in Q3. Days of Inventory was 75, representing a decrease of 51 days versus the prior quarter of 126 days. Days Sales Outstanding was down 13 days quarter-over-quarter to 38 days while Days Payables Outstanding came down by 15 days to 36 days. Faster inventory turns contributed to the improvement in our cash conversion cycle. Now turning to the outlook, we remain enthusiastic about our diversified business model, covering a wide range of AI, core computing, storage, 5G telco edge and IOT applications. Design wins span across enterprise/channel, large datacenter/emerging AI CSP, and Telco and OEM customers.  We are carefully observing the global macro-economic situation and continuing supply-chain constraints especially for leading AI platforms. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ending September 30, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.02 to $2.80 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.75 to $3.50. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q4 levels.  GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $185 million and include $48 million in stock-based compensation and other expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase due to continued investments in R&D and higher personnel costs adding to our great engineering and sales teams. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $44 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects of $9 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $1.5 million. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 14.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%, and a fully diluted share count of 56 million for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are giving guidance -- I'm sorry, the first fiscal year 2024. Which ends June 30, 2024. We are giving guidance for revenues in the range $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. Okay, Michael, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A. Charles Liang : Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Now we have the first question, comes from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Sir, Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Thank you. And congratulations on an amazing quarter and amazing fiscal year '24 revenue guidance of $9.5 billion. Definitely want to dig into. First off, Charlie, I think he said you have 50% in revenue exposure AI for the June quarter. That's incredible makes a very strong statement that Super Micro, indeed the leader in AI systems. What do you think is a sustainable differentiation that you guys are wielding with rack-scale AI systems that's driving that incredibly fast increase in revenue exposure AI systems? Charles Liang : Yeah, thank you for your question. Yes, as AI has been our major focus is since a few years ago, and we work with AI chip company kind of very closely. And we could develop lots of our platform, including our MTX [ph]. Now coming MTX, as you know, to support a C2and CG1. So our AI solution with rack scale scale, or cloud scale, customer scale solutions that make our customers deploy even much easier. And full rehab, they also solution for energy cost as they've been for time to online. So I believe our AI product line will continuing to grow in the near future maybe continue to be more than 50% of our revenue. Operator : Next question comes from line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question. And Charles, I think it would be very helpful if you could [technical difficulty] $10 billion of revenue. And perhaps any kind of color on ASP increased that would capture your increased content would give us an insight unless you have other ways of explaining to get to $10 billion net. Charles Liang : We continue to get lots of new customer or partner continue to like our solution. And we continue to gain new customer with our rack scale, cloud scale, total solution, including [Indiscernible]. So we see a very strong demand and growing very fast order. So $10 billion should be kind of a short term target this year. Mehdi Hosseini : Last question, your competitors also argue for innovative cooling? And they also argue for shagging? Is there something with your cooling technology that is better offers better cost performance, compared to some of the emerging cooling that your competitors are for marketing, are talking about? Charles Liang : Yeah, indeed, our engineering team is strong and dedicated. Everyone can design systems, our system simply better than others, not just better in quality, performance, but also earlier time to market. And together with service, software, system management. So it's a total solution and service. So we feel pretty confident that we will continue to gain market share. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, maybe move on, because they are becoming more than 50% of your revenue. How is your pipeline as you look into the second half of calendar year? Do you already have a pipeline that gives you confidence, you're going to hit that 50% plus AI as the mix of revenue or you still have to go and qualify and win the business to hit that target. Charles Liang : Indeed, our pipeline I believe is very strong. And that is momentum, its ability is very clear. So we are very confident especially with another chemical customer too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon from Tanwanteng. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong quarter outlook again. My first one, is I just wanted to dig into your confidence for the outlook. Can you just in various parts, maybe talk about your confidence in supply chain, being able to supply that maybe 40% growth guidance at the midpoint? Maybe talk about your ability to get allocations from key suppliers.  And then within your order book and backlog? What is your assurance? Or how can you identify if there's double or triple ordering? And how do you protect yourself against that if they do exist? Charles Liang : Yeah, it's a complicated question. We have a very good product many product line for delta max for redstone max for grace for [indiscernible] and other solutions including error 40s. So the solution is really strong and supply chain we work with our vendor very closely every day. And so hopefully that situation will be consistently improve, but it's not 100% control of our sale. So although we have a good partnership but it's 100% controlled by our sales. So all though we have a good partnership, which vendor, which customer. So we work together very closely, And the situation will be continue to improve I believe Jon Tanwanteng : On the order side Operator : Your next question, I will ready for the next question. David Weigand : John, did you ever follow up question? Jon Tanwanteng : In order site, double protection against double and triple? Charles Liang : Yeah, and see the other side? I mean, the tech order had been continued growing strongly. Every month I see older growth. David Weigand : Also, John, we have a lot of NCNR orders as well. That protects against double and triple booking. Operator : Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital, your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. Yeah, congrats on the strong results and the ongoing momentum. I have a couple if I could. Charles, you've talked in the prepared remarks about the unprecedented demand you're seeing and you guys have talked about actually adding new customers, including top tier data center customers, I think you mentioned and some of these gen AI server forecasts, for 2024 calendar are really, really strong. And you're also talking about gaining share, et cetera.  And so I guess the first question is, is what's the opportunity do you see to maybe even do teach stronger than the fiscal '24 guidance. I guess, what would be the puts and takes there? And, if you were to be able to exceed the 2024 guidance, what would be some of the things you think would need to occur? And then I have a quick follow up. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah, thank you. Very good question. Again, we continue to gain generative AI innovator, and we have a very good partnership. We partnership with some small OEM. And for sure, they need 10 times 20 time more system. And we just cannot ship at this moment, because of supply chain.  And at the same time, we also continue to engage with large CSP, in large data centers. So we continue to gain more customer from I read who say, all given political. So yes, hard to work out which supply chain, three party regime, our supplier, our customer in our sales. And that's have been our major focus now. Although we continue to improve our total datacenter solution included in DRC, direct liquid cooling and liquid immersive solution. So I mean, we are on the right track, yes expecting supply chain can improve so that we can grow our revenue. Ananda Baruah : That's really helpful. And so, Charles, just to make sure that I understood that accurately, is that to say, if the supply chain -- so if you can, if you can get more from the supply chain, actually use it to say this way you have order visibility, such that if you can procure more, you would have the ability to share gains, exceed the fiscal '24 range that you provide is a really supply chain issue, I guess, is what I'm asking. Did I hear that accurately? Charles Liang : Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we continue to prove to our customer and our vendor, say, hey, we have a business solution. So okay with us, that's where we went wherever you went. Ananda Baruah : I got it. And then let me just ask a quick follow up to that one. Is there any way you guys could provide in context for us around I guess how constrained you are, like, what might the demand outlook sort of look like if you were not constrained? So not like a guidance, obviously, you gave your guidance to just content context for us and really getting a sense of what the structural positioning of the company is, if there were not constraints? Charles Liang : Yeah, I can. We have a very good product. And we have a very good partner customer. And we, we pushed our vendor. And we know our vendor doing their best to support us at the same time as well. So we just have to continue to work together. Ananda Baruah : Charles, I have one more quick one, I appreciate it. Sounds like the gross margin guidance for the September quarter is a pretty solid most attractive guide. For fiscal '24, should we assume that same 17% kind of gross margin range or what's the right way to think about that? And that's it for me. Thanks. David Weigand : Sure, Ananda, this is David. So we're targeting to hold our margins. And that's all the guidance that will give right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam [Indiscernible] from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. And also congrats on the results tonight. So I first of all, I just want to clarify, I want to make sure I heard the number. Yeah, the 50% or 52% of the revenue that was from your AI and rack scale solutions as last quarter? David Weigand : Yeah, Adam. Charles, in his script said approximately 50% and I clarified 52%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, so I guess the question isn't either that is that, one of the questions I get asked a lot about, is the spend around AI being so strong. And it sounds like obviously, you're carrying a pretty good backlog looking out over the next several quarters, given the supply dynamics. But if I take that number and I say the non-AI business, how has that trended or basically, are you reallocating capacity away from more of the non or traditional compute side to satisfy demand on the AI side? Or have you seen spending slowdown outside of these AI investments that you're clearly benefiting from? Charles Liang : Yeah, now AI server storage, IoT telco, we keep involve and a bit blend. Understand that industry has been declining, we are not declining, above Fed. And we try to grow as well. And that's why we are growing in many directions kind of manufacturing, kind of like Taiwan and Malaysia. And we may have another North America campus. So that's all to increase our capacity, so that we can grow traditional data center business as well, instead of omni focus on that, growing AI. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So just to be clear, I mean, so you're limiting -- you're limited on your supply, on the traditional compute side, because of the AI demand that you're seeing. Is that fair? Charles Liang : Not exactly impacted, but not exactly. Indeed, as traditional server, traditional datacenter business, and a bit bland from the demand side. So we face into similar experience as well, but not declining to --- Unidentified Analyst : Yep. Okay. And then the final question for me is just thinking about the AI opportunity. And I think you alluded to this a little bit your prepared comments you mentioned positioning around I think it was the Intel, Ivy chip and then also I think another vendor coming to market the MI300 from AMD. How do you see that playing out for your opportunity?  Does it help satisfy the man are you seeing indicators that, this AI opportunity is going to be much more diversified here as we move into '24 versus what you've seen on the NVIDIA side at this point? Just curious how you're seeing kind of the competitive landscape or maybe opportunities that expand for you guys with those newer other solutions coming to market? Charles Liang : Yeah, in retail solutions, [Indiscernible] and people are really waiting for NVIDIA more supply. And other solution from Intel, from AMD, because our box [ph] solution we have a solution ready for show up again. So that's the advantage we have. So we just waiting for their solution to be available in production. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Charles Liang : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon from Tanwanteng. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, thanks for the follow up. Dave, I was wondering if you could talk about your working capital needs in the sort of environment. Can you generate positive cash flow going forward? Are you going to be using cash as you as you try to fulfill this OpEx demand? David Weigand : Yeah, John. We see the business generating good cash flows, as it has historically. And we think that the --- especially in this constrained supply market, where we could deliver more if we had more supply. But we're so really, the constrained supply ends up moderating the working capital. And so we grew our business last quarter quite a bit and grew our ARR. So that utilized a lot of working capital, but we have no concerns about working capital. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. And then could you guys give a little bit more detail on the capacity expansion, and then when those various facilities come online, and what exactly they add? David Weigand : Sure, we have Malaysia, which is expected to come online in around 12 to 15 months. And that's going to --- that will eventually double our capacity. And we also have additional capacity coming online in our building 23, here in our Social Valley campus. And we've also added, as Charles mentioned, another site in in San Jose, with intentions to add another site in the Americas. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it? And then last one, for me. Maybe a more detailed question, what percentage of your AI sales right now are liquid cooling basin? Do you expect that percentage to increase as you go forward? Charles Liang : This is very new questions. So we have a very good DLC, direct liquid cooling solution ready to go now. And it's all depends on customer demand. And at the same time, the big emotions solution also getting ready. So we have all three solution and depends on customer's demand. At this moment, for sure [indiscernible] still a majority, as you know. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. Thanks. Charles. Charles Liang : Thanks. Operator : Your next question from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Yeah, thank you for the follow up question. So NVIDIA was guided their July quarter data center revenue up 2x QonQ. What does that mean for Super Micro in terms of GPU systems? Especially what I'm trying to drive is that is there a lag between when a video that's recognized revenue and when to rest from server OEMs gets revenue recognized revenue? Charles Liang : We believe their capacity are growing. And that's why we talk to them every day asking for more. So hopefully we can gather more support from them. And hopefully their capacity that grows mostly quickly. So that's all I can say now. Okay. Nehal Choski : Okay. You have a -- I guess on, what is your AI-related market share during the June quarter and what they're not that was up QonQ? David Weigand : We don't have --- we're not going to go into offer a market share for the June quarter. You can make some assumptions by looking at the results of others. But, we have we sell different GPUs as Charles mentioned. So, there is a direct correlation. Charles Liang : Yeah, basically we have a strong order backorder. And we still have not full capacity. We are waiting for more AI chip. That's our situation. Nehal Choski : Yep, understood. And how should we think about distributing the remaining 8 million across the final three quarters here? David Weigand : We're not going to announce quarter-by-quarter our guidance. But we're expecting this to be a robust year and has tempered by the natural supply constraints because of the popularity of these new platforms, Charles Liang : Yeah, basically in NVIDIA we have a more capacity for sure. And we're really happy to wait over there. And besides other than the alternates our residental mix next is a company that is already in our CG-1 solution is pretty much ready as well. So we believe we can ship much more and not less situation. So in next four quarter I believe will continue to grow quarter after quarter. Nehal Choski : Thank you very much, Charles Liang : And even a supply condition, I believe we can surpass $10.5 million for sure easily. Operator : Thank you, everyone for joining time for question at this time. And this will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you, everyone.",

At the end of today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce that we are off to a good start for fiscal 2024, with first quarter revenues of $2.12 billion. We navigated tight AI GPU and key components supply conditions to deliver total solutions and large compute clusters, especially for generative AI workloads where our backorders continue to expand faster than our forecast. During the first quarter, demand for our leading AI platforms in plug-and-play rack-scale, especially for the LLM-optimized NVIDIA HGX-H100 solutions, was the primary growth driver. Many customers have started to request direct-attached cold-plate liquid-cooling solutions to address the energy costs, power grid constraints and thermal challenges of these new GPU infrastructures. In some cases, customers are able to double their datacenter AI computing capacity using our DLC solution due to lower system power requirements, lower PUE and higher computing density per cluster. To meet this strong demand, we have been continuously expanding our validation and production facilities. By the coming March quarter, we expect to complete a dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100 kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, that will further expand our total rack production capacity to 5,000 racks per month in full-speed mass production. The increased AI business also includes our new inferencing platforms and telco-optimized edge products based on the L40S, L40 and L4 and for sure H100 as well, AI product lines. Furthermore, the upcoming Grace Hopper Superchip-based MGX products for both generative AI and inferencing AI are just ready for volume production. Our broadest AI solution portfolio also includes Intel Gaudi 2, PCIe Flex, PVC a codename from the backyard [ph], as well as AMD MI250 and MI300X and MI300A based platforms. We fully expect many of these products to gain broad adoption and expand our share in the accelerated compute market. Let\u2019s go over some key financial highlights. Fiscal Q1 net revenue totaled $2.12 billion, up 14% year-on-year and down 3% quarter-on-quarter, towards the high end of our guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion despite the GPU and key component shortages during our traditionally soft September quarter. Fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings of $3.43 per share were in line with $3.42 a year ago and towards the high end of our guidance range of $2.75 to $3.50, demonstrating continued strong operating leverage during a traditional soft quarter. We launched and are delivering end-to-end Liquid-Cooled Data Center Solutions. We foresee up to 20% of our data center deployments will move to liquid-cooling and for the first time, customers can get a complete rack scale liquid-cooling solution from a single source with a maximum lead time of -- with minimum lead time of about two weeks. Super Micro is working hard to fully take the current AI growth opportunity by speeding up the development of more new AI optimized platforms. Super Micro is utilizing its Building Block Architecture to continue our first to market DNA with the launch of NVIDIA CG1, CG2 Grace Hopper Superchip and NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip as we speak. Super Micro\u2019s latest MGX systems provide groundbreaking computing densities, energy efficiency and ease of datacenter deployment and serviceability, ideal for hyperscale and edge data centers. I believe this ongoing AI revolution will impact all industries and the world, possibly much more impactful than the Industrial revolution over 200 years ago. As most people know, the power consumption and thermal challenges of these new AI technologies have risen dramatically. We are now shipping up to 80 kilowatt rack solutions, with 100 kilowatt rack just around the corner, for compute-intensive datacenter, CSP and other industries. Our high power efficiency systems, free-air and liquid-cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. I anticipate that up to 20% or more of global datacenters will transition to liquid-cooled solutions in just a few years. In addition, the combination of increasing computing density, reducing TCO and liquid-cooling reduces the environmental impact of datacenters significantly. This is well-aligned with Super Micro\u2019s green computing mission as we improve datacenter performance-per-watt, per square foot and per dollar. To better support traditional datacenter, enterprise and IoT, telco industry, we have begun the seeding and early ship of the upcoming fifth generation Intel Xeon processor, codenamed Emerald Rapids and shipping fourth generation AMD EPYC processor, codenamed Genoa and Bergamo SP5 and SP6 with more computing cores, PCIe Gen 5, CXL and many other workload-optimized features. For customers that want to test drive these latest systems, we offer our JumpStart program with remote access to our high-end X13, H13 and GPU systems for qualified customer\u2019s workload validation, testing and benchmarking before volume deployments. As the performance of CPU, GPU and memory technologies increase, enhancing storage performance is also necessary to feed massive datasets to the applications without becoming a bottleneck that slows the entire system or cluster down. Super Micro\u2019s new PCIe Gen 5 based E1.S and E3.S Petascale All-Flash storage servers offer industry-leading storage performance and capacity. Together, with our U.2 NVMe, top-loaded system and traditional storage platforms, we are fulfilling customer\u2019s AI, compute and storage needs with one-stop total solution shopping experience. Super Micro\u2019s Total IT Solutions is being recognized as saving customers from the complications of design, validation, sourcing, integration and onsite deployment. We are also streamlining their network switching, firmware and software management challenges, topping it off with our 24x7 Global deployment and service tiers. Essentially, our customers are now incorporating our capabilities into their long-term infrastructure plans, entrusting Super Micro provides them with fully optimized solutions and with scale capacity to fit their long-term needs. Given our current customers infrastructure demands, we have continued to evaluate our footprint beyond our ongoing expansion in Malaysia. We are adding several new buildings close to our Silicon Valley HQ campus and on track to surpass our current capacity of 4000 racks per month. Today, with utilization rate at about 60%, our U.S. headquarter and Taiwan facility can easily support at least $18 billion in revenue. The new Malaysia facility will serve building blocks with high volume scale and improved cost structure, while pushing our total revenue capacity to a much higher scale than $20 billion. We are also continuing to work with some of our key partners and are deep in the planning process of adding a new manufacturing campus in North America, outside of California focused. We have just celebrated our 30th anniversary in September. For the past 30 years, we have been working tirelessly towards gaining industry leadership position with a best-in-class product portfolio, global scale capability and capacity, and the best time to market, distinguishing ourselves from the competition. Our IT industry leadership position will be even stronger in the near future. The pipeline of new products in the coming quarters has never been stronger. We are gaining market momentum that I expect to build deep into 2024, giving me confidence that fiscal Q2 revenue will be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Additionally, we are expecting continued strength for the second half of fiscal year 2024 and now forecast revenue in the range of $10 billion to $11 billion. Our position as a leading supplier of rack-scale plug-and-play Total AI and IT Solutions has just begun. Our growth will accelerate as we deliver more optimized AI infrastructure to existing and emerging markets, along with our growing software and services value. I also look forward to providing more updates on our product lines in the coming quarters that will continue to extend our datacenter technology leadership for years to come. With that in mind, I expect our $20 billion annual revenue target to be just a couple of years away. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our CFO, I want to take this chance to thank to our partners, our customers, our Super Micro employees and our shareholders for your continued support. Thank you. David? David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q1 2024 revenues were $2.12 billion, up 14% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were towards the end of our guidance range -- the upper end of our guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, driven by AI-related platforms despite supply-chain challenges and summer seasonality. Next generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog. We expect diversified growth in fiscal 2024, driven by top-tier datacenters, emerging CSPs, enterprise investments in new AI, CPU servers and edge, IOT, telco markets. We are also enhancing our offerings in Storage, Switches, Software and Services to strengthen our Total Solutions offerings. During Q1, we recorded $917 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 43% of revenues versus 45% last quarter. This was up 10% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally lower enterprise spending as customers focus on AI investments. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical revenues were $1.17 billion, representing 55% of Q1 revenues versus 53% last quarter. This was up 26% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. One existing CSP large datacenter customer represented 25% of total revenues for Q1. Our emerging 5G, telco, edge, IoT segment revenues were $31 million, which represented 2% of Q1 revenues. AI, GPU and rack-scale solutions again represented over 50% of our total revenues this quarter with AI, GPU revenues in both the enterprise channel and the OEM appliance and large data center verticals. The mix of complete systems, storage and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has increased over the last two years. Server and Storage Systems comprised 93% of Q1 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 7%. ASPs increased significantly on a year-over-year basis and decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter driven by product and customer mix. By geography, U.S. represented 76% of Q1 revenues, Asia 11%, Europe 9% and Rest of World 4%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 25%, Asia decreased 17%, Europe decreased 19% and Rest of World increased 63%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 3%, Asia decreased 4%, Europe decreased 16% and Rest of World increased 38%. The Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 17%, down slightly quarter-over-quarter from 17.1%. We continue to focus on winning strategic new designs and gaining market share. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 25% quarter-over-quarter and 42% year-over-year to $181 million driven by higher stock-based compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter and increased 11% year-over-year to $130 million. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 10.8% versus 11% last quarter and 12.5% a year ago due to changes in revenues, gross margins and operating expenses. Other income and expense for Q1 was approximately $4.7 million, consisting of $1.9 million in interest expense offset by a net gain of $6.6 million principally from foreign exchange. Our interest expense decreased sequentially as we paid down our debt during the quarter. The income -- the tax provision for Q1 was $20.2 million on a GAAP basis and $36.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 11.4% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.5%. We delivered strong Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.43, which was at the high end of the guidance range of $2.75 to $3.50 due to revenues towards the higher end of guidance, stable gross margins, lower non-GAAP OpEx and foreign exchange gains. Cash flow generated from operations for Q1 was $271 million, compared to cash flow used in operations of $9 million during the previous quarter due to continued strong profitability offset by higher inventory requirements based on build plans for Q2. CapEx was $3 million for Q1 resulting in positive free cash flow of $268 million versus negative free cash flow of $17 million last quarter. We have $50 million remaining under the authorized buyback program which expires on January 31, 2024. The closing balance sheet cash position was $543 million, while bank debt was $146 million resulting in a net cash position of $397 million, up from a net cash position of $150 million last quarter. We generated $271 million in operating cash flow and paid down debt by $144 million in Q1. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q1 cash conversion cycle was 86 days versus 77 days in Q4. Days of inventory increased by 16 days to 91 days versus the prior quarter of 75 days as we built inventory for a seasonally strong Q2. Days sales outstanding was up by five days quarter-over-quarter to 43 days, while days payables outstanding increased by 12 days to 48 days. Now turning to the outlook, we remain enthusiastic about our diversified business model covering a wide range of GPU, AI, core computing, storage, 5G telco, edge and IOT solutions. We expect a seasonally strong Q2 and are carefully observing the global macro-economic situation and continuing supply-chain constraints especially for leading AI platforms. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ending December 31, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $3.75 to $4.24 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.40 to $4.88. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q1 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $191 million and include $49 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $40 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $13 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company\u2019s projections for Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.1% and a fully diluted share count of 57.6 million for GAAP and 58.3 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million and a range of $105 million to $115 million for the fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion to $10 billion to $11 billion. Michael, we are now ready for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey. Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong and ongoing execution. I guess, yeah, just so a couple of the starts. Charles, can you talk about the degree to which you guys either are benefiting or anticipate the benefit from the increased NVIDIA supply that was pointed to China but now needs to find other places to go? And to the degree you think you might benefit, if you could give us some sense of at what rate that benefit makes its way out of China and into other countries. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Charles Liang : Thank you for the question. Again, it\u2019s a complicated situation. But at this moment, we believe December quarter, our supply from NVIDIA will be much better than last quarter. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are able to fulfill more percentage of customer demand and that\u2019s why we say, $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion should be our target. So basically, a price condition that we need to meet. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s actually really helpful context. I appreciate it. And then, I guess, sort of dovetailing from that, Charles. So the midpoint of the implied guide for the fiscal year, the raised guide, $10.5 billion, implies that the March quarter and June quarter would also be about $2.8 billion, which is the midpoint of your December quarter guide. And then you also, though, made mention of growth accelerating. And so -- and that -- and it seems like supply is getting better. You also have co-op capacity coming on, going into the year. So I guess the question is, is there conservatism built in into even the implied fiscal year guide that\u2019s been raised or is there some pull-forward in December quarter that you think might be challenging to duplicate in the March and June quarter? It seems like conservatism, but just wanted to check that? Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah. Thank you. Again, we continue to gain lots of design win. So our back order has been growing faster than what we forecast in reality. So at this moment, $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for December should be a very conservative number. And for our whole fiscal year, $10 billion to $11 billion, again, should be a conservative number. So I feel very optimistic to continue to grow quickly and that\u2019s why we continue to grow our rack-scale, including a difficulty rack-scale rather than production capacity. Likewise, just, before we have 4,000 rack per month capacity and now pretty much we will grow to 5,000 rack per month capacity very soon. So we are very optimistic for the future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from George Wang with Barclays. Your line is open. George Wang : Oh! Hey, guys. Hey, Charles. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe you could give some color in terms of the allocation from other suppliers and partners, kind of maybe in the near-term, kind of for the future, like the AMD MI300, which is expected to launch in the first quarter 2024. And also aside from H100 from NVIDIA, any other upside when the L40S from NVIDIA is ramping? Just curious and also including Gaudi from Intel. Maybe you can give some color on allocation from additional suppliers? Charles Liang : Yeah. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean, as you know, we have a very strong NVIDIA product line, including the L40S, right, and including the CG1, CG2 on the way. And AMD MI300X also getting ready. And Intel Gaudi 2 is ready to volume production. So although we have a very good demand and very strong supply capacity. So, again, I feel very optimistic for a quicker growth. George Wang : Okay. Thanks. I have a quick follow up if I can. Just in terms of when Malaysia coming out and also in the future, kind of Taiwan facility, any thoughts on the kind of impact to the profit margin and kind of obviously with the much lower labor costs, can you kind of quantify, maybe give some color just on expected operating margin accretion going forward? Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, as of what I just shared, our utilization rate for U.S. and Taiwan capacity today only about 60%. So when we have a higher utilization rate, our overall cost will be lower, right? So that\u2019s why when we grow revenue, our profitability will increase. And Malaysia, as you know, is a lower cost campus. So once we start production in Malaysia, our cost will be better and profit margin will be slightly improved. Operator : Our next question comes from Janik Wing with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. It\u2019s actually Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks for taking my question. David, your midpoint of the December quarter guide implies 57% year-over-year growth, but operating margin declining by about 100-basis-point. I understand utilization rate is in the 60% range, but as you bring up utilization rate, how should I think about the OpEx and the leverage from here on? David Weigand : Yeah. So we expect that we will continue to get operating leverage, Mehdi. We were, I think, a little conservative in our guide for OpEx in Q2. So we -- and as we were in Q1, and so we came in a little bit lower. We are doing everything we can to do that in Q2 as well. So back to your operating guide question. We came down a little bit on gross margin year-over-year, as you know, but we expect -- as Charles mentioned, we expect some gross margin leverage, as well as operating margin leverage as we -- as our operating expenses never increase at the rate that our revenues are. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. And Charles, a big part of your cause is memory and other components. And everything we have heard from memory manufacturers that they are not going to sell at prices that were prevalent just a couple of months ago. So memory prices are going up. And how do you alleviate that inflationary trend to be able to expand margins? Charles Liang : Thank you. I mean, basically we are able to pass-through our cost to customers. So for that portion, basically we are kind of okay. We won\u2019t be impacted by that. At least it won\u2019t be impacted too much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys, and great quarter and a nice outlook. Just wanted a little more color on the gross margin guidance and outlook. I mean, I assume you are getting better margins and utilization and on your new facilities on the ramp. Are you simply planning to give all that back with the share gain initiatives and the hyperscale mix or is there some input cost component and kind of when should we expect the timeframe for gross margin leverage to really become apparent? Is it only with the new facilities or can that happen a little sooner than that? David Weigand : Well, it\u2019s a combination, Jon, of -- as we ramp revenues up, we are going to get leverage on the gross margin because, as Charles mentioned earlier, we are going to get higher efficiency and factory throughput as we -- which will lower costs as we put more through the factories. So we will get some benefit there. We will also get benefit as we transition more manufacturing over to Malaysia and Taiwan. And I think that -- so that\u2019s why right now we are, although, very competitive situation, we are maintaining our margin guidance for Q2. Charles Liang : Yeah. I can add a little bit of some color. I mean, kind of our software business is growing. Our service, including on-site deployment, all those will help our gross margin, our value bridge. So at this moment, we should be on the right track, healthy direction. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the, I think you said, you are building seven new buildings here in the U.S. I know you are expanding and looking for places to put facilities in North America. Would those all be margin accretive or neutral or negative, just given the higher costs here? How do we think about those facilities and their impact? Charles Liang : Oh! Very good question. Indeed, we are adding some more buildings in the Bay Area and most of those will be rental buildings, because our growth is faster than what we can build in a building. So it will be a rental facility. And then I did mention about we are looking for another location, hopefully in a little bit of a lower cost state in North America. So we are planning for building a new campus in -- we will decide in the next few months, I believe. But short-term, new buildings in Silicon Valley will be rental property. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Choski, Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski : Yeah. Thank you. You may have already addressed this, but what are your expectations for AI revenue contribution with respect to the midpoint of December quarter guide being up 32% quarter-over-quarter? David Weigand : Yeah. So I think we are expecting really the same performance, Nehal. We will expect it to be in a range of over 50%. Nehal Choski : Okay. And can you give a little bit more precise number as far as what the exposure was in the September quarter other than greater than 50%? David Weigand : That\u2019s -- we are giving that approximate figure and that\u2019s our guide. Charles Liang : Yeah. Basically AI revenue percentage continues to grow, but hopefully in ALCN [ph] consistently with\u2026 Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and also congrats on the quarter. I am just curious, going back to the supply side of the discussion, how would you, as you are engaging with customers and thinking about their build-out plans in their datacenter footprints for AI, how would you characterize the evolution of lead times on these higher end GPUs? I mean, relative to what it was maybe 90 days ago, how has that evolved and how are you seeing that evolve into the current quarter? Charles Liang : Yes. It\u2019s a complicated job. However, because our building-box solution and our global footprint together, we have a huge lead time. We support hundreds of customers. So [Technical Difficulty] indeed, relatively, we are able to take care of the allocation, the lead time, the inventory control, product flow-in, more efficient than our competitors. And we are continually improving in that area. Aaron Rakers : So, you would say that lead times have improved throughout this course this last quarter and you would expect that, it sounds like to continue improving in the December quarter. It\u2019s kind of a fair characterization. Charles Liang : Yes. And that\u2019s why our inventory utilization rate will be improving. So, before, I guess, we have about 90 days turnaround time. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Charles Liang : And I guess that will be improved when the scale continues to grow and when we continue to\u2026 Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Charles Liang : \u2026 leverage our building-box solution, situation will continue to improve. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. And then the follow-up question would be, as the market evolves more competitively and you see, I know a prior question on the MI300, you have got the Gaudi Silicon. I guess the way I think about it is these customer deployments are longer cycle. It\u2019s not like these decisions are made in a given quarter. So, as we look to these products, particularly the MI300X ramping, really starting early part of next year and through the course of next year. Are those projects that you are already seeing visibility into and that actually adds another layer of growth to the pipeline? Are those projects that you have already been designed in and you are just waiting for those products to kind of launch to really start to see that incremental revenue for those competitive offerings? Charles Liang : Yeah. You are right. Because our building-box solution, so we are able to design all that and make a new technology available earlier than the market, basically. So, usually we send our solution to customer for evaluation so our customer can make a decision earlier and that allows Super Micro, there will be an earlier time to prepare the product, prepare inventory. So, it doesn\u2019t matter if we have a solution, AMD solution or Intel solution, we provide a same building-box solution and we gain time to market advantage. We provide a customer earlier seeding, earlier system so that they can validate in advance. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session and our conference call today.

At the end of today\u2019s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael and good afternoon everyone. I'm delighted to share our second quarter results, which show a record-breaking performance for Super Micro. We achieved revenue of $3.66 billion, a 133% increase from last year, and earnings per share of $5.59. This is our first quarter ever with over $3 billion revenue. More importantly, this single quarter's revenue surpassed our annual revenue for 2021. This fantastic quarterly result was driven by strong demand and improving supply conditions for GPU and related key system components. Our rack-scale plug-and-play IT and AI Total Solution continues to gain more new customers, along with their confidence in Super Micro as their go-to infrastructure partner. Our AI rack-scale solutions, especially the Deep-Learning and LLM-optimized based on NVIDIA HGX-H100, continue gaining high popularity. The demand for AI inferencing systems and mainstream compute solutions has also started to grow. The exciting news is that, finally, we are entering an accelerating demand phase now from many more customer wins. To support faster growth, we have increased our working capital recently by raising about $600 million with an equity offering. Moreover, we have other programs to increase our cashflow without additional equity dilution to support short and long-term sustainable growth. Overall, I feel very confident that this AI boom will continue for another many quarters, if not many years. And together with the related inferencing and other computing eco system requirements, demand can last for even many decades to come, we may call this an AI revolution. Let\u2019s go over some key financial highlights. First, fiscal Q2 net revenue totaled $3.66 billion, up 103% year-on-year and up 73% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding the top end of our original guidance of $2.9 billion for December quarter. Second. Fiscal Q2 non-GAAP earnings of $5.59 per share were well above $3.26 a year ago and exceeded the guidance range of $4.40 to $4.88, further demonstrating continued strong operating leverage. Economy of scale is important to us for continue strong growth. Supermicro is at the forefront of the AI revolution, where the pace of innovation is accelerating. We are leading the race by developing the most innovative AI infrastructure on many platforms at rack scale, for almost any industry, and for any market vertical. As the market leader, we have been preparing to more than double the size of our current AI portfolio with the coming soon NVIDIA CG1, CG2 Grace Hopper Superchip, H200 and B100 CPUs -- GPUs, L40S Inferencing-optimized GPUs, AMD MI300X/MI300A, and Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. All these new platforms will be ready for high volume production in the coming month and quarters. Moreover, we are adding further optimized new architectures for the upcoming NVIDIA GPU product lines. Our AMD MI300X systems are sampling now, and our Intel Gaudi 3 system is coming soon. More importantly, we are continuing to invest and innovate in datacenter and enterprise liquid-cooling technology to make sure these high-power AI platforms are in line with our green computing methodology, while improving the performance, efficiency, and reliability of systems in a datacenter. As a Total IT Solutions innovator, manufacturer and provider, more and more of the major deployments is being delivered as an integrated rack solution, particularly for the AI cluster deployments. Servers, networking, storage, security features, and software are optimized, validated, delivered, and serviced as an integrated rack cluster from Supermicro\u2019s manufacturing facilities worldwide. Leveraging our building block architecture and operation/production automation systems, we can deliver optimized rack solutions with time-to-market and quality advantages for our customers more efficiently than competition. Our TTD, Time-to-Delivery factor has been in a continuous improvement. By this June quarter, we will have high volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100 kilowatt to 120 kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity up to 1,500 racks per month and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then. At the same time, our volume -- high volume clean room rack-scale production facility will be ready to service critical customers very soon. The rapid growth of our business is driving the need for additional R&D, solution optimization, manufacturing and service capacity. Today, our production utilization rate is about 65% across our USA, Netherlands and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling. To address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley headquarter, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while other new facility will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion. To summarize, our record quarterly performance demonstrates our Building Block rack scale plug-and-play IT and AI industry leadership, which continues to accelerate and shows signs of strong market share gains. The continued strength of existing customer builds and ramp of newly acquired customers, and the robust pipeline of new products coming in 2024 gives me confidence that fiscal Q3 revenue will be in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion. Additionally, we are expecting continued strength for the second half of fiscal 2024, and now forecast revenue for the full fiscal year ending in June to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. We are in overdrive to accelerate Supermicro 3.0 business model with this AI boom. At the meantime, we are preparing ourselves for the next phase of Supermicro business growth with Supermicro 4.0 and its expanding TAM. Now is certainly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank again to our partners, our customers, our Supermicro employees and our shareholders for your strong support. Now, let me pass to our CFO David, for more financial details. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q2 2024 revenues were $3.66 billion, up 103% year-over-year and up 73% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were higher than our initial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion and slightly above our recently updated guidance of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion. Our growth was driven by demand from new and existing customers for our leading AI and rack-scale Total IT solutions and an improving supply chain. Next generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog from top-tier data centers, emerging cloud service providers, enterprise/channel, and edge/IoT/telco customers. During Q2, we recorded $1.48 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 40% of revenues versus 43% last quarter, up -- this was up 55% year-over-year and up 62% quarter-over-quarter, driven by enterprise AI and CPU upgrade programs. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $2.15 billion, representing 59% of Q1 revenues versus 55% last quarter, up 175% year-over-year and up 83% quarter-over-quarter. Two existing CSP/large data center customers represented 26% and 11% of total revenues for Q2. Emerging 5G, Telco, Edge, IoT revenues were $35 million or 1% of Q2 revenues. Growth was driven by AI/GPU and rack-scale total IT solutions, which again represented over 50% of total revenues this quarter with AI/GPU revenues in both the enterprise/channel and the OEM appliance/large data center verticals. Server and Storage Systems comprised 94% of Q2 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 6%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by product and customer mix. By geography, the US represented 71% of Q2 revenues, Asia 18%, Europe 8%, and rest of the world 3%. On a year-over-year basis, US revenues increased 139%, Asia increased 98%, Europe decreased 8%, and rest of the world increased 67%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, US revenues increased 61%, Asia increased 191%, Europe increased 51%, and rest of the world increased 37%. The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.5%, which was down quarter-over-quarter from 17% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs and gaining market share. Turning to operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 6% quarter-over-quarter and 58% year-over-year to $193 million, driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 18% quarter-over-quarter and 41% year-over-year to $153 million. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3% versus 10.8% last quarter as we benefited from operating leverage driven by higher revenues. Other Income and Expense for Q2 was a net expense of approximately $16 million, consisting of $8 million in interest expense and a loss of $8 million principally from foreign exchange. Interest expense increased sequentially as we drew down on short-term bank credit facilities for working capital during the quarter. The tax provision for Q2 was $61.5 million on a GAAP basis and $71.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 17.3% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 17.8%. Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.59 exceeded the high end of our initial guidance of $4.40 to $4.88 and slightly above our recently updated guidance of $5.40 to $5.55 due to operating leverage. Cash flow used in operations for Q2 was $595 million compared to cash flow generated by operations of $271 million during the previous quarter. Strong profitability and higher level of accounts payable was offset by higher inventory and accounts receivable due to build plans for Q3 and the timing of shipments during Q2. CapEx was $15 million for Q2 resulting in negative free cash flow of $610 million versus positive free cash flow of $268 million last Quarter. During the quarter, we executed an equity offering and raised approximately $583 million in net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other issuance costs from the sale of 2.3 million shares at a price of $262 per share. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet cash position was $726 million, while bank debt was $376 million resulting in a net cash position of $350 million versus a net cash position of $397 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q2 cash conversion cycle was 61 days versus 86 days in Q1. Days of Inventory decreased by 24 days to 67 days versus the prior quarter of 91 days due to the timing of shipments during the quarter. Days sales outstanding was down by 14 days quarter-over-quarter to 29 days while days payables outstanding decreased by 13 days to 35 days. Now, turning to the outlook, we expect a strong March quarter as we continue to gain momentum with new and existing customers for our AI and rack-scale total IT solutions. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ending March 31, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.79 to $5.64 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $5.20 to $6.01. We expect gross margins to be slightly lower than Q2 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $201 million and include $39 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2024 diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $28 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $14 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $9 million. The company's projections for Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 13.8%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.8%, and a fully diluted share count of 60.1 million for GAAP and 61.0 million for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q3 to be in the range of $18 million to $21 million and a range of $105 million to $115 million for the fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $10 billion to $11 billion to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. Michael, we're now ready for Q& A Operator : [Operator Instructions]. It's also been asked to keep yourself to one question with one follow-up question. We'll pause here briefly as questions are registered. Our first question is from George Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open. George Wang : Hey guys, congrats on the quarter on a strong guide. I have two questions. Firstly, can you kind of supply versus demand, obviously for the December quarter probably driven by both including supply and also strong demand. So, if you can maybe you can talk about backlog level and also on the supply side, are they still ongoing constraints right now? Charles Liang : Yeah, thank you for the question. Indeed, the demand is still stronger than supply. So, we have a more supply, we would be able to ship more and we are very happy to continue and grow our capacity, work out betas, even higher support so to grow business even quicker. George Wang : Okay, thank you. And quickly a follow-up just on the liquid cooling. You talked about kind of expanding to 1,500 racks per month after June this year, and maybe you can talk about your expectation for the total production mix from liquid-cooled racks by year-end, and also maybe you can parse out kind of difference, the configure within the liquid cooling. I know you guys have some immersion cooling and air to liquid cooling. So maybe you can double-click on this thematic topic going forward. Charles Liang : Yeah. Thank you George for the question. In the liquid cooling, we are beating the industry. So, we have a huge capacity ready and have very mature total solution ready, but lots of customer, already rack liquid cooling by their data center, needed some more time to be to ready. I mean their infrastructure needed some more time. So, we believe -- I think liquid cooling will be the trend and we continue to make ourselves ready and try our best to support the customer, including providing some help to their data center infrastructure. So, I believe liquid cooling percentage will continue to grow, but at this moment most of the shipping is still air cooled. George Wang : Okay great, thank you. I'll go back to the queue. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results here. Maybe, if I can just start with the gross margin. You did have a step-down here in 2Q, you're guiding to a slight moderation in 3Q. Maybe just help me understand, as a management team, how do you think about balancing the opportunities that you've going forward in terms of market-share wins and design-wins relative to sort of big growing profitably over the long-run, how you sort of evaluating those opportunities side-by-side and then I have a follow-up. Thank you. David Weigand : Sure, thanks, Samik. So, when we win a new customer, we always try to go in and out. And so we go into the organization and try to spread out into the different divisions. And so, in order to do that as we take on new customers, we do evaluate and try to win the business, which requires us to be competitive. And so, we always are balancing in the interest of shareholder value, how to maximize that. And so, at this time we are we are growing really quickly. And in order to do that and in order to take market share, we will take opportunities by being more competitive on pricing. Charles Liang : The good thing is that when we continue to grow our economies of scale, our operation margin indeed will be still able to keep in healthy position. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And then just this more near-term question when I look at the revenue guide for 3Q and 4Q. Is a step-up here in revenue of about sort of call it $0.5 billion a bit less going from 2Q to 3Q. And then a bigger step-up to get to the mid-point to be annual guide into 4Q, how much of that is driven by just being a bit more cautious about when supply comes in and pushing that the revenue guide a bit more to the 4Q or is that really what the visibility currently of supply of just trying to get sort of what's driving the cadence from 2Q to 3Q to 4Q. And the guide that you provided. Thank you. David Weigand : Yeah, so Samik, we have a very large and growing backlog, which grew again this quarter. And so really as Charles mentioned earlier, our only constraint is supply. However, the good news is, supply is improving. And so to your point, we have to be somewhat conservative, because we are constrained still by supply. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah, thanks. Great impressive guidance and thanks for explanation regarding the dynamic on the forward guidance for both March quarter, plus the June Q guide. Looking at the incremental revenue for the December quarter. Dave, you already alluded to this, you're making shareholder accretive decision. So, that's what's driving the tick down in the gross margin, yet, your operating margin has improved, Q-over-Q. So just to be clear, when you're talking about making shareholder accretive decision, it's still with respect to current revenue not just simply looking at future free cash flows associated with future revenue follow-on from these lower-margin opportunities, is that correct? David Weigand : It's really about trying to return the most shareholder value. So back to your point, we know that with -- because of our tight control over operating expenses, if we get more volume from a large customer, we're going to be able to bring more EPS to our shareholders. So that's really the -- it's really the decision to partner with a really good customer. Nehal Chokshi : Got it. Okay. And then did you review the 10% revenue customers for the quarter? David Weigand : We did, where we said we had two, one 25 and one 11, both in the CSP large data center vertical. Nehal Chokshi : Great, thank you for taking my question. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. And really, congratulations on the fantastic growth. Charles, my first question is for you. I was wondering what gives you the confidence in the growth beyond this year. You mentioned -- inferenced the ecosystem potentially years and decades of demand. Where is the visibility to coming from, what are you seeing in your backlog and your order books and in conversations with customers that gives you that confidence? Charles Liang : Yeah, thank you for the question. Yes, I mean, other than generative deep learning segment continue to grow very strong. Our inferencing opportunity in general CPU customer base also growing. So with AI continuing to be more popular, indeed, so many vertical around the world need more inferencing solutions as well, including private cloud, private kind of data center and [indiscernible]. So, we are approaching continue to grow in [indiscernible] of direction and we see positive feedback, a convincing feedback. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it, and to ask one of the questions that's been mentioned in a different way, is there a gross margin floor as you pursue this share gain. And when do you see a possible inflection? I'm just wondering what is the limit. When you go in terms of gaining share versus the margin that you generate? David Weigand : Sure, so we set out a target back in March of 2021 of 14% to 17%. But that's and we've actually done pretty well against that target. But one thing I'll say is that we have a lot of -- there's a lot of initiatives that play into our favor. Number one, we're doing a lot in terms of expansion to lower our cost envelope. Number two, we are -- our advantage is our building block solutions and what that means is, we're the fastest to market because of the way that we have architected our products. So what that means is there's a lot of new technologies that are coming out from many different technology providers. And we expect to again, as we work with AI, be first-to-market with those. And that first-to-market advantage helps us -- helps to differentiate ourselves as we come out with a complete set of solutions. So, we think that's another thing that will that is always going to play to Super Micro's advantage. Charles Liang : Yeah, especially we have so broad building block proud solution. So, economical scale will help our building block solution to be more efficient because there's lot of product in our volume were still in the middle size to small size volume and we [indiscernible] and will continue to be aggressive to grow to see every segment, every vertical, we have ALC, economies of scale. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay great, thank you. I will turn back in the queue. Operator : Our next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open. Quinn Bolton : Thanks for taking my question. I mean congratulations on the very strong results. I guess I wanted to ask a gross margin question too, obviously it's moderated here in the current quarter and the forward quarter. As you guys position yourself to further market-share gains. I guess my question is, what sort of the midpoint of that 14% to 17% level that you set back in 2021, is that sort of the right level to be thinking about as you guys stay aggressive and try to drive market-share gains? And maybe -- sorry about the twist in the question, to the extent that. Supply catches up to demand and growth rates slow, would you then start to focus more perhaps on higher-margin business, just any sort of thoughts, wherein that 14% to 17% range margin may trend over the next year or two would be helpful? David Weigand : Yeah, for sure I'll -- most important principle is why would a base go for shareholder for our company. So, although we said of 14% to 17% as in that range in 2021, but if any change, any further adjustments would be the pace of a shareholder. We went to that change. And we are carefully evaluating that range kind of monthly. Quinn Bolton : Okay, got it and then as Charles said, question on liquid cooling. Just as you look forward, you guys are ready, it sounds like the infrastructure may still need some improvements, but I guess as you look at data center customers CSPs that are looking to deploy liquid cooling. Is that sort of does that include current-generation sort of 700-watt, GPUs are, is it really the next generation, the B100s and sort of the 1,000 watt GPU class that really drives the adoption at your CSP customers, drives that need for liquid cooling. Charles Liang : You are right. In these current 600 watt, 700, watt module, people can still take care very well, we say air conditioning. And that's why people still are comfortable with our traditional air cooler. But when that system grows to 1,000 or even 1,000 watt per module, yes. I mean -- I think cooling becomes even much more critical. So, by that time, I believe. Most of the data center will have facility ready for that. So we are very optimistic and very patient to continue to improve our quality, especially that reliability and easy for maintenance. So when customers are ready, we can dwell quickly to support them. Quinn Bolton : Excellent. Thank you. David Weigand : Thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the questions and also great results. Just curious, when you talk about your customer concentration and the diversity of the business, when you talk about 26% and 11% of your revenue coming from two customers, are those the same customers, like last quarter I think you had a customer that was 25%, or are you seeing these customers kind of bounce around. I guess the simple question is just, is that the same customer 26% and 25%? David Weigand : So, Aaron. The 26% customer is the same customer. But the 11% customer is not a new customer, and it's a longer-term customer. But first time in 11% and to your point, yes, we do see a bouncing in and out, and we're very happy. Anytime they do bounce about by the way. Charles Liang : Yeah, and that's why the economies of scale is very important to us when we further grow our total revenue, we will have a more large scale customer and more middle-sized and small-sized customers as well. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, and then as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious as we look at the AI kind of evolution from here. There's a lot more kind of product diversity itself coming out, B100s, GH-200s. AMD's product lineup. As you think about the growth going forward, would you say that the growth is more ASP expansion driven, as we think about these next-generation platforms for this diversity driving more of the growth being driven by unit volume growth? I'm just curious on how you would kind of characterize the growth driver from here going forward on those two Inputs. David Weigand : I guess in the next few years, our growth will be quicker in terms of unit number. So that volume growth will be quicker than ASP, because last two years, our ASP have been growing a lot, right. So, in next day, but I guess unit number, volume will grow faster. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah, good afternoon guys. And thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Congrats on the really solid execution. Yeah, congrats on that. I guess, two if I could, Charles. And maybe a clarification, I did some math on the 15,000 racks per month. And they came up with -- I guess $5.6 billion a quarter, let's call it 5.5%. I guess, plus or minus but that came to $5.6 billion, is that kind of accurate and I guess the question is -- if it stood at midyear, you're talking about getting to that point. Is that the kind of run-rate opportunity that we can be thinking about quarterly and not like a guidance, but like an opportunity when you get into sort of the back half of the calendar year. Just wanted to make sure that we're interpreting that kind of accurately and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah, again, we see, we recommend green computing everywhere. That's why wherever, whenever we can help a customer at base, we will. That's why we have been building really large-scale capacity for liquid cooling and other green computing solutions. So yes, that capacity will be huge, but its capacity there, when customer need, we are ready. And indeed our facility also very flexible. Lots of facility can support liquid cooling and air cooler, or combination cooling. So yes, we have a huge capacity ready for growth, but not necessarily all for liquid cooling, they support air cooler or combination hybrid cooling as well. Ananda Baruah : Awesome. Thanks for that. And then could you just, I guess the follow-up is, you guys have mentioned a couple of times on the call today, sort new customers as part of -- and I think Charles, your words were accelerated growth. And so any complexion, I guess any -- sort of any context on the new customers that you guys are wrapping into run-rate kind of would be useful. Anything about them, like what kind of industries, I guess like sort of industries, projects, anything like that would be helpful. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah, thank you, I mean, we spend a lot of effort to make our sales and operational process, service process be automatic. So, those automation systems for sales, for production, for support, really enlarge our capacity. And that's why we have capacity to approach to support a more customer now. So -- and we need economies of scale, because economies of scale is very important to our operation margin and overall EPS. So, yes, we are ready to grow much quicker EBIT. Ananda Baruah : Yeah, that's super helpful. Okay guys, thanks a lot. Congratulations. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, thank you for the follow-up. I was just wondering if there is any change to your OpEx growth formula. It's been on a trailing basis, less than half of our revenue growth is as you grow bigger and do you expect to run against any limit in supporting such a large customer base and potential customer base or are you getting more economies of scale as you grow larger with that? Charles Liang : Yeah, indeed we had been some low-volume company for too long, a 30 years old company. So our volumes just started to grow in kind of good economical scale just recently. And we like to take this chance to continue and grow our economies of scale. So when our economies of scale grow, we leverage automation system again for sales, for operation, and for service. And that's why, I mean, we are in good position to continue growing quickly. Jon Tanwanteng : Okay, great. And then I was just wondering at the rate of growth that you're seeing, do you expect to need more external financing? I know you talked about other sources of cash, I was wondering, if you are going into the debt markets, what the plans are to finance this growth. Charles Liang : Yeah, our financial team have been very diligently working now more source, especially try to minimize dilute the stock equity. So we have a [indiscernible] program kind of we're steady and ready there. So when we need more capital, we are ready. David, you may add something. David Weigand : Yeah, so I'll just echo what Charles said, we're looking at a number of different things, Jon, and we -- but we are mindful of not having further dilution, as Charles said. So, we're -- but we're looking at a number of different opportunities. And the reason we have to is because we need more working capital for growth. And the reason that our cash flows were not -- did not -- were not as strong as last quarter was simply because we grew by so much. So if you -- when you grow by over $1 billion dollars in quarter, you've got to have additional working capital. So that's the plain and simple fact. Charles Liang : Our inventory had been growing more than $1 billion. David Weigand : Yes. Charles Liang : And we are continuing to grow. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it, thank you very much. Operator : Our last question will be from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah, great, thanks for the follow-up question. And I actually have two follow-up questions. First, at the September quarter earnings call I think you guys said the capacity was around $18 billion, that's up from $15 billion to June 2023 quarter. What's the driver of that actually increased capacity or increased ASPs. And then, in relation to that, your full-year guidance that implies a June Q guidance of around $4.7 billion, that implies that your annualized capacity is reaching $19 billion. And so as your capacity is increasing. Is this largely a mix-driven like-for-like ASP driven or how has your capacity actually gone up prior to Malaysia coming online? Charles Liang : Yeah. I mean our ASP gradually continued to grow while that unit number will grow much faster from now on now I guess. So that's why we need more capacity. David Weigand : And one thing I'll add Nehal is that in December, we shipped over $1.7 billion -- $1.8 billion. And so that alone establishes a $19 billion capability. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then my other question is that typically going into the March quarter revenue is seasonally down Q-o-Q, guiding to be up Q-o-Q. Usually when the revenue is down seasonally quarter-on-quarter, your cash conversion cycle goes on a Q-o-Q basis, this March quarter because you're projecting a Q-o-Q revenue increase, does that change your expectations on cash conversion cycle seasonality dynamics? Charles Liang : Well. Yeah, because of the demand, it is very strong. So we believe this March quarter will be a strong quarter as well. David, is there anything to add to that? David Weigand : Yeah, so it really comes down, Nehal to timing. When we receive inventory and when we ship out, so as I mentioned in the December quarter, you can have big activity even within a month, within the quarter, and so that will affect your metrics. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, I'm talking about the December quarter, your cash conversion cycle was actually a lot better than what we had expected. And yes, I recognize there consumption of cash, but it was at least a lot better than what we had expected. Was that actually better than what you had expected given the significant revenue upside that you had delivered here. David Weigand : It absolutely was, yeah. Yeah, we had some that some customer prepayments and things which helped us out. Charles Liang : Yeah, also when economies of scale [Multiple Speakers] grow, we can more efficiently leverage our inventory as well. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Congrats guys. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect your line.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Fiscal Q3 2024 Results on April 30, 2024. With us today are Charles Liang, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Michael Staiger : Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Investor -- excuse me, under the Events & Presentations tab. We have published management's scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, and other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the full fiscal year 2024. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal '23, and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter, with revenue of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up more than 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug-and-play total AI solutions. We continue to face some supply chain challenges due to new products that require new key components, especially, DLC-related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operation, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them. To support this scale-up, we raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short- and long-term growth with minimal equity dilution. Overall, I remain optimistic that AI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years to come. We have long recognized that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, and we have invested heavily into high quality, optimized direct liquid cooling, DLC, solutions for high-end CSPs and NCPs. With GPUs reaching 700 watts and soon more than 1,000 watts, efficiently managing the heat from these AI systems has become critical for many customers, especially at the new data centers. I am pleased to announce that our new DLC liquid cooling building blocks and rack scale total solution technology are finally ready for high volume production. With our DLC liquid cooling technology, customers can reduce their expense on cooling [expense] (ph), saving data center space, and allocate a greater portion of their finite power resources to computing instead of cooling, which aligns with our green computing DNA. Now, let's go over some key financial highlights. Supermicro is pleased to be included in the prestigious S&P 500 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $3.85 billion, up 200% year-on-year, within our aggressive original guidance of March quarter. If not limited by some key component shortages, we could have delivered more. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $6.65 per share were well above $1.63 last year, which was above 308% year-on-year growth. Our increasing economies of scale contributed to better net profit. Our year-over-year operating margin and net income both continue to improve, and we continue to expect further benefits as we bring our Malaysia facility online later in this calendar year. This fast-growing quarter was driven by end users wanting to accelerate their deployment of the latest generation AI platforms. Through our Building Block Solutions, we provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead time over our competition. Additionally, our rack-scale plug-and-play total solutions, especially with liquid cooling DLC, ensure optimal system performance while saving energy cost up to 40% at data center scale, delivering much more value to customers. We are leading the AI revolution by deploying NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to our customers, housed in our new 100 kilowatt racks, with 2 times to 3 times higher power density than traditional racks from others. At NVIDIA GTC last month, we unveiled our next-generation Blackwell products, including the GB200 NVL72 solution. To further grow our AI portfolio, we are now strongly focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the upcoming next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs as well as Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3 and AMD MI300X and MI300A GPUs. Most of them support both air cooling and DLC cooling. As Supermicro is transitioning to our next generation of X14 and H14 product lines featuring the industry's broadest SKUs of Intel XEON 6 processor-based and AMD Turin-based platforms, we are fully ready for high volume production and offer early online access for testing and validation through our JumpStart cloud service. Meanwhile, our X14 and H14 storage solutions are addressing the specific requirements of accelerated AI data pipelines with partners like Weka, VAST Data, and many others. The rapid growth of our business is raising the complexity to scale our capacity. Our production team are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories. We have secured the parts and acquired additional warehouses for our next phase of enterprise and data center businesses. We are currently on track to produce over 2,000 liquid cooling DLC racks per month of AI servers with volumes steadily increasing. Each DLC rack supports up to 100 kilowatt or even 120 kilowatt. At this moment, we are focusing on delivering more than 1,000 racks of NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputers, each rack supports 64 piece H100, H200 or B200 GPUs, with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology to three industry-leading customers, from April to June of this quarter. These three deployments will be among the world's largest DLC liquid-cooled AI clouds, potentially saving our customers up to 40% of energy costs compared to standard air-cooled deployments by our competition. Special thank you to NVIDIA and our close technology partners for this fantastic collaboration. I believe this is just the beginning of our long-term high volume DLC liquid cooling mission. Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. Let's go for Green! In summary, we had a strong quarter with more to come. Supermicro is uniquely capable of delivering new technologies to market faster with our integrated rack-scale plug-and-play solutions, in-house engineering, building block architecture, and green computing DNA. With a robust pipeline of new products in calendar year 2024, we're confident fiscal Q4 revenue will be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. This will raise our fiscal revenue guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, an increase to our recent fiscal 2024 guide. We continue to win market share and remain committed to executing our growth plans across all verticals. This remains truly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro, and I believe this strong year-over-year growth will continue in our fiscal 2025, especially with our new, leading and ready-to-ship DLC liquid cooling rack-scale plug-and-play solutions and technologies. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank you again to our partners, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders for your strong support. David? David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2024 revenues were $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. During Q3, we recorded $1.88 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 49% of revenues versus 40% last quarter, up 190% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, driven by industry recognition of our solution price-performance metrics and reliability. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $1.94 billion, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 59% in the last quarter, up 222% year-over-year and down 10% quarter-over-quarter. One existing CSP/large data center customer represented 21% of Q3 revenues and one existing enterprise/channel customer represented 17% of revenues. Emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $37 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and Storage Systems comprised 96% of Q3 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 4%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. By geography, U.S. represented 70% of Q3 revenues, Asia 20%, Europe 7%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 242%, Asia increased 257%, Europe increased 30%, and Rest of World increased 87%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia increased 17%, Europe increased 3%, and Rest of World decreased 11%. The Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.6%, up slightly quarter-over-quarter from 15.5% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs, gaining market share and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 72% year-over-year to $219 million driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year to $166 million. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, which was in-line with Q2 levels. Other income and expense for Q3 was $3.8 million, consisting of $6 million in interest expense and a gain of $10 million principally from foreign exchange. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities. The GAAP tax rate was negative 5.2% resulting in a tax benefit of $20 million for Q3. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 6% resulting in Q3 tax expense of $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower due to the impact of higher R&D tax credits and tax benefits from employee stock grants exercised. Q3 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.56 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.65 exceeded the high end of guidance through record revenues, stable gross margins and operating margins and lower tax rates. The GAAP share count increased from 58.1 million to 61.4 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 59 million to 62 million shares as a result of the two stock offerings and, to a lesser extent, the convertible bond offering. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $1.5 billion compared to cash flow usage of $595 million during the previous quarter as we grew inventory and accounts receivable for higher levels of business. Cash flows from strong profitability was offset by higher inventory, a large portion of which was received late in Q3, and higher accounts receivable from increasing revenues. Our Q3 closing inventory was $4.1 billion, which increased by 67% quarter-over-quarter from $2.5 billion in Q2 due to the purchase of key components. Capex was $93 million for Q3 resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter. During the quarter, we raised $1.55 billion from a 0% coupon five-year convertible bond offering due in 2029, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We also raised approximately $1.73 billion in net proceeds from the sale of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet cash position was $2.1 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $1.9 billion resulting in a net cash position of $252 million versus a net cash position of $350 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q3 cash conversion cycle was 96 days versus 61 days in Q2. Days of inventory increased by 25 days to 92 days compared to the prior quarter of 67 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 revenues. Days sales outstanding increased by 8 days quarter-over-quarter to 37 days while Days Payables Outstanding decreased by two days to 33 days. Now turning to the outlook for Q4, we expect strong growth as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.62 to $8.42. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially as we focus on driving strategic market share gains. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $226 million and include $55 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $28 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company's projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of minus 2.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 2.6%, and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million for GAAP and 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. For fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09. Our projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $116 million in expected stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects of $98 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. We're now ready for Q&A. Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong guidance. I have two questions. First, I wanted to ask a question on liquid cooling. Do you design most of the components for liquid cooling racks in-house? And as such, do you think you would be able to charge more for liquid-cooled racks? And can this be accretive to gross margins? Charles Liang : Yes, very good question. Yes, we design lots of key components for, DLC, liquid cooling system, because we care quality, maintenance, and also time to market. So, we design lots of key components while we leverage third-party components as well. So, it's a combination. And, yes, I mean, liquid cooling, we try to charge customer with a minimum premium, and customer can save kind of air-conditioned equipment cost because cool down my liquid, right? So, at the same time, customer will safe lots of TCO, up to 40% of energy cost. That's why we try to promote a slogan, \"green computing can be free with big bonus.\" Customer pay a very minimal premium, but they save up to 40% of energy cost. So, I believe a lot of customer will go for that direction. And, indeed, we already have a handful of customer have big order. That's why this quarter alone -- I mean, June quarter, we are preparing more than 1,000 liquid cooling rack for those early bird. And I believe the demand will continue to grow very strong. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess in the press release, Charles, you mentioned the visibility into share gains as the new solutions ramp. And I was curious if you can sort of give us a bit more color there in terms of when you're thinking about share gains, are these relative to the next-generation GB200 product with NVIDIA? And is this more in relation with sort of hyperscalers? Are you expanding the number of hyperscalers that you are engaged with as you move to these new solutions? Just any more color in terms of the visibility around these share gains? Where is that coming from? And is that more in relation to the next product generation from NVIDIA? Thank you. Charles Liang : Okay. Thank you. I mean, yes, we continue to gain market share, especially our rack-scale plug-and-play solution that reduce customers' lead time and also reduce customers' time to online. With our rack-scale plug-and-play, customer able to put the system -- deploy the system online in next day or next few days instead of the next few weeks. So, time to online saving is a big advantage to customer. At the same time, the liquid cooling, they help customer save energy power. So, customer can allocate, relocate the energy power to power more computing equipment instead of waste of power for air cool. So, same money, that benefit lots of leading customer, and also rack-scale plug-and-play that make customer time to online. So, we continue to gain more new customer. While our old customer continue to grow, started to grow faster with our beta offering. So, GB200 [indiscernible] right? GB200, each rack will be around 100 kilowatt. So, lots of customer like that. And we help them build their liquid cooling system and optimize their data center for liquid cooling. So, we are growing customer base strongly now. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Strong gross margins for the quarter. I know you're guiding to a sequential decline in gross margins. If our math is right, I think that implies 13.5% to 14% gross margins for the June quarter -- sorry, for the June quarter. Is that the right way to think about gross margins on a go-forward basis? Do you still feel comfortable with the prior 14% to 17% long-term gross margins? And any comments just around AI server gross margins in general? And if there are any ancillary services and support that can help improve the margins on just the product sales? Thank you very much. David Weigand : Yeah. So, our target is still 14% to 17%. If you look at our guide for Q2 -- I'm sorry, for Q3, we actually guided slightly down and we ended up slightly up. And so, it's very hard to guide exactly on the margins. There is a range, and in fact, I think the guide inside of -- inside the models last time was even more conservative. So, I would say, we build conservative -- we build conservatively and then seek to overachieve. So, I think, if you look at our guide for revenue and for OpEx, you'll be able to determine our guide there. But our target is definitely to stay in the 14% to 17% range. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try and slip in two here, if I can. So, I guess, one of the just kind of housekeeping questions is a very significant increase in inventory this quarter. I know you said it came in towards the end of the quarter. How do we think about the trajectory of inventory as the supply comes on? Do you expect inventory to stay at this level? Do you expect it to start to come down? I'm just kind of curious to how we think that flow through kind of looks as you take on more supply? And then just a quick housekeeping thing too is that, the 21% customer you referenced in the prepared remarks, is that the same customer, large customer you had last quarter, or how has that evolved? Thank you. Charles Liang : Two reasons we had to increase inventory. One is because Q4, I mean, June quarter, we will have a strong revenue growth. Second reason, because we're preparing for high volume liquid cooling. Again, we have more than 1,000 of 100 kilowatt liquid cooling rack we had to ship to customer in Q4. And liquid cooling, as you know, is pretty new. So, we had to prepare enough inventory, so that we can deliver liquid cooling rack-scale product to customer on time or with minimum lead time. So, both factor, indeed, is a positive factor though. With our economic of scale continue to grow, indeed, our inventory average day, indeed, will slightly improve. David Weigand : Yeah. So, Aaron, my take on that is I hope that our inventory continues to grow because that means there's a reason behind it. So, it's -- and it's tied to sales. So, to your second question, the 21% customer was, the same as last quarter. And I want you to -- I wanted to let you know that, in the Q, we're going to be moving to customer A, customer B, customer C, because as we add more customers, we'll try to make it easier to make those distinguishments. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of George Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open. George Wang : Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong June guide. I'd like to put in two parts. Quickly, just not asking for specific guidance for FY '25 or the September, December quarter, but any sort of high-level kind of color you can provide just to think about how to model the September, December and also the FY '25? And also kind of related, kind of can you parse out kind of utilization in the March quarter? And also kind of what's the expected utilization kind of cadence for the next few quarters? Charles Liang : Yeah. As you know, we have a lot of new product coming soon, right, to support NVIDIA, H200, B100, B200, GB200, and AMD MI300 and Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3. So, we have a lot of new product already, and plus, liquid cooling, DLC, we are ready to ship high volume product. So for sure, I mean, calendar -- I mean, fiscal year '25, I mean, for September, December quarter, we will be -- we will have a strong growth. And I believe this strong growth will continue for many quarter to come if not many years. I believe it will be many years. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Thanks guys for taking the question. Really appreciate it. And Charles, let me maybe, the remarks you made a moment ago about the strong ongoing growth, does that -- could that mean that you could also grow sequentially from this point forward for a little bit, just given the market share gain opportunities, the components coming online that you talked about in the new products? Any context on the way to think about sequential growth sort of in the coming quarters would be helpful as well. Thanks. Charles Liang : Yeah. As you know, traditionally, in last 10 years, right, I mean, September quarter and March quarter always our soft quarter. But now with AI demand growing so strong, so we basically are able to grow sequentially. So, although, March and September still a little bit weak, but, basically, because of strong AI growth and our market share growing, so the sequential growth will become normal. And, basically, I mean, we have even better technologies than before ever, and now economies of scale become much bigger. Malaysia campus, production will be ready by end of this calendar year. So, we see lots of positive factor to grow our business. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more to the gross margin and if you expect them to go structurally higher at some point in the near future, in the coming quarters. Especially if Malaysia ramps, you get economies of scale there as you transition to GPU products and you add more liquid cooling. Is there a point where that starts to revert higher? Or do you expect it to remain at a relatively constant level for the foreseeable future? Charles Liang : Again, the AI platform is getting popular, right? So, there are more and more competitor as well. So, we will try to keep a balance. To grow market share, we may, sometimes, some deal, we may have to be a little bit more aggressive in pricing. But, overall, we try to keep a balance. David, you may add something. David Weigand : Yeah. And also, I agree with your point that Malaysia will also offer some opportunity to us. And we're also at a transition time when there's a lot of new -- we have a lot of new platforms that are coming out and the customers are highly anticipating. And those platforms are built on some emerging technologies that from many different areas. And we -- Supermicro's strength again is its fast time to market, and we expect with these -- with the emerging technologies and our new platforms and our liquid cooling to be first out there with very compelling solutions. So, we think those things are all going to be helping our margins. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking the question. A couple for me. Regarding the channel customer, the 17% of the customer, have you ever had the channel customer that big? I believe in the past you've talked about the 21 -- 20%-plus customer, but I think this is new. Can you clarify this? David Weigand : So, this is an existing customer and we actually had a higher customer back in 2022, Mehdi, but I think they were around [22%] (ph). But this is still a really good customer, really good opportunity. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Great. And then, one question for you David on the cash flow. Actually, there was a -- I believe there are two items. There is a $110 million of cash burn in operation and then there was also a non-current asset. Am I missing something here? These two items were big items that had an impact to overall cash flow. Is that correct? David Weigand : Sure. We had a number of things that impacted us. I think in non-current assets, we had deferred taxes grew by quite a bit this year -- or this quarter, and so that was something unusual. And then, let's see, I think those are -- I think that's the only unusual item, was a deferred tax grew a lot and that's what lowered our tax rate -- our quarterly tax rate as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you, and congrats on a strong guide here. Talk about the guide here, inventory increased $1.5 billion Q-over-Q, and David, as you mentioned, you like to see inventory increase. I do too, because it's a strong indicator of things to come. And you've guided June quarter to increase by $1.6 billion Q-over-Q. If I do this math where I'm looking at the inventory at the quarter-end and then the four-quarter revenue, typically, it's around 60% to 70% of revenue. But with your March Q ending inventory and your current June Q guidance, that equates to about 85% of projected revenue. So, can you just explain what seems to be a little bit more usual inventory buildup given the revenue guidance range? David Weigand : Sure, absolutely. That's a fair question. So, we actually got a substantial amount of inventory in the last week of the quarter, okay, which obviously we're not going to be able to ship. But we took in $700 million in the last week of the quarter. So that's not something that -- that's something that has to do with when inventory arrives. And so, we -- it hurts our cash flow. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because we need that inventory for Q4 shipments. Charles Liang : Yeah. Again, two reasons, right? Q4, we will have a strong revenue. So, we had to prepare with Q4. And, also, I mean, liquid cooling, I mean, it's new. So, we had to prepare enough safety inventory for liquid cooling demand for June quarter and September quarter as well. So that's another reason why we have a slightly higher inventory now. David Weigand : Yeah. And I want to add, Nehal, that that's exactly why we did capital raises, too, is to prepare for these Q4 shipments, and so that we could make those large purchases and we hope to continue that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matt Bryson with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Matt Bryson : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I would be thinking with liquid cooling ramping in fiscal Q4, and not to harp on the gross margin issue, but that you would be seeing a benefit to gross margins. And I guess my question is, is there any chance that either with the liquid cooling solutions or with your other solutions, that you're again seeing some penetration at those larger customers and specifically hyperscalers, and that's why we're seeing gross margins come down? And I guess just one clarification for Dave. If you can provide the magnitude that revenues were affected by your inability to procure components in fiscal Q3? Thanks. Charles Liang : Let me add a little bit. Because liquid cooling is new to us, so to speed up quick support for some of our very important customer on June quarter, indeed, we had to pay some premium to speed up the supply. So, we spend a bunch of [indiscernible]. David Weigand : Yeah. So, the two questions, Matt, I would say, first of all, to the gross margin question, again, I try to give a -- my philosophy is, give a conservative [indiscernible] to beat that. And we were able to do that in Q3 and we'll do everything we can do it -- can do to beat it in Q4. But it'll depend also on what we ship. As to the magnitude of revenue, I'll go back to the fact that our backlog is at a record high. And so what that means is that every quarter we could have shipped more if we had more parts. And so therefore, it's an ongoing problem and we don't rely on that as an excuse. The fact of the matter is, we're glad to be able to produce the products that we're producing for some of the best companies in the world. And so, we continue -- we will continue to do that and we're very upbeat by the fact that the supply chain continues to improve each quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering if you could speak to your cash usage expectations over the next quarter or two. Are the proceeds from your recent capital raises all spoken for, as you look to the growth in the pipeline and record backlog you spoke to, or do you think that's more in reserve for growth further down the line? David Weigand : Yeah. So, the way I would answer that is that, I hope that I have -- that I need more capital, Jon, because that means that we're booking -- that we're growing revenues even faster. So, we've got capital adequate to get us through the current market, which means today. But in a week, that -- we hope that that changes, and we hope that we've got orders that require even more capital. So, all I can say is I hope that -- I'm hoping for the needs for more capital. Charles Liang : Yeah. We believe our revenue will continue to grow strong, and that's why we need more capital to grow faster. If we grow 20%, 30%, we may have enough capital now. But if we grow much faster, then for sure, we need more capital to grow stronger. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is a follow-up from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Hey, thanks. Thanks for the follow-up question. This is for Charles. Charles, with the capital base that you have now -- and I hear you, Dave, that you hope that you will need more capital. But with the capital base that you have now, technology advantage that you've always had that you've added to, is there anything else that you need in order to become the number one server vendor? Charles Liang : Yes. Indeed, our plan is very ambitious. Let me use that word. We have a very ambitious brand, so we try to continue grow very strong, kind of 3 times to 5 times faster than our industry's average. So, when that case happen, and we believe so, we hope so, then for sure we need more capital. Operator : Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. I'll see you in next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. Have an excellent rest of your day.",

Our first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, September 13th, 2024. And with that, I will turn it over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael. Today, I am pleased to announce another record quarterly result of $5.31 billion, a 143% year-over-year growth. For fiscal 2024, we have achieved $14.94 billion in revenue, a 110% year-over-year growth rate. To put this in perspective, our Q4 revenue has exceeded the full year revenue of fiscal 2022. Our robust growth is driven by our technology and product leadership in the AI infrastructure market, especially with Generative AI training and inferencing. We have been scaling quickly to secure a large share of AI CSP opportunities, deploying some of the largest AI SuperClusters in the world. Leveraging our system building blocks, we build and optimize rack-scale plug and play solutions with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology, helping our customers achieve the best TTD time-to-deployment and TTO time-to-online and lowest TCO with their AI solutions. Here are some key quarterly highlights. First, Supermicro is pleased to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q4 net revenue totaled $5.31 billion, up 143% year-on-year with a strong record high backlog. We could ship more if not for DLC liquid cooling component shortage. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $6.25 per share were well above $3.51 last year, which was 78% year-on-year growth. Our Q4 operating margin is 7.8%, which is lower than what we expected due to the higher mix of hyperscale datacenter business and expedited costs of our DLC liquid cooling components in June and September quarters. Some key new components shortage delayed about $800 million of revenue shipments to July, which lowered our EPS for June and will be recognized in our September quarter. The availability of our Malaysia facility later this calendar year and our dominating position in DLC liquid cooling total solutions will be instrumental in increasing our profitability. Supermicro is powering the largest AI factories around the world today. We believe more and more datacenters will be opting for our latest DLC liquid cooling solutions, which dramatically improves TCO relative to traditional air-cooled datacenters and is less environmentally taxing. We have proved that DLC solutions also offer higher performance and better uptime, with advantage to support the upcoming new AI chips. At Computex Taipei, I shared that Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. This means the cost of deploying liquid cooling DLC is on par with traditional air-cooled datacenter and significantly lowers the operational power cost. Since then, we have been delivering over 1,000 highly reliable DLC racks to multiple customers. Our goal is to quickly make DLC liquid cooling to be a mainstream solution for most datacenters and AI factories that focus on increasing efficiency and performance while reducing OpEx. We are targeting 25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months, with most deployments coming from Supermicro we believe. We are happy to help any customers transform and adapt their existing air-cooled datacenters to DLC liquid cooling in the coming years for four major reasons. First, it helps customers save energy costs up to 40%. Second, it boosts datacenter computing performance and third, it helps pull in customers' datacenter lead times or to be more precisely reduces their time to on-line because of less electrical power required and fourth, it reduces carbon footprint for our one-and-only mother earth. As an end-to-end IT infrastructure solutions company, our customers' experience is our number one priority. By leveraging our system building block and rack scale plug and play solutions, we help our customers achieve the best time-to-market advantage with new and performance optimized technologies. Now, we are further expanding this solution to the entire datacenter. With rapid deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure, datacenters worldwide are facing power shortages and cooling inefficiency challenges. Building these new AI-ready datacenters traditionally takes a long time, averaging three years for example. Our upcoming Supermicro 4.0 DCBBS, Datacenter Building Block Solutions will reduce customers' new datacenter build time from about three years to two years. For smaller facilities or old datacenter transformation, Datacenter BBS can enable an optimized, cost-effective datacenter in less than one year or even in just six months. This new offering will significantly improve datacenters' TTO time-to-online and cost, with full integration of AI compute, server, storage, networking, rack, cabling, DLC liquid cooling facility water tower, end-to-end management software, onsite deployment services and maintenance. We will start offering it later this calendar year. Playing a significant role in realizing our Datacenter BBS and providing additional economies of scale, our new Malaysia campus will start production this November. With its geographic advantages, we expect it to quickly ramp up shipping volume and improve our cost structure. In the US, we are adding new buildings and production POC provisioning capacity near our Silicon Valley headquarters as well, which will further boost our monthly DLC liquid cooling rack capacity and value this fiscal year. Moreover, we are on track to expand to a few other global manufacturing locations, leveraging our strength in product design, build quality, supply chain and deployment, positioning Supermicro as one of the largest IT infrastructure company. In summary, we are entering fiscal 2025 with record-high backorders, winning products, large volume DLC liquid cooling capacity, Datacenter BBS and more new customers. While our long-term investments impact short-term profitability, they position us well for future success by providing a sustainable competitive advantage and necessary economies of scale. This gives me confidence to forecast the September quarter revenue between $6 billion to $7 billion, and fiscal 2025 revenue between $26 billion to $30 billion. Again, we anticipate that the short-term margin pressure will ease and return to normal ranges before the end of fiscal 2025, especially when our DLC liquid cooling and Datacenter Building Block Solutions start to ship in high volume later this year. Lastly, I would like to announce a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Supermicro's common stock to make ownership of Supermicro stock more accessible. We are targeting trading on a split adjusted basis commencing at market open on October 1st, 2024. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to say thank you to our partners, customers, Supermicro employees on an incredible year where we were able to bring AI at scale to the world and to our shareholders for your continued support. David? David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. We had robust growth in the fiscal year, and I am pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives. For fiscal year '24, we reported revenues of $14.9 billion, representing 110% growth over fiscal year '23 revenues of $7.1 billion. Fiscal year '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $22.09 grew 87% over fiscal year '23 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $11.81. Between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24, we achieved significant operating leverage with revenues growing at a compound annual growth rate of 61% per year while non-GAAP operating expenses only grew at 19% per year. Between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24, gross margins have met or exceeded the target range of 14% to 17%. Non-GAAP operating margins were above the target range of 5% to 8% between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24 and more than doubled from 4.4% in fiscal year '21 to 10% in fiscal year '24 due to strong revenue growth and operating leverage. Q4 revenues were $5.31 billion, up 143% year-over-year and up 38% quarter-over-quarter, and above the midpoint of guidance of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. Growth was driven by strong demand for next generation air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled rack-scale AI GPU platforms, representing over 70% of revenues across enterprise and cloud service provider markets where demand remains strong. We exited the year with an acceleration in innovative DLC products, a large design win pipeline and a strong backlog, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal year 2025. We expect gross and operating margins to gradually increase in the year driven by product and customer mix, manufacturing efficiencies for new DLC AI GPU clusters and new platform introductions. As Charles discussed, shipments may continue to be constrained in the short-term by supply chain bottlenecks for key new components for our advanced platforms. However, long-term gross margins will benefit from lower manufacturing costs as we scale up production in Malaysia and Taiwan, in addition to expansion in the Americas and Europe. During Q4, we recorded $1.83 billion in the enterprise-channel vertical, representing 34% of revenues versus 49% in the last quarter, up 87% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment revenues were $3.41 billion, representing 64% of Q4 revenues versus 50% in the last quarter, up 192% year-over-year and up 76% quarter-over-quarter. Emerging 5G, Telco, Edge/IoT revenues were $75 million or 2% of Q4 revenues. For fiscal year '24, enterprise-channel revenues grew 79% to represent 41% of total revenues. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment grew 149% and represented 58% of total revenues. The emerging 5G, Telco, Edge/IOT segment represented 1% of total revenues. One CSP/large datacenter customer represented approximately 20% of revenues for fiscal year '24. Server and Storage Systems comprised 95% of Q4 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 5%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis driven by the value and complexity of rack-scale Total IT Solutions. By geography, US represented 61% of Q4 revenues, Asia 24%, Europe 10%, and Rest of World 5%. On a year-over-year basis, US revenues increased 94%. Asia increased 437%, Europe increased 128%, and Rest of World increased 386%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, US revenues increased 20%, Asia increased 66%, Europe increased 74% and Rest of World increased 187%. The Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 11.3% versus 15.6% in Q3 due to product and customer mix, focus on winning strategic new designs with competitive pricing and higher initial costs in ramping production of new DLC AI GPU clusters. For fiscal year '24, the non-GAAP gross margin was 14.2% versus 18.1% for fiscal year '23. We have a path to improve gross margins to the target range of 14% to 17% as we introduce innovative platforms based on multiple new technologies from our strategic partners and improved manufacturing efficiencies on our DLC solutions. Q4 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 15% quarter-over-quarter and 75% year-over-year to $253 million driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 11% quarter-over-quarter and 39% year-over-year to $185 million. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% versus 11.3% in Q3, due to the lower gross margins. Other income and expense for Q4 was $11 million, consisting of $3 million in interest expense and $14 million from interest income on higher cash balances offset by a loss from foreign exchange and other investments. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities. The tax provision for Q4 was $1 million on a GAAP basis and $21 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 0.3% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 5%. The GAAP tax rate was 4.9% for fiscal year '24 versus 14.7% in fiscal year '23 and the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.4% in fiscal year '24 versus 15.9% in fiscal year '23. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51 was below the guidance of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.25 was below the guidance of $7.62 to $8.42 due to lower gross margins and higher operating expenses in the quarter. The GAAP fully diluted share count increased quarter-over-quarter from 61.4 million to 64.2 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 62 million to 64.8 million shares reflecting the effects of the two recent stock offerings and the convertible bond offering. Q4 cash flow used in operations was $635 million compared to $1.52 billion in the previous quarter, as inventory and accounts receivable grew due to higher levels of business and the timing of shipments. For fiscal year '24, cash used in operations was $2.5 billion due to strong revenue growth of 110% and working capital needs to support large customer design wins. Q4 closing inventory was $4.4 billion in anticipation of future growth. CapEx for Q4 was $27 million resulting in negative free cash flow of $662 million for the quarter. CapEx for fiscal year '24 was $137 million up from $37 million in fiscal year '23 as we invested in new property, plant, and equipment globally, including our greenfield Malaysia plant. The Q4 closing balance sheet position was $1.7 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $2.2 billion resulting in a net cash position of negative $504 million versus a net cash position of $252 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q4 cash conversion cycle was 94 days versus 96 days in Q3. Days of inventory decreased by 10 days to 82 days compared to the prior quarter of 92 days. Days sales outstanding was unchanged at 37 days while days payables outstanding decreased by 8 days to 25 days. Now turning to the outlook for Q1 fiscal year '25, we expect strong growth as we ramp new air-cooled and DLC AI GPU design wins with new and existing customers. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect net sales in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $5.97 to $7.66 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $6.69 to $8.27. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially due to product and customer mix and improving manufacturing efficiency. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $282 million and include $84 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2025 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $48 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $35 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $20 million. The company's projections for Q1 fiscal year '25 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 9.9% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.6%, and a fully diluted share count of 65 million for GAAP and 66 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q1 to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million. For fiscal year 2025, we are introducing guidance for revenues from $26 billion to $30 billion. Michael, we're now ready for Q&A. Michael Staiger : Harry? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I guess, I have, two. Encouraged to see the revenue guidance for $26 billion to $30 billion for fiscal '25. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of color around the assumptions underpinning that revenue guidance and any visibility that you have in terms of backlog and some of the contingencies you might be assuming in terms of supply availability? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the growth in operating margin, improvement throughout the year. Should we think about the, the long-term gross margin targets as applicable for the full year as well or exiting the year? Thank you. Charles Liang : Okay. Thank you. I mean as to what we share, I mean, we continue to gain design wins and we see lots of new product available, including DLC liquid cooling and Datacenter Building Block Solutions, we see a lot of customer engagement and also more new customer like to engage with us. So with our capacity continue to grow $26 billion to $30 billion. That's our target for the next 12 months. And as to gross margin, as what we just mentioned, our DLC liquid cooling now have been very mature. So we are able to take advantage from that and also Datacenter Building Block Solutions that provides a much better value, improve customers' Datacenter time to online and also EG customers job to build their data center. So all of those will increase our profitability gradually. Michael Ng : Thank you, Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple as well. Maybe if I can start with the gross margin performance in the quarter. I know you mentioned you had a hyperscale customer, which impacted product customer mix and margin impact there. How should we think about sustainability or sort of repeat orders from that customer? It sounds like you're saying that's part of the improvement and you probably don't see as much repeat, but just wanted to confirm if that's how we should be thinking about the hyperscale customer you had, which is that it doesn't really repeat through fiscal '25. And I have a follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes. We have been very consistent. I mean before we are Silicon Valley based, operations was in Silicon Valley. So we focus on enterprise, high-quality, higher performance customer only, that's before. But when we start to take production operation advantage from Taiwan, we start to grow large-scale datacenter customer. And now we have a huge capacity in Malaysia, it will be ready by later this year. So with the economic large-scale advantage, we are waiting for a large customer. So we will continue to grow with large customers. At the same time, we also continue to enhance our enterprise customer base. So recently, we also see the growth in some demand from our enterprise with our software total solution, I mean Datacenter Building Block Solutions. We start to gain more attraction for the datacenter, I mean, enterprise customers as well. So we believe long-term economic scale, the enterprise customer base and overall Taiwan and Malaysia advantage cost advantage that we have a way to grow gross margin and net profit. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And for my follow-up, Charles, there have been reports more recently about the delay of the GB200 from NVIDIA. Just wondering if you can share your thoughts of how that would impact the conversion of the robust backlog or pipeline that you're looking at to revenue through the year? And is that accounted for when you talk about liquid cooling now being a materially higher portion than what you talked about at COMPUTEX. Are you taking some of those delays into account? Thank you. Charles Liang : Yes. I mean, yes, we heard NVIDIA may have some delay, right? And we treat that as a normal possibility. When they introduced new technology, new product, they are always have a chance to -- there will be a push out a little bit. In this case, it pushed out a little bit. But to us, I believe we have no problem to provide the customer with a new solution like H200 liquid cooling. We have a lot of customers like that. So although we hope better deploy in the schedule, that's good for a technology company, but this push out overall impact to us. It should be not too much. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them. The first one relates to the gross margin performance in the quarter. David, can you specify of the 430 bps sequential decline, how much was the result of the customer mix, which is the higher hyperscale customer mix versus the impact of ramping liquid cooling solutions? And how much was that impact to gross margins? And in terms of, I think, Charles, you said you lost about $800 million of revenue in the quarter because of nonavailability of components. Is that all liquid cooling related or was that related to other things like GPUs as well? Thank you. Charles Liang : Pretty much liquid cooling key components related. But now it's much ready now. I mean when we move to July, August, we have a much liquid cooling key components are available now. David Weigand : Ruplu, it wasn't a loss. It was pushed out into the next quarter. Yes. So there was -- we really -- we were surprised by the amount of demand that we had in this market. And so we -- our manufacturing efficiency improves -- has been improving every day. And so we expect that to continue and that's going to help our gross margins going forward as we deploy liquid cooled racks at scale. Ruplu Bhattacharya : And is that deployment expected to be linear for these liquid cool racks throughout the year or is it more back-end loaded? Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Charles Liang : Basically, we support a handful customer for liquid cooling. And most of them, once they try our liquid cooling, they will continue to deploy higher percentage with liquid cooling because the cost -- the hardware acquisition cost is about the same, but they will save a lot of energy costs. So I believe this growth will be consistently growing. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Charles, you said a lot of good stuff on this call. So I'll try to just ask about one or two things here. I guess to start, could you frame for us how the company is thinking about its liquid cooling capability relative to others who are providing liquid cooling service as well. That's been a big top of the conversation. It sounds like you guys are really high on your capability and it seems to be showing up at least in the guidance. But I think additional context around how you guys are competitively positioned and maybe some of the technical reasons why would be super useful for those. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you. I mean as you know liquid cooling have been in the market for 30 years and market share compared with overall datacenter size always small, less than 1% or close to 1%, I would have to say. But just June and July two months alone, we shipped more than 1,000 racks to the market. And if you calculate 1,000 racks, AI rack is about more than 15% on a global datacenter new deployment. So we are very happy. We are happy that the industry pushed from air cooled to liquid cooling and to help customer save energy costs and reduce carbon footprint. At the same time, because of the liquid cooling, DLC liquid cooling datacenters require 30% to 40% less power, that's why it's met customers' datacenter availability quicker because the customers don't have to wait for higher power budget from a powering company. So overall we see more customers like our liquid cooling solution. Ananda Baruah : And Charles did I hear you accurately that you guys think you did 50% liquid cooling share in the June quarter? Charles Liang : I believe for June and July in last next two months we may ship at least 70% to 80% or liquid cooling compared with all the liquid cooling in the world. So for liquid cooling, we have at least 70% to 80% market share. Ananda Baruah : That's useful. Thank you. And then just real quick, my follow-up is you've made remarks earlier this year in the recent past about how you envision expanding your rack capacity sort of over the sort of into the future. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how to think about, how you're thinking about rack capacity expansion for both liquid cooled and air cooled and that's it for me. Thanks. Charles Liang : It's a very good question. I mean, last month, we have about 1,000 racks per month liquid cooling capacity. And today, we already grow another 50%. So now we have a 1,500 rack per month capacity. By this year-end, we will grow that to 3,000 rack per month. That's with liquid cooling alone. So we really believe liquid cooling is a much better choice for the market and we provide kind of consultation to customers. And most of the customer when discuss with our engineering team, they love liquid cooling. And again, we are growing customer base for liquid cooling very strongly. And we're really happy for that because minimized power consumption have been common value to the world and especially save operation costs. Ananda Baruah : And that's fiscal year fiscal year you say end of the year and the fiscal year? Charles Liang : For the next 12 months, I believe, liquid coding will be a big portion of our business. Ananda Baruah : Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Aaron C. Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. I guess I want to go back to the earlier question on Blackwell just because I think it's going to be a key focal point for a lot of investors here especially as we kind of shape the full year guidance. So Charles I want to be clear. So has your guidance contemplated as we think about the December quarter, do you believe that you'll be shipping the Blackwell platform solutions for revenue in the December quarter or should we think about the full year guide is a bit more weighted to the back half of the fiscal year given some of these concerns around the timing of Blackwell availability and NVL36 and NVL72 platforms, et cetera. I'm just curious of how you want us to say for the street to think about the cadence of that full year guidance shaping up on a quarterly basis. Appreciate you're not going to give quarter-by-quarter guidance. Charles Liang : Yes. Thank you. I mean, indeed, we are relatively very conservative. I understand Blackwell may postpone how much we don't exactly know because the new technology always what can be pushed out, right? So for Q3, for sure, we do not expect any Blackwell volume. For Q4, I mean December quarter, I guess, it will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion. Aaron Rakers : Yes. That's very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, I want to go back to kind of the gross margin discussion too. We talked about the impact of the DLC platforms. You talked about product mix. One of the other comments, David, you had made was that winning strategic new customers was a factor in that 430 basis point gross margin degradation. Can you help us appreciate what exactly the impact of that has been? How that might have changed this last quarter? And then I'll flip my final one in. Any disclosure on purchase obligations coming out of this last quarter? Thank you. David Weigand : Yes. Thanks. I'll answer those in reverse order. We don't have any announcements in terms of purchase obligations and so we'll point you to the 10-K for that. But with respect to your first question, I would say, we prepared the market for a downturn in margins or a softening of margins in our guidance last quarter. But even we were surprised by the acceleration that we saw in the liquid cooled rack market. And so we had to ramp up our supply chain. We paid a lot of expedite costs and higher supply chain costs. So I think as the supply chain improves, we expect those efficiencies to now come back out, but that impacted us more than we had expected. Charles Liang : Especially for June quarter. David Weigand : Yes, for the June quarter. Aaron Rakers : Is that the majority of the -- was that the majority for the 430 basis point decline? David Weigand : Well, no, I think. No, so half was targeting specific accounts like we announced last quarter. And the other half was really the higher supply costs that we encountered. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of George Wang of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. George Wang : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two parts. Firstly, can you give more color just in terms of share gains, especially within the hyperscale arena? Traditionally, Supermicro has been more Tier 2, Tier 3 enterprise. And you guys talked about higher mix on hyperscale. Just curious does that mean you guys are winning new penetration to the hyperscale space? Charles Liang : Yes. Again like what I just mentioned with our Taiwan capacity is getting bigger and Malaysia capacity will be ready. So we're fully ready for large scale datacenter customer, but we will be selective. So that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion. If we try to be more aggressive in a large scale, our growth can be even faster than that. But we try to grow in both ways enterprise and large scale datacenter kind of try to balance so to maintain our healthy profitability. George Wang : Okay. Great. Just a second question, if I can squeeze in. Just as we enter the Blackwell era with liquid cooling kind of larger deployments, higher ASP, but also comes with some potential working capital need. Just in terms of the capital raise, is that fair to say you guys are sufficient or there could be some potential to come to the market? Just maybe you can talk about the puts and takes for the next 12 months. Charles Liang : Liquid cooling, I mean, for sure, is necessary and it's very helpful for Blackwell solution. Although Blackwell solution pushed out a little bit. But indeed we enable liquid cooling for H100 and H200 as well and a lot of customers are interested in our H100 and H200 liquid cooling now indeed. So liquid cooling to from our position we'd like to support the whole datacenter not just Backwell. George Wang : Okay. Can you address on the working capital if you can give any color on that? David Weigand : Yes. So we announced a $500 million credit line with a group led by the Bank of America. And so we expect we are really working on our balance sheet and leveraging our balance sheet. And we expect to some announcements to be coming in terms of additional loan possibilities in the future. George Wang : Okay. Great. I will go back to the queue. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng of CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk, given your time to market and volume capabilities and liquid cooling, the energy and compute advantages, can you walk through what your pricing strategy is and why not pass those costs on especially relative to the value that you're providing? Is it a stronger competitive environment close to behind you or are you effectively trying to get ahead of them and get that share first? Charles Liang : Yes, I mean, indeed, the liquid cooling from our point of view it is really a good value to the whole market and our whole planet because of less energy consumption, right? So we enable liquid cooling primarily for Blackwell, right, because Blackwell higher power that's for sure. Lots of cases need liquid cooling. But we enable that for H100, H200 and regular CPU as well. Because overall liquid cooling once mature, once economical scale is good enough, it's good for all different kind of computing. And not exactly now, we are deploying, we are promoting. Lot of our customer continue to interest in our liquid cooling even enough for Blackwell. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned getting back to the gross margin target range by the fiscal year-end. Can you help us narrow down a little bit more where in that target range you expect to be at the low end? Is it more towards the middle kind of help us understand how you're getting there? Charles Liang : Okay. For June, it's really a unique quarter because we deploy lots of liquid cooling and we pay lots of exploration cost. So that makes our June gross margin much worse. But now, indeed, our liquid cooling technology have been getting very mature, and we have a high volume now. So that though our liquid cooling cost are now. And however we try to promote liquid cooling as a mainstream product solution. So we try not to add the value too much to customers. But, instead, we try to gain market share and make liquid cooling everywhere. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Okay. Thank you. And any color just on where in the margin range you expect to end up? David Weigand : Well, so we, I think if you look at the guidance that we gave for Q1, we expect to be above 12% in the first quarter. And we're doing -- we'll be working very hard to move back into the range as we mentioned as soon as quickly as we can. Charles Liang : Especially with our commissioned Datacenter Building Block Solutions with more software, on-site deployment, maintenance and kind of end-to-end management service. So our profit margin should grow from a Building Block Solution for Datacenter very soon. Jonathan Tanwanteng : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I just have two housekeeping item. David, what kind of other income did you have in the June quarter. You did say that you had interest income of $12 million that you realized in the June quarter? David Weigand : That was a net figure, Mehdi. So we actually had $20 million of interest income, but that was offset by some adjustments too, some investment adjustments which brought down lower. Mehdi Hosseini : But the $20 million is that interest income. The $20 million is that interest income? David Weigand : $20 million was interest income, yes, from higher cash balances. That was offset by some investments. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. All right. And then a question I have for Charles. Obviously, you've done a good job of doubling revenue in fiscal year '24. But you also had a negative free cash flow of $2.6 billion. And if I were to look at the high end of your revenue guide for fiscal year '25, you're on track to double revenues again. Does that mean that you're going to need to burn another $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of free cash flow to hit those revenue targets? Charles Liang : Not necessarily. I mean if we try to be very aggressively growing market share maybe if example we forecast on $30-something billion, right, so in that case, we may need more. But if we try to focus on below $30 billion then not necessary. David Weigand : And Mehdi, one thing I would add to that is we believe that we have an IG profile. And as such, like I mentioned earlier, we're starting to leverage our balance sheet more with targeting toward unsecured debt. And so that will help us on an inter-quarter basis. Mehdi Hosseini : Got you. Thank you. What should I assume for fiscal year '25 CapEx? David Weigand : No. We don't have -- we're not giving a guide at this time. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. But would it be down on a year-over-year basis since most of the expansion in Malaysia and US are behind us? David Weigand : Well we have other projects going on expansion here in the US, but we'll -- nothing to announce today. Mehdi Hosseini : Got you. All right. Thank you, Dave. Operator : Our next question today is from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. I want to talk about DLC and some of the chatter that's been out there from some competitors and that, it sounds like failure rates for DLC, broadly speaking, not necessarily for Super Micro is high relative to air-cooled. Can you comment on what is Super Micro's DLC failure rates relative to air-cooled and then also relative to other DLC solutions. And I guess maybe we can do it on a per-node basis annualized failure rates or whatever basis you want to utilize? Charles Liang : Yes. We spent a lot of effort in last, I would like to say, two years to prepare our optimized DLC solution, including lots of new design, redesign, refining the components of the system. So finally, I mean, about May this year, right, we have our DLC solution for you ready. And we have more than a handful, high-profile customers who really like our DLC solution. That's why we're deploying the solution to them and that's why we paid lot of exploration charge, right? But now the good thing is our whole DLC solution has been very mature and ready for really high-volume production. So now for any customer want DLC, we are able to support them quickly and with a much reasonable cost now. So looking forward, I mean, DLC, I believe, will be a really popular solution for the world because it's more efficient, especially energy saving. So we are very happy that we establish DLC solution much ahead of anyone else. Again like June and July, I believe, we have at least 70% or 80% maybe even higher market share in the world for DLC. And air-cooled, again, we have been -- have a very optimized air-cooled solution. So we continue to promote air-cooled solution for sure. Nehal Chokshi : And do you have any thoughts on the actual like failure rates relative to air-cooled and then relative to other suppliers DLC solutions? Charles Liang : Yes, liquid cooling, as you know, because a very high efficient in cooling, right? So they allow CPU, GPU other components running at a lower temperature. And then in lot of case, indeed, are able to optimize customers' datacenter performance by percentage, right, a couple of percentage to even high single-digit percentage. So a lot of customers really like DLC at this moment. Nehal Chokshi : So are you saying that you actually can achieve lower failure rates with DLC because you can run the GPUs at lower temperatures. Charles Liang : CPU, GPU and other components at a lower temperature that which you have the kind of the whole datacenter quality, uptime, availability time. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then my follow-up question is that, I think, June 21st, you did an 8-K after market close, leasing significant datacenter space from prime datacenter and then you're leasing it back to Lambda Labs. It seems like a rather odd arrangement. Can you guys talk about the purpose of doing this? David Weigand : So we consider ourselves experts in datacenter solutions. And so this is really just one more facet of being a total provider. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Thomas Blakey of Key Corp. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thomas Blakey : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a few here. David, could you comment on the mix shift -- mix rather of AI rack scale revenue here in the quarter? Was it -- did it increase quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter? David Weigand : Absolutely. I mean our revenues went up -- over a $1.5 billion and that was primarily driven by liquid cooled racks. Thomas Blakey : Okay. Excellent. And an update maybe on the capacity utilization did that increase as well or decrease? And relatedly to that, you commented last quarter that there would be a number, I think of about 1,000 rack per month going out at a 64 GPU configuration? Could you give an update in terms of did you shipped those to the three customers? One was new in the June quarter? And again an update on the capacity utilization related to that question. Charles Liang : Yes. Customers like our high density computing solution especially per rack. That's why you say 64 GPU or more GPU, right? So we are very efficiently provide the customer for whatever configuration they like. And very soon we will allow something even better for sure. Thomas Blakey : So that -- so to be clear is that a yes that you shipped 3,000 racks during the quarter at that configuration to those three customers? Charles Liang : We are building that capacity for that because how many customers will move to DLC, especially when Blackwell ready. So we are very optimistic for that, especially after Blackwell in high volume production. And we have many Blackwell ready optimized system and rack scale design. David Weigand : Yes. But Thomas the 1,000 per month was the capacity. We're not saying that we shipped 1,000 per month. But one thing I can tell you is that the efficiency, yes. Thomas Blakey : That's clear. Okay. Operator : Thank you. And we have run out of time for any further questions. So this will conclude the Super Micro Computer Incorporated Q4 2024 Earnings Call.

Our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, December 13, 2024. With that, I will turn it over to Charles. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael. Before we dive into the first quarter details, I would like to share some thoughts on the recent challenges that the company has experienced. As we have emphasized in our filings since these challenges emerged, we remain confident in our previous financial reports. And as previously announced, we are actively in the process of engaging a new auditor. We are working with urgency to become current again with our financial reporting. I am pleased to report that the Special Committee has today provided the following statement to Super Micro, which is also included in our press release. I quote, \"The Special Committee has completed its investigation based on a set of initial concerns raised by Ernst & Young. Following a three-month investigation led by Independent Counsel, the Committee's investigation to date has found that the Audit Committee has acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors. The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measurement for the company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next. The Special Committee has other work that is ongoing but expects it to be completed soon.\" End of quote. The Special Committee has not otherwise provided any additional details or information. We look forward to receiving the committee's full report in the near future. We do not believe the current challenges affect Super Micro's ability to service our customers and partners as we continue to grow rapidly and strongly with the AI revolution, and my confidence in Super Micro and its staff remains stronger than ever. Here are some key quarterly highlights. The preliminary fiscal Q1 net revenue was in the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion. At the mid-point, this is up 181% year-on-year, driven by strong AI demand from our old and new customers. It was one of our strongest first quarters in history, despite many customers are waiting for the coming soon new generation GPU chips. The preliminary fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.76 per share versus $0.34 last year, approximately a 122% year-on-year growth rate. The preliminary non-GAAP gross margin is approximately 13.3% and non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 9.9%. Both were higher than the previous quarter as customer mix improved, and supply chain costs and expedited shipment eased for DLC components. We have deployed the world\u2019s largest DLC AI supercluster with 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a record time-to-deployment, TTD, as well as time-to-online. This milestone achievement reflects our engineering expertise and complex logistics capabilities for large scale AI infrastructure deployment. Leveraging our Datacenter Building Block Solutions, DCBBS, we are now building full scale liquid cooled datacenters with our Rack Scale Plug And Play solutions featuring our latest DLC liquid cooling technology at a leading pace. DCBBS, Datacenter Building Block Solutions, can reduce the time required for customers to build new datacenters from roughly two years to a few quarters, significantly improving datacenter TTD, time-to-delivery, and TTO, time-to-online and cost for customers' AI IT infrastructure. Datacenter Building Block Solutions is also helping to accelerate the adoption of DLC, direct liquid cooling, driving efficiency and performance while reducing customers' OpEx, achieving greener computing. We expect 15% to 30% of new datacenters will adopt liquid cooled infrastructure in the next 12 months. The DLC volume is at least 10x more than last year -- I mean, this year, DLC market share will be at least 10x more than last year due to the DLC liquid cooling product maturity and the rapid growth of AI. To keep the DLC solutions performing at their best, our new Super Cloud Composer, SCC, is capable of end-to-end management from chip level all the way to rack level and datacenter cooling towers, making it the most powerful DLC datacenter management software on the market today. SCC further simplifies provisioning of a highly automated, software-defined infrastructure, supporting customers with rapidly changing workload requirements. With the addition of SCC, Super Micro is well prepared to service many more customers and grow DLC liquid cooling datacenter market share. On the production front, we are in the process of completing our new Malaysia campus, where we expect to begin manufacturing later this quarter. Additionally, we have been nonstop expanding our facilities in Silicon Valley to increase DLC rack-scale production capacity. Now they are boasting 15 Megawatts of power and able to produce more than 1,500 DLC GPU racks per month, with plans to scale up further. Our Taiwan and Europe production facilities also are growing at a quick pace. Moreover, we are planning to expand to several other global manufacturing locations in the near future. By leveraging our strengths in technology innovation, product design, build quality, supply chain management, deployment and datacenter services, we are pursuing our goal to transform Super Micro into a leading USA, as well as worldwide AI IT infrastructure company. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2025. Our Total IT solutions deployments are rapidly scaling and our new product developments are progressing smoothly. Our NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 is ready and the 10U air-cooled, and 4U liquid-cooled B200 rack PnP systems are fully production-ready. The brand new 200KW+ SuperRack architecture, co-developed with NVIDIA, which provides near 100% DLC, I mean, the whole rack, almost no cooling fan required, is also on the right track. The new SuperRack architecture will be able to achieve Power Usage Effectiveness, PUE, close to 1.0. To complete our broadest AI portfolio, the AMD MI300 and MI325 platforms and Intel Gaudi 3 solutions are ready to go as well. Our Datacenter Building Block Solutions is attracting more new customers and our long-term investment in DLC is paying off with world-class quality and volume capacity, giving us a sustainable competitive edge and economies of scale. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our CFO, I want to thank our partners, customers, investors and Super Micro employees and express my appreciation for their patience and support until we can provide more information about our 10-K filing status. Our strong foundation, Datacenter Building Block Solutions and DLC green computing leadership, not only reduce energy cost for our customers, but also contribute to a healthier, Mother Earth. I believe we are well positioned for strong future growth. David Weigand : Thank you, Charles. We remind investors that the unaudited interim financial information in this report is preliminary. We expect unaudited Q1, Fiscal Year '25 revenues in the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, up 181% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter versus our guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion. Growth was driven by strong demand for Direct Liquid Cooled rack-scale AI GPU platforms. AI contributed over 70% of revenues across enterprise and cloud service provider markets. The expected Q1 non-GAAP gross margin is approximately 13.3% versus 11.3% last quarter due to product and customer mix and lower costs coupled with higher manufacturing efficiencies on DLC AI GPU clusters. The Q1 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 9.9% excluding $67 million in stock-based compensation expenses versus 7.8% in Q4. The Q1 estimate for other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $9 million, consisting of $17 million in interest expense offset by $8 million in interest and other income. The Q1 tax rate is approximately 14% for GAAP and 16% for non-GAAP. The Q1 estimate for GAAP net income is $433 million to $443 million and non-GAAP net income is $483 million to $493 million. Non-GAAP net income excludes $50 million in stock-based compensation expenses, net of the related tax effects of $17 million. The split-adjusted Q1 GAAP diluted EPS range is approximately $0.68 to $0.70 versus prior guidance of $0.60 to $0.77. The Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS range is approximately $0.75 to $0.76 versus guidance of $0.67 to $0.83. We expect a Q1 GAAP diluted share count of 639 million and a non-GAAP diluted share count of 648 million. Operating cash flow is approximately $407 million, an improvement of $1 billion quarter over quarter. Q1 closing inventory was approximately $5 billion. CapEx for Q1 was $42 million. Positive free cash flow was $365 million for the quarter. The Q1 closing balance sheet cash position was $2.1 billion and total debt was $2.3 billion with bank debt of $0.6 billion and convertible bond debt of $1.7 billion, resulting in an improved estimated Q1 net cash position of approximately negative $0.2 billion versus a net cash position of negative $0.5 billion last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q1 cash conversion cycle was 97 days versus 94 days in Q4. Days of Inventory was 85 days compared to the prior quarter of 82 days. Days Sales Outstanding for Q1 was 41 days versus 37 days last quarter, while Days Payables Outstanding was 29 days from 25 days last quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect net sales in the range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin down 100 basis points sequentially due to customer and product mix. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses up approximately $34 million sequentially and GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. We expect GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.48 to $0.58 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.56 to $0.65. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, assume a tax rate of 14.0% and 15.0% respectively, a diluted share count of 640 million shares for GAAP, and a diluted share count of 648 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2025, GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $54 million in expected stock-based compensation expense and other expenses, net of related tax effects of $14 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. The final financial results reported for this period may differ from the results reported here based on the review by the new independent registered public accounting firm to be appointed. We are working diligently to select a new independent registered public accounting firm and complete our fiscal year '24 audit. Michael, we're ready. Michael Staiger : Thank you, David. Before we get into questions, we appreciate you may have further questions about the special committee's findings as well as our audit time line. We're not in a position to address those questions on the call today. So, with that, operator, we'll take a first question. Operator : We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. The first comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Michael Ng : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Just on the business fundamentals, revenue came in at the lower end of the guidance. I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you're seeing any market share losses as a result of some of the delayed financial filings? And how do you feel about the $26 billion to $30 billion full year revenue guidance that you previously gave out? And are you hearing from any customers that once this resolution occurs, they'll be able to step up some of their orders? Or is it a gating factor? Thank you. Charles Liang : Okay. Thank you for the question, Michael. Indeed, last quarter, revenue reduced a little bit. I guess the major reason because there are some customers waiting for the new chip, the Blackwell chip, as you know. So people are waiting for the new solution. And the new solution, the Blackwell-based liquid cooling, air cooler, or GP200, our solution is ready. That's waiting for a chip. So, I guess that's the major reason. And our capacity continues to grow, and our liquid cooling solution is fully ready. Again, we can produce 1,500 liquid cooler racks per month now. So, we are fully ready. That's waiting for the new chip to be available. And then I believe we can grow our market share and revenue after that. Michael Ng : Great. And for David, just on the full year guidance. David Weigand : Yes, Michael, we're not providing annual guidance on this call. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you, Charles. Thank you, David. Charles Liang : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to sort of talk about the gross margins here. You had robust gross margins in the quarter, but you're guiding it down. It seems like maybe it's a bit more choppy in terms of gross margins depending on customer mix. Does the sort of progression before getting back to the 14% to 17% that you talked about earlier still remain sort of the base case? Or are you having to sort of discount more or be more aggressive on pricing on the current generation products? And as separate sort of a side question, just I know you're not commenting on related to the filings, but any management changes or any changes in how you operate that you're planning or thinking about to sort of overall improve things in terms of getting more sort of more disciplined around and more control around the financial reporting? Thank you. Charles Liang : Thank you, Samik. Yes. I mean, it depends on new product, right, when new GPU chip available. As you know, whenever there are new generation of technology, we have an advantage to grow our market share and profitability. And at the same time, our data centers are building broad solution with SCC, Siebel, Michael, Carl, Composer. They provide a full end-to-end solution. That for sure, we are gradually growing our gross margin and net margin. As to management team, yes, we are always faster growing. You know, 2023, we grew 40% about. And then 2024, we grew more than double. And this year, again, we will have a big growth. So, when company are faster growing, we continue to add more people, including senior management. So we are evaluating the possibility, including the report from special committee. And we, by the nature, we continue to grow senior management team as well. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. A couple if I can as well. Charles, I want to go back. I think when you guys had originally guided this quarter, I think the guidance range is like $6 billion to $7 billion. You came in at about $500 million at the midpoint short of that. I guess, given the comments to the prior question, are you assigning that to just the timing of Blackwell? Or was there something that changed in the demand or the timing of deployments this last quarter? I'd also add in there. I think last quarter when you had set that guide. I think there was like $800 million of sales that you had alluded to as being pushed out of last quarter into the fiscal first quarter. Did that all close? I'm just trying to bridge that gap for me between the delta and the guide relative to the business update today. Charles Liang : Okay. Good. I mean this is a complicated question. So I believe the major impact is new chip availability. Because Blackwell chip for sure is much higher performance, much better performance per dollars, right? And the good thing is that it will be available gradually. And Q1 hopefully, Q1 2025 volume become much better. And so that's the major factor, I believe. As to our 10-K delay may impact a little bit, how much I don't know yet, but a certain impact for sure, but hopefully not too big. As to the whole year, yes, today, we do not provide annual guidance basically with our detailed edge, right. In last few months, we deliver more than 2,000 rack DLC. That, I believe, is a very high percentage for the whole deep cooling market. So, for the future growth, is still very optimistic. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And then two other quick questions, if I can. So, first of all, I mean, you mentioned $5 billion of inventory coming out of this quarter. Any thoughts of where that might trend coming out of this next quarter embedded in your outlook that you provided today? And then I apologize for asking, I know that you're not going to address the special committee dynamic. But any thoughts on the timing of getting an auditor to sign. Anything you can share on that front? I appreciate that you ask, we're not talking much about that, but I'm curious, any comments on that front. Charles Liang : Okay. For inventory, maybe I can answer a little bit. I mean the company will continue to grow; I believe. So, $5 billion level of inventory, I believe will continue. And as to the special committee investigation results today, I'm very happy to share some very positive innovation as for detail once it's available from them, we will share with the market. David Weigand : And Aaron, we have no update with respect to the time line that we talked about, as we mentioned earlier. We're working diligently to get that done, as I mentioned, as quickly as possible. Aaron Rakers : Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The following comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may proceed. Ananda Baruah : Yes, guys. Good afternoon, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. I guess the first is on gross margin. Dave, should we still expect it to improve as we go through the fiscal year as you were previously anticipating? David Weigand : Yes. So, by the way, we guided cautiously in this first quarter on our margin. So, we were glad to be able to exceed it. And so in like fashion, we're guiding conservatively into the second quarter. And so, we still have our target margin that we're shooting for. And so we're doing everything that we can to improve that. Charles Liang : Yes. The competition is still putting some pressure. As you know, but Blackwell, I mean a new technology push and feel very optimistic with a chance to grow. And as I mentioned, the Datacenter Building Block Solutions including SCC, Super Cloud Composer that provide end-to-end management from chip level to rack scale to the whole data center. So, I believe all of those will help our growth. And then we are also able to provide the customer on-site deployment, on-site cable and service. So all of those are very positive to our business. I feel very positive to continue to grow business. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Thanks for the margin context. I appreciate that. And the follow-up is just a general working capital financing question. This question has come up with a lot with investors. And really, the question is can you explain sort of the access to capital situation as we go forward? And I guess, really, how would you like the investment community to think about the access to capital situation as we go forward? And I guess, really, how would you like the investment community to think about the access to capital situation? Thanks. David Weigand : Sure. So Ananda, we put in the last eight, nine months, $4 billion into working capital from two equity raises and one convert. And so that's really -- it really left us with a good working capital situation exiting Q4 at a run rate of around $1 billion -- of $6 billion. So again, we're forecasting a little down in Q2. So that takes care of our working capital needs for a while. So access, we have a very strong, growing and profitable company. And so we don't believe that we'll have any impediments to raising working capital. Charles Liang : Yes, quarterly -- every quarter, we are making a reasonable good net profit, though. So basically, we should be in a good shape. Ananda Baruah : Okay, guys. Thanks, so much. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from George Wang with Barclays. You may proceed. George Wang : Okay, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click on which quarter do you think that you will start booking the Blackwell revenue revenue? Last time you guys alluded to sometime in the June quarter. Just curious whether that is still on track. Just any kind of high level in terms of when do you think the Blackwell is going to show up in the P&L? Charles Liang : Yes, very big question. Indeed, we're asking NVIDIA every day. So I hope their production can go smooth and go for high-volume very soon. And once they have chip available, our solutions are full ready. So, we continue to work with them very closely to develop a current product, GB200, NVL72 and B200 nuclear-cooled and air-cooled. And we also designed some really enhanced rack scale solutions. So, in terms of total solutions, we have a very strong offering waiting for the chip. So, we need immediate and quicker support. Thank you. George Wang : Well, that's helpful. Just a quick one, if I can. Just how to think about gross margin in the area of Blackwell versus Hopper. Just curious if you can talk about puts and takes on the gross margin for the GB 200, especially in light of reference design from NVIDIA, any kind of incremental value add from Super Micro just as we kind of hand to the Blackwell just in relation to the profitability and the kind of margin profile? Thank you. Charles Liang : Yes, thank you. By the way, for sure, we estimate more competitive, right, because people know AI market is so big now. So, with Blackwell, we expect more competition. But at the same time, we also were prepared by our Datacenter Building Block Solutions with our end-to-end Super Cloud Composer and with our on-site deployment, cabling service business. So those are new. And I believe we are able to provide a very unique, very efficient time-to-delivery, time-to-online advantage to customers. So yes, competition is strong, but I believe we are in a good position. George Wang : Okay. Thanks a lot, Charles. I\u2019ll go back to the queue. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The following comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. You may proceed. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions, please. First, Dave, any 10% customer exposures in the quarter and the upcoming quarter? David Weigand : Indeed, we will have 10% customers, Nehal. Nehal Chokshi : Could you give us some detail as far as what percent of overall revenue due to 10% customers represent in the September quarter? David Weigand : Yes. So we're not going to release that data today. Charles Liang : Yes. But at the same time, we continue to gain more new customers, especially in Europe and Asia. So I believe we will be able to keep a healthy ratio. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Great. And then Charles, I think there's a strong feeling in the investment community that the Chairman and CEO roles, if separated, could be quite beneficial to Super Micro. From your perspective, what is the benefit of Super Micro separating these roles? Charles Liang : Okay. Why would I base it on a company? That's my consideration. So, every day -- if not every day, then every week, I have been thinking about that question since many years ago. And so, again, why would I base it on a business? So, I personally have a very open mind and technology guy and technology in my best interest. But still, overall consideration is the best benefit for shareholders and the company. Nehal Chokshi : And just to be clear, do you see it potentially being in the best interest of the shareholder of that separating these roles there? Charles Liang : No comment at this moment, but I'm considering about that. And someday, I will retire it. Hopefully, not in one year or two years. But sooner or later, I will retire. So I mean those changes for sure is a natural base of shareholders and for our company. And for my family too. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you for taking my question. Charles Liang : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. You may proceed. Vijay Rakesh : Hi, Charles. On the September quarter in December, I\u2019m just wondering how many liquid cool racks we are shipping in September and if you have some idea in December? Charles Liang : David, maybe do you have some number this year? David Weigand : It was just a little below last quarter but I don't have the exact... Charles Liang : I would have to say, we had a company ship most of liquid cooling racks to the market recently. For example, in the September quarter. And our liquid cooling because ahead of the market. So -- and customers like our liquid cooling because save their energy power and safe water requirements and kind of the trend. So I believe we will continue to grow liquid cooling percentage. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And when you say down sequentially into December quarter on the H200 liquid cooling. Any idea on how much that is sequentially? Charles Liang : We did not share that number, but I believe this cooling will continue to grow very quickly. And we are very happy to promote that. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And just last question on\u2026 Charles Liang : Go ahead, Vijay. Vijay Rakesh : Sorry. I think, David, on the November 16 deadline, are you guys comfortable that you will have an auditor and file a plan to the NASDAQ? David Weigand : So we're not answering those questions today. So we -- we're -- like I said, we're diligently looking to replace the auditor as quickly as possible. And we will be filing a plan with NASDAQ and indeed regarding an extension. And so -- but that's all we have to say about that. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. You may proceed. Jon Tanwanteng : Hi, Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, Charles or David, could you break out what your expected revenue in in Blackwell was supposed to be in the Q1 guidance and what you have implied in the Q2 guidance finance, first of all? And then second, do you see a risk of supply or allocations due to this auditor and filing issue, especially from NVIDIA, just would they possibly maybe hold back some just until you figure it out? Or are they supporting you through this and just meeting your orders and especially with the new technology? Charles Liang : Yes, our relationship with NVIDIA has been multiple decades. And our growth kind of cooperation between two companies continue to enhance. So we have many important projects co-developed and I don't expect and then negative allocation from them. So at this moment, according to our relationship according to our communication, things very positive. Jon Tanwanteng : Great. And then I guess, the Blackwell numbers that were implied in the last quarters and this quarter guidance? Charles Liang : That's hard to answer because we don't know how -- what's the volume NVIDIA, we have rate available every month. So we work with them very closely and co-develop solutions, validate a solution and service the common customer. So once they have no volume available, I believe we will have a good percentage in our product mix. Jon Tanwanteng : Got it. And then if I could sneak one more in there, if I could. Is there more efficiency to be unlocked in your liquid cooling supply chain? Or have you mostly resolved the issues in ramping your production capacity and supply chain there? Charles Liang : We focused on liquid cooling much earlier than the industry, right? So in the last few months, we already shipped more than 2,000 racks, right? And so far, the feedback from customers are very happy. Indeed, that quality, the customer satisfaction even better than our air cooler solution. So we are very excited. Our hard work in the last 3 years that is paying off and we believe liquid cooling will continue to be our major advantage, including the whole data center end-to-end total solutions. Again, not just the liquid cooling racks but kind of deployment, cablings, service management so aware. So we are very excited for our DLC liquid cooling solution and customer like today. Jon Tanwanteng : Great. Thank you and good luck for finding new auditor. Charles Liang : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The following comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. You may proceed. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, sir. Thanks for taking my question. David, from what I understand regarding cash flow, it seems like there was a onetime positive impact your days of inventory went up, but you were able to significantly increase your operating cash flow. Can you -- did I hear you correct? And if so, what is the item that helped you with positive operating cash flow? David Weigand : Sure. I think the answer is, Mehdi, that we've been growing at such a high rate over the past quarters that that's really what's been impacting our operating cash flow is that we've had to pour 100s of million dollars into inventory as well as into accounts receivable. So kind of coming off of a quarter where we didn't have such a dramatic increase in revenue, we were able to generate a lot of cash, basically $1 billion worth of improved cash flows. So it was really -- yes, so it was really just the fact that for the reasons Charles mentioned, the growth wasn't as high. Mehdi Hosseini : I understand, but your DSO went up -- I'm sorry, your days of inventory went up. And I think from what I heard from you, your DSO didn't change. So was that improvement in operating cash flow all driven by working capital reduction or was there something outside of working capital to help you? David Weigand : No, it was really for those reasons. It was really just for inventory equation. Charles Liang : Mehdi, maybe I can have it. I mean, when we grow about 200% more year-over-year. So for sure -- and we see continue to grow. So for sure, we need much higher inventory to support our customer demand. And then when our growth become more normal, not 200% year-over-year. For example, 100% or 80%, then we don't have to grow that much of inventory, and that will help our cash flow. So it's a good challenge I would like to say. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. And then, Charles, maybe you can help us give us an update on your total capacity, especially with the Malaysia expansion? And how should -- how is the utilization of the global installed capacity tracking? Charles Liang : Very good question. We expect we will continue to grow very fast. That's why we have been preparing a huge capacity in Silicon Valley, in Taiwan and now especially in Malaysia. So long term we needed those capacity. But in terms of utilization rate at this moment, I would like to stay a little bit low because capacity is ready, but no such - no enough new chip. As you say that, no in our new chip. That's why variation rate now is relatively low, maybe only 50%. David Weigand : This is Dave. Yes, I was going to give you a couple of other tips on cash flow. You'll probably notice that because of an improved gross margin, we had almost $80 million on a non-GAAP basis, more profit this quarter. In addition to that, again, going back to working capital metrics, we increased our accounts payable by several hundred million dollars. So that -- those are other factors that go into improved operating cash flow. Michael Staiger : Before we go to the next question. Thank you Mehdi. Before going to the next question I just want to clarify one of the comments from earlier with respect to NVIDIA and clarify we have the deepest of relationships with NVIDIA at the technology level. It goes back decades and now we have multiple state-of-the-art projects in progress. And we've spoken to NVIDIA, and they've confirmed there have been no changes to allocations and we maintain a strong relationship and don't expect that to change. So I just wanted to make sure that was clarified. Next question -- actually our last question, Telia. Operator : Absolutely. Our final question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. You may proceed. Quinn Bolton : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the kind of the slightly weaker than expected first half really sounds like, it's just customers waiting for new Blackwell chips. Are you guys seeing that starting to show up in the order books, meaning you're building backlog for either the NVL rack or the Blackwell B200 systems? So you see a nice building backlog for those systems. Obviously, you don't know when you'll get the chips, but that gives you confidence for a much stronger second half once Blackwell starts to ship? Or is it too early for you guys to be actually getting those orders or POs at this point? Charles Liang : Yes. Our solution is very strong. And I believe NVIDIA will continue allocate their solution to the company, the customer who have faced the total solution because at all, common end user satisfaction is mostly important to every company, right? So I would have to say our solution is very strong, and we continue to work with NVIDIA very closely aim to provide the best total solution end-to-end solution to customers. And that's why we started to provide on-site deployment on site cabling -- on-site service. And overall, those new hopefully, very attractive to a lot of new customers and old customers. So we feel very comfortable for the coming to a new chip solution. Quinn Bolton : So the backlog for Blackwell, you're seeing that building on your order books? Charles Liang : We provided kind of remote POC now. And so things are happening. Quinn Bolton : Okay. And second, a follow-up question for David. You've recently sort of filed new credit agreements with both of your banks just setting a date when you would after provide the audited financials. To the extent that you don't hit that date, what happens? Do you just have to go renegotiate new credit agreements? Do the banks at that point, have the right to effectively call those term loans? Just Wondering if you might be able to address what happens with both the bank debt and if there's any risk to the convertible debt, if you don't provide audited financials within the prescribed time. David Weigand : Yes. So I think we'll just refer you to our 8-K filings. We have long-term and good relationships with the banks. And so as necessary, we will file extensions, yes, or get waivers. And like as I mentioned earlier, we're not concerned about the company's ability to access the capital markets. Quinn Bolton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are currently no other questions in queue, so I will now turn it back over to the management team for closing remarks. Michael Staiger : Thank you for joining our conference call today, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
