[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Therese Hayes. Ma'am, you may begin. Therese Hayes : Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 conference call. A copy of today's press releases are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at lululemon.com, or furnished on Form 8-K with the SEC and available on the Commission's website. Shortly after we end this morning, a recording of today's call will be available as a replay for 30 days, also available on the website. Hosting our call today is Laurent Potdevin, the company's CEO; and John Currie, the company's CFO. Our Chief Product Officer, Tara Poseley, will also be available during the Q&A. We would like to remind everyone, of course, that statements contained on this call, which are not historical facts may be deemed or constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We have about 1 hour for today's call. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn it over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. There are obviously a number of things for us to discuss on this call, and a couple of them I'm going to leave to John, namely the share buyback and its future plans. Q1 results were in line with our expectations as sales came in slightly above our guidance, and we are pleased that overall gross margin and earnings were achieved with lower markdowns than last year. We knew, heading into 2014, that driving sales in the first half of the year would be impacted by a suboptimal product assortment, combined with tough traffic trends. Q2 sales have solid arc behind plans and costs are more impacted than we had originally anticipated. In response to this, we have launched a number of initiatives to drive sales and increase long-term guest loyalty. I would like to spend a majority of my time with you focusing on what I believe are the 3 key priorities that will continue to drive Lulemon as a market leader in the future. One, we are continuing to build our product engine to relentlessly innovate and consistently flow new products and exciting products to our stores for both men and women, including having our whitespace workshop and a world-class sourcing organization that are fully integrated with the product development team; two, we are implementing a branding and communication strategy that will create long-term guest loyalty, bring guests back and attract new ones; and three, we are pursuing our international growth with an aggressive yet sustainable plan. So first on product. On our last call, I spoke to preventing quality issues from getting to our guests. We have made significant progress with the product engine and are seeing results with an increasingly higher pass rate at our factories, and a 12% improvement in the past 12 months. As part of our longer term strategy, we are aggressively focused on redesigning our go-to-market calendar to support our global growth. The first phase of this project relating to fact finding and initial assessment is complete. The above process will be fully redesigned and implemented over the next 18 months, and we will see incremental improvement along the way to get back to our long-term growth margin goals of mid-50s. For Q3 and Q4 of this year, we are focused on clarifying roles and responsibilities, freeing up a significant portion of our designers' time so they can focus on what they do best : Being innovative and creating beautiful, technical products. We will implement process and system solutions throughout 2015 to significantly improve the flow of seasonal product to the right store, at the right time and in the right amount. We will start seeing a measurable impact of this work in Q2 of 2015, and we'll continue to gain momentum into the back half of the year. This enhanced predictability will enable us to tell clear brand and product storage in season and across categories. And by Q1 2016, we will have a fully operational, word-class product engine to support a global, omni-channel, multi-brand business with localized assortment capability. All of these efforts will not only result in amazing products, and therefore, increase traffic and consumption, but will play a significant role in getting back to our margin goals. We are very pleased with the momentum of our men's business, which experienced a 9% comp in the quarter, on track with our expectation. And as mentioned on our last call, we look forward to seeing men's dedicated spaces come to life in Vancouver, Santa Monica and Miami in the next couple of months. And our girl's brand, ivivva, continues to perform incredibly well and achieved its highest comp yet in Q1 '14 at 39%. ivivva store and showroom openings are on track for 2014 with 10 and 20 locations, respectively. Next, and as it relates to brand. You're about to see actions that focus on driving traffic and sales. Lululemon can get to the very digital steady guests and have greatly substantial investment to flex all digital muscle through a variety of activations that include : the implementation of a social platform that allows us to leverage the power of our method of community; in-store technology has been rolled out to our entire network of stores to provide our guests the ability to shop our online inventory warning store, which is greatly enhancing the experience by broadening access to products, and we're seeing great results already; additional paid sales, affiliate programs, and on top of these digital projects, we're opening 14 pop-up stores across Canada and the U.S. from April through to September. These stores allow us to target new guests, drive additional sales and showcase the brand in unexpected ways. Last, but not least, our international expansion. I'm really excited about the momentum that we continue to build in what we see as significant opportunity and a long-term growth driver. The success of our first London store opening, which is on track to do $7 million in its first year, is a testament to the international demand for our brand. In other parts of the world, we continue to experience increasing traffic and volume in our showroom. In the past couple of months, we built a very clear 4-year roadmap to increase our overall footprint in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. This will provide continued footprint growth as the North American business matures, and as we reach our anticipated store count of about 350 in North America. By the end of 2014, we will have a presence in 8 countries outside of North America through stores, strategic sales partners and showroom. And when adding eCommerce, the number of countries our product is reaching is 83. We're on track to open our second store in London by year-end, and we expect our first store in Hong Kong by Q1 of 2015. Throughout 2014 and 2015, we are focused on growing our showroom network, with store rollout expected to really ramp up in 2016 and beyond. By the end of 2017, we plan to be present in all major European and Asian regions, with more than 20 stores in both Europe and Asia. 2014 is very much a transitional year for Lululemon, and we are on track with the improvements we are set to achieve. We are focused on building a scalable foundation to further elevate our North American business and foresee the brand's incredible international potential. I am confident that the work we're doing today will only enhance our premium positioning, as we continue to lead the market as the market innovator. And now I will like to turn the call over to John. John Currie : Thanks, Laurent. Before I review the details of our first quarter of 2014 and update you on our outlook for the year, I want to begin by talking about the share repurchase program that we announced this morning. The Board has approved a program to buy back up to $450 million of our common shares, that's dollars, of course, at prevailing market prices over the next 2 years. To fund this plan, we will repatriate cash from our Canadian subsidiary to our U.S. parent company, which will trigger a onetime tax charge of $30.9 million, taken on earnings from prior years that were previously not subject to U.S. tax. This nonrecurring tax expense is recorded in our first quarter results and represents a $0.21 impact on our diluted earnings per share. This now increases our available cash in the U.S., allowing us the flexibility to distribute capital back to our shareholders. We believe in the long-term value of the company, and this program will serve to create shareholder value as we execute it over time. Now on to our first quarter results. For Q1, total net revenue rose 11.2% to $384.6 million from $345.8 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase in revenue is driven by total comparable sales growth on a combined basis, including e-Commerce of 1% on a constant dollar basis, comprised of 25% growth online and a bricks-and-mortar stores sales decline of 4%, all on a constant dollar basis; the additional 45 net new corporate-owned stores since Q1 of 2013, 30 net new stores in the U.S.; 2 stores in Canada; 2 stores in Australia; 2 in New Zealand; 1 in the U.K.; and 8 ivivva stores; and offset with the foreign exchange impact of a lower Canadian and Australian dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $10.1 million or 2.6%. During the quarter, we opened 9 corporate- owned stores : 3 Lululemon stores in the U.S., 1 in Australia and our first store in the U.K., as well as 4 ivivva stores in the U.S. We ended the quarter with 263 total stores versus 218 1 year ago. There are now 202 stores in our comp base, 39 of those in Canada, 131 in the U.S., 24 in Australia and New Zealand and 8 ivivva. We also opened another 2 international showrooms during the quarter, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in China, for a total of 7 in Asia and 9 in Europe at the end of Q1. We now operate a total of 76 showrooms, which also include 18 ivivva locations. Corporate-owned stores represented 74.9% of total revenue or $288.1 million, versus 77.9% or $269.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $66 million or 17.2% of total revenue versus $54 million or 15.6% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes wholesale, showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets, totaled $30.5 million or 7.9% of revenue for the first quarter, versus $22.5 million or 6.5% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. Gross profit for the first quarter was $195.7 million or 50.9% of net revenue, compared to $170.7 million or 49.4% of net revenue in Q1 2013. The factors which contributed to this 150 basis point increase in gross margin were : the 510 basis point improvement in gross margin, due to anniversary in the Luon write-off provision from last year; a decrease in markdowns and discounts of 110 basis points, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. And these were offset with product margin decline of 310 basis points due primarily to a higher sales mix of lower margin seasonal items, and also in part attributable to higher raw material costs associated with prints and textured garments, as well as duty adjustments that were trued up this quarter; 50 basis points deleverage from the foreign exchange impact of -- on product costs due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar; higher airfreight costs of 40 basis points; and 70 basis points deleverage from continued investment in our product and supply chain functions. SG&A expenses were $125.9 million or 32.7% of net revenue, compared with $104.8 million or 30.3% of net revenue in the same period of last year. The 20.1% SG&A dollar increase is due to an increase in operating expenses associated with new stores, showrooms and outlets, as well as higher wages across our stores to reflect merit increases and base pay market adjustments; increased variable operating costs associated with our e-Commerce business, consistent with the year-over-year revenue growth in this channel; increases in expenses at our Store's Support Centre, including salaries, administrative expenses, professional fees and management incentive compensation, associated with the growth in our business. And in addition, we recognized $1.5 million in foreign exchange losses, which added to overall SG&A. And these were offset with a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which decreased reported SG&A by $5.4 million or 4.3%. As a percent of revenue, our first quarter SG&A deleveraged 240 basis points due primarily to the run rate of prior year investments and new incremental operating expense needed to drive long-term growth. As a result, operating income for the first quarter was $69.8 million or 18.2% of net revenue, compared with $65.9 million or 19.1% of net revenue in Q1 2013. Tax expense for the quarter was $52.5 million. This includes the onetime adjustment of $30.9 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings to fund the share buyback program. Excluding this tax adjustment, the tax rate would have been 30.1%, compared to 29.8% in the first quarter of 2013. Net income for the quarter was $19 million or $0.13 per diluted share. On a normalized basis, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.34, compared to net income of $47.3 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2013. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 145.9 million versus 145.8 million 1 year ago. Capital expenditures were $25.4 million for the quarter, compared to $21 million in the first quarter of last year, with the increase associated with new stores, renovations, IT and head office capital. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $752 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the year -- sorry, end of the first quarter was $177.4 million or 23.4% higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Similar to the last quarter, this is higher than optimal, due primarily to a higher composition of core inventory. We expect to continue to rebalance our inventory levels as we head into the back half of the year, and have adjusted our assortment more in line with guest demands for fall and winter. This now leads me to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year of 2014. May performance to date has been soft, as our comps have declined from the first quarter. As a result of our comp trends, we have deployed revenue-driving initiatives for both our stores and e-commerce site, some of which Laurent addressed earlier. In addition, we've opened pop-up locations to capture demand in areas that otherwise would not have a store. While these initiatives are good for the long term, as they primarily encompass full price selling, they do come with increased SG&A costs. We expect these initiatives to mitigate some the sales mix over the rest of 2014. As a result, we're adjusting our Q2 and full year revenue and SG&A forecast for these changes. We currently anticipate Q2 revenue in the range of $375 million to $380 million. This is based on comparable sales percentage decrease in the low- to mid single-digits on a constant dollar basis, compared to the second quarter of 2013. This outlook assumes a Canadian dollar at $0.91 with the U.S. dollar, and 12 new store openings : 7 in the U.S.; 2 in Australia and New Zealand; and 3, ivivva. Consistent with Q1, we expect gross margin to be between 50% and 51%. This is down from 1 year ago, primarily due to a higher mix of lower marginal seasonal product, deleveraged against product and supply chain expenses within cost of goods sold, store occupancy and depreciation; and lastly, the impact of foreign exchange due to a weaker Canadian dollar compared to last year. We expect SG&A to deleverage as a percent of revenue compared to the second quarter of 2013, which is driven primarily from the run rate of strategic investments made last year, and incremental spend in traffic in revenue-driving initiatives. While these investments to drive the top line, the associated sales carry a reduced flow-through percentage. Finally, due to a slightly stronger Canadian dollar relative to the end of Q1, we will incur foreign exchange losses that will increase SG&A. Our SG&A also reflects preopening costs related to the 12 stores planned to open in Q2 and additional stores planned to open in early Q3 of 2014. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 146 million diluted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 per share. For the full fiscal year 2014, we expect net revenue for the year to be in the low to mid of our previous guidance at $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion. We expect to open 45 corporate-owned stores, including our Australian stores and the ivivva locations. We're also on pace to operate up to 20 international showrooms by the end of this year. For the year, we expect gross margin of approximately 51%, down from last year, due primarily to product mix, continued investment in our supply chain and product operations functions, and also foreign exchange impacts from a weaker Canadian dollar. We are on track to open our second U.S. distribution center in Columbus, Ohio in August, which will go live initially with e-Commerce, with retail fulfillment to begin in Q1 of 2015. As I mentioned before, the startup costs and increased capacity will initially delever our gross margin by 30 to 40 basis points in 2014. We expect SG&A deleverage as a percent of revenue compared to 2013. This primarily includes investment in corporate SG&A in areas such as brand, IT, guest experience and international that were included in our original guidance for the year. The traffic and sales initiatives discussed earlier will result in an incremental investment in the $10 million range. In addition, our SG&A forecast is also setting aside funds for additional strategies currently being developed and evaluated for approval. As a result, we expect our overall operating margin to delever from 2013 and our fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.50 to $1.55, or $1.71 to $1.76, normalized for the tax adjustment. This is based on 146.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding as our guidance does not reflect any estimate of shares repurchased, and it assumes an overall effective tax rate of 38.6%, which includes the onetime tax adjustment, or 30.2%, excluding this tax adjustment. We expect capital expenditures to be between $110 million and $115 million for fiscal 2014, reflecting new store buildouts, renovation capital for existing stores, IT and other head office capital, including expansion of our existing premises. And finally, before we open up the call to questions, I want to take a minute to speak to the announcement today that I will retire at the end of the fiscal year, once we transition to my successor. As many of you know, we are a very goal-oriented company, and it's been -- long been a part of my goal to expand my involvement, serving on corporate and nonprofit boards. And for those of you who know me really well, you know that my long-standing goal has been to ski each season the number of days equal to my age. Since I turn 60 next year and these goals are difficult to achieve with a day job, I've decided that this is the time to announce my retirement plans. This will allow the company to initiate a comprehensive search for my replacement and to allow for a smooth transition. So this isn't the time to say goodbye as I'll be around for a number of months, and you'll have me to kick around on at least a couple of more earnings calls. And so with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Drbul of Nomura. Robert Drbul : John, best of luck and congratulations on the retirement. Laurent, I guess the first question that I have really is, with John retiring, should we expect additional management changes, now that you've had some further time to sort of assimilate into the organization and create a little bit more of a view? Laurent Potdevin : Well, first off, I mean, we're all incredibly sad to see John deciding to go and start his professional skiing career. But we've got a number of months with him before that happens. And with every transition, you do have changes, and we have a couple of other changes, including one change in brand, in our Brand and communications department. Robert Drbul : Okay, great. And then within the new -- within the updated outlook, on the gross margin side and even on the sales side, can you just update us around like the expectations for the seasonal offerings and the Fast Turn capsules, related to both top line and the gross margin? Therese Hayes : So I'll speak to Fast Turn and, John, if you want to field the gross margin questions. But I think we've talked a lot about 2014 being the year of building our foundation. And we've been doing a lot of work for the back half of the year to rebalance the assortments between the seasonal core, really reflecting where the guests' appetite is for seasonal core. Also we have used our fast turn group to chase into additional prints and bottoms for the third quarter. And then as we move into fourth quarter, we continue to use that team to chase into product, as well as we've worked really diligently to make sure more of the beauty and technical is that, I've you spoken to in prior calls and then on the Analyst Day, but making sure we are more consistently showing up with that in our product. John Currie : And on your gross margin question, as long as I'm getting it right, I think in our gross margin will be pretty consistent with where it was in Q1 through the first 3 quarters. And then, of course, in the fourth quarter, due to higher volumes, it'll be a couple of basis -- or a couple of hundred basis points higher. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan. Brian Tunick : I was hoping maybe you could just parse out the quarter-to-date deceleration in the comp trend. How much of that is a traffic issue? And how much of that may be the product flow issue? And then maybe just some more commentary on the pop-up stores. Maybe what's the duration of the leases? And could those potentially become permanent stores as well? John Currie : Okay. It's hard to dissect the comp only a few weeks into the quarter. But actually, what we're seeing is traffic a little bit stronger, which is very encouraging, but conversion down, which makes sense with a non-ideal product assortment. So it means -- it's telling us that we're maintaining the guests coming in. And when the product is right, that should deliver a rebound, but in the back half. And in on the pop-up stores, I think your question would these be the permanent? They're typically leases of less than 6 months, and unlikely that any of these will be permanent stores. There might be some locations where we would seek out a permanent store, but not in these existing locations. Operator : Our next question is from Roxanne Meyer of UBS. Roxanne Meyer : I was wondering if you could talk longer term about the gross margin and your targets to get back to the mid-50s. I just -- I guess, just thinking about the perspective, back when your margins were more healthily steadily there, your comps were at a much more elevated level. And obviously, your mix shift was a bit -- your mix was a bit different, more skewed to the higher margin core product. And obviously that's transitioning and weighing down on your margin now. So what are the factors that you think longer-term can get your gross margin back to the mid-50s? John Currie : Okay. Tara, maybe I'll take it and you can add whatever you'd like. When I look at our longer-term gross margin where I see tremendous opportunity to get back to that mid-50s range, it comes from all the work that Tara and Jennifer Battersby and their teams are doing to change the go-to-market process to operate more efficiently and just work with our factory partners in a more organized, disciplined way. We see that potentially driving 300 to 500 basis points of improvement over time. That'll take a couple of years to get there, but there's a pretty clear roadmap that we're seeing that should deliver that. Tara, anything to add? Tara Poseley : No. I think unless there's additional questions. Operator : Our next question is from Barbara Wyckoff of CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff : Congrats to John. I'm going to talk about -- ask about gross margin, too. You mentioned lower margin on seasonal product, is that because you're intentionally taking a lower IMU, because the costs are higher, due to smaller quantities? Are there higher markdowns, air shipping? And at what point do you think that IMU or that margin comes up? John Currie : Yes. I'd say -- I mean, generally, it is higher cost, whether it's textures and prints or additional features that in our pricing architecture, we haven't taken full pricing. And so they do tend to have a lower margin. I think Tara's commented in the past that, potentially, over time, we look at that pricing architecture. But for the near-term, that's really what's driving the larger or the lower margin on the seasonal items. Operator : Our next question is from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock : I was wondering if you could focus more on the revenue-driving initiatives. I understand the pop-up stores, but could you talk about what you're doing specifically for what would impact the comp base? Like what type of revenue-driving initiatives would impact either your e-Commerce business or the stores and the comp base? Laurent Potdevin : Sure. Yes. We -- I mean, Lululemon engages a very digitally savvy guests, and we really haven't flexed our muscle there. And we're doing a number of things. I mean we are doing -- I spoke on our earlier call, on our call from a quarter ago about the incredible value of our ambassadors and the fact we don't really fully leverage the stories that happen in our communities. So we're building a social platform that is unique to our ambassadors that will go live in September, so that we can gather, real-time, all of the work that's happening in our communities and sort of be able to share that in a much more efficient way. We're also -- we released in-store technology so that we can share inventories when our guests are in store, they can actually shop online inventory, therefore, sort of enhancing the access to product. And then we have really ramped up page search media with leveraging sort of standard channels through Google. We're working on click to breaks and this is a geo-based strategy that we're doing in partnership with Google as well. And we're also accelerating our affiliate partnerships with ambassadors, studio, elite athletes who promote our content and drive traffic to our site. To add to that, I mean, we've been really successful with our product notifications, and we're planning to double the base of guests that receive those product notification, and we're also going to make them a lot better and a lot more efficient. And finally, as we start up, as we ramp-up our CRM efforts, I mean, we're planning to do some light segmentation of our emails to be much more targeted in how we reach our guests. Operator : Our next question is from John Morris of BMO Capital Markets. John Morris : Two-part questions here. First of all, I think in the prepared remarks, Laurent, you talked about ramping up store openings. I think it was in 2016 and beyond, and wondering what does that long-term square footage growth look like? If you look out 3 to 5 years, do you have kind of a target for that? And also with respect to the long-term operating margin goals, what would those look like, given what you've already been talking about with respect to the long-term gross margin goals? Laurent Potdevin : So as we think about our international expansion, we're staying very true to our showroom strategy, which is to build awareness in the market and build momentum, and so -- and getting pulled by the community. And we expect the showroom to have a lifespan of 12 to 18 months before we're ready for store rollout. So we're going to be, in the next 18 to 24 months, we're going to really accelerate the showrooms internationally. And then that's going to trigger a store rollout 12 to 18 months following that. So the plan is really to be -- and if you think by 2017 having over 20 stores in Europe, 20 stores in Asia, not including, what I mentioned Asia, not including Australia and New Zealand. The plan is further and beyond to be able to open probably about the same number of stores that we're currently opening today in North America, around 45, and that will sort of replace the square footage opening in the next couple of years in North America as that market matures. John Morris : So would that be kind of a mid-teen? Or maybe even a target towards 20% long-term square footage growth? Just want to kind of get a feel for that. John Currie : We just have to do the arithmetic. I mean, we tend to think in units. These stores are each about 3,000... Laurent Potdevin : Yes, it's probably just under mid-teens, right? Yes. John Currie : Yes. John Morris : And, John, operating margin? John Currie : We said -- highly confident that the gross margin will get back to that mid-50s range. As I said in the past, getting back to mid-20s operating margin, I think, we'll get there. Of course, as we are expanding into new countries, new markets, initial productivity will be lower, so that will bring down operating margin temporarily as those stores ramp up. But the core business and as international operations mature, my view hasn't changed on our ability to achieve that mid-20s operating margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I was hoping, I think, Laurent, you mentioned there might be some other changes in management. So could you give us an update on where you're seeking talent? What holes are still out there where we might see more turnover? And then maybe a broader comment on just morale within the organization, given kind of the disruption both in management, but also, more recently, with the Board? Laurent Potdevin : Sure. So on the morale, I mean, I think we're not commenting on the Board. But meeting with the company yesterday, we've sort of mentioned that our parents are fighting, and it's awkward. But both Chief and the rest of the boards fully support the management team and what we're doing. So we are staying focused and we're not going to let us be distracted. And so I think we're in very good shape there. I mean, when you think about our educators, I mean, they are the face of the brand, and they deal with our guests every day. So certainly, we've made up their lives more difficult in the past years, but we're very focused on them being engaged, excited and happy. So we haven't seen any increased turnover there. And I don't remember the first part of your question. Sharon Zackfia : I think in response to a previous question, you had mentioned there might be similar changes in management. So could you give us any update on that? I think you said maybe somebody in product or something like that? And then if there are any keyholes you're still looking to fill within the management team? Laurent Potdevin : Yes. When I came on board, we had a hole in HR, and we're in the very final stages of that search. I'm really excited about that. And we're also, Laura Klauberg and Brian [ph] in Marketing has decided to move on, and we're in the process of interviewing candidates there. But we have a really, really strong team, both on the community, brand, digital and creative side of the business, and we've gotten very engaged with them. And other than that, we're in great shape. Operator : Our next question is from Adrienne Tennant of Janney Capital Markets. Adrienne Tennant : My question actually is on the non-comp productivity. It looks weak again. For the fourth quarter at the Analyst Day, you had delineated several factors that were contributing to fourth quarter non-comp productivity. Could you do the same for the first quarter? And then secondarily, Laurent, have you done any brand awareness studies for the Canadian and U.S. market? And then the new markets that you're entering? John Currie : Okay. Sorry, I can't remember how I delineated the new store products. Adrienne Tennant : You gave us a Top 10. The reason -- the Top 10 things we were missing in our non-comp calculations. John Currie : Yes. That's okay. Got you. Yes, you're probably still making most of those mistakes. So bottom, bottom line, again, when we look at new store productivity in Q1, it continued to be in that $1,100 to $1,200 per square foot range, similar to what we've seen over the last 18 months. Adrienne Tennant : So no change, no meaningful change there? Okay. John Currie : No, no. Laurent Potdevin : And as far as looking at consumer sentiment, brand strengths, we actually just launched -- we implemented NPS, Net Promoter Score. And we got our first benchmarks yesterday. So I haven't had a chance to fully dig into them, but I'm really looking forward to using that as a tool to sort of see how well our brand initiatives are changing the brand sentiments and improving conversion and traffic. Adrienne Tennant : Does that study give you brand awareness at the end? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, it does. Adrienne Tennant : And will you share that with us on the next call, perhaps? Laurent Potdevin : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Janet Kloppenburg of JJK Research. Janet Kloppenburg : I have a couple of questions. I wondered if Laurent or Tara may -- might talk a little bit more specifically about the sales slowdown in May. Has it been in both -- all categories, men's and women's, and across all subcategories of bottoms and tops? And what it looks like by channel? And if you could maybe help me understand a little bit more, Tara, I thought that the fashion component was to become higher here in the second quarter, and then that would help drive sales and traffic and conversion in the stores. It seems like things are going in reverse, and I'm not sure I really understand why. Has the build to the fashion assortment not been what you expected it to be here in the second quarter? Tara Poseley : Janet, Tara here. So just -- I've been pretty consistently saying in 9 -- when I came into the business and knowing our product life cycle, it's a 9 months calendar. I've been pretty consistent that I was getting that rebalance of core and seasonal corrected for the third quarter, not the second quarter. And then also I've been chasing into prints and really continuing to work on the reinvention of core. And we'll start to see more of that in bottoms, as we get into Q3. And then Q4, my focus not only with the rebalance, but also making sure -- working closely with design to really try to affect the beauty technical piece that's so important to our brand, and it really sets the foundation of who Lululemon is. So for second quarter, I mean, those assortments were done well over 1 year ago prior to me getting here. But we've used the Fast Turn team pretty aggressively to affect third and fourth quarter. Laurent Potdevin : And to add to Tara's point. One, I mean I've been incredibly impressed with how quickly the team is reacting on the fly and getting us the absolute best assortment they can, in an environment where we don't have -- we haven't planned for that 1 year ago. But also, if you look at the beginning of Q2 and going back to the point that John made earlier, I mean, once we're seeing traffic getting stronger, which speaks to the brand sentiment getting better and conversion getting lower. So the initiatives that we've started to do about brand are paying off. Operator : Our next question is from Jennifer Black of Jennifer Black & Associates. Jennifer Black : I was wondering if you could talk about your efforts to acquire data about your core customer and his or her shopping preferences. Are you able to track how many customers and transactions are tied to purchases? And if not, what systems do you have in place that will be able to give you detailed information? Or is this something that you're working on building? Is this part of a bigger picture down the road, building your CRM loyalty program? Laurent Potdevin : We've actually never used a lot of data in the history of Lululemon, and we're shifting that as quickly as possible. I mean, we've got a very loyal guest and we should know a lot more about him or her, and it is part of our CRM efforts. So we are investing heavily, both from a talent standpoint and from a technology standpoint to really ramp that up. And it's a little bit of a curse than a blessing, the curse being that we don't have a lot of data right now, the blessing being that we can build a system that will really sort of take us in the future, and that's what we're building. So it is part of the plan, and we're in the process of building it. Operator : Our next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory. Dana Telsey : As you work to drive traffic and improve the assortments, is anything changing on the pricing side, both with core and with seasonal product? And are you seeing the same trends online as to what you're seeing in the stores? And lastly, any further update on London. How that is doing? And just one more quick thing, on the sourcing side, Jennifer and Tara, how are you doing in putting in place the processes that you want? Where are you in getting to the end goal? Tara Poseley : Okay. I'll start. And just on the process and sourcing side, one of the things, as I've been here since November and really on the ground in Vancouver starting in February, one of the things that I have found in really digging into our go-to-market calendar with Jennifer is, we have a go-to-market calendar that really supports a much smaller company and doesn't necessarily reflect the complexity of where we are today and where we're going in the future. So work that we have done and put underway, we brought in outside consultants, who I've actually worked with in the past, to do a deep dive on our go-to-market calendar. And over the next 6, 12 and 18 months, we are going to be implementing the findings that we found, as we really looked in and did the deep dive on the calendar. So I think, from a quality standpoint, Laurent has talked about it, all the process, procedure is in place for quality. And now our real focus is on the go-to-market calendar and creating a really efficient, strong calendar that supports an innovative product organization. So as we move into Q3 and Q4, I've talked a great deal about on this year, it's just really about building our foundation. So we're going to be beginning to shift our process as we move into Q3 and Q4, which we'll really start seeing the result as we move into Q2 of 2016 and beyond. And then the core versus the seasonal product and pricing structure, one of the things we've initiated is a very strategic work around pricing, where we sit in the market place and our pricing architecture. And as I see opportunities, both in the core and in the seasonal to adjust pricing, through that very methodical approach, we'll be doing so. So then I'll just turn it over, because I think there might have been another question about driving traffic. Dana Telsey : Exactly. Laurent Potdevin : The question was about driving traffic in London, right? So London, I mentioned that earlier, I mean, London is performing incredibly well. I mean, I think we're in excess of 130% of plan. And we're sort of on track to be a $7 million store in Year 1, which we're very pleased with. And in terms of driving traffic, I mean, I'll go back to what I said earlier about flexing our digital muscles and we're also working on some key initiatives at the store level that we'll be rolling out in the next couple of months. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Lejuez of Wells Fargo. Tracy Kogan : It's Tracy filling in for Paul. Question for John. I was wondering of your $110 million to $115 million of CapEx this year, how much of that is going to IT and infrastructure versus new stores? And then as you look out to future years, do you think the CapEx number continues to pick up? Or do you think it will flatten out at this level? John Currie : Okay. I think all of the various IT systems and initiatives are probably close to $40 million of that number. There's, what, 10 , 15 of various head office-related capital. And the balance is either new store build-out or -- we have a pretty significant renovation program every year. I think you'll see CapEx in a similar range for a couple of years and maybe beyond. But it's certainly on the store side, and with systems once you get them all implemented, it's time to upgrade them. So probably that's sort of level is a good number for several years. Laurent Potdevin : And some of them focus on guest taking technology, right? Either in-store technology that's we're planning to play with, or our CRM in business, our guest intelligence effort. Operator : Our next question is from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Camilo Lyon : I wanted to just understand a little bit more, I mean, you talked about some of these revenue-driving initiatives. You talked favorably about what you are seeing on the traffic side. But just help me understand exactly why you see the level of re-acceleration in comp growth in the second half, given that there's still some imbalances between seasonal and core and the efficiencies on the supply-chain side look more like of a longer-term sort of benefit and not something just completely see in the back half. So if you could just help reconcile that, that would be great. John Currie : Yes, I think, a couple of things gave us confidence that you're going to see stronger comps in the second half. First of all, as Tara said, the product assortment won't be ideal in the second half, but it'll be improved over what we saw in Q1 and what we're dealing within Q2. And then secondly, the downturn in traffic and some of the issues started really in Q3, Q4 last year. So we're going to be lapping weaker performance in the second half of 2013 versus what we saw at the start of the year. Camilo Lyon : And then just on competition, how are you thinking about the competitive environment now? Whether it's from skewed overlap, pricing dynamics? And then just lastly, if you could just break up the Canadian to U.S. comps? Laurent Potdevin : You want to break down the comps and... John Currie : Yes -- sorry, I just got to find it. Yes, U.S. combined comps was 2%, and the U.S. is minus 5%. Sorry, Canada was minus 5%. Laurent Potdevin : And as far as competition, I mean, obviously, it's a crowded field, but it's also a very much of a growing field globally, and we know that we've got the right talent. And when we -- these are in the product as we've done lately, I mean, we win. So we're in this game to win it and maintain our premium position in the market that we've created. Operator : Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Citi. Oliver Chen : On your full year comp guidance, what's the implication for fourth quarter? It seems like as you rebalance, you'll potentially see an acceleration. So are you thinking mid-to-high by fourth quarter and third quarter? Can we assume that, that's going to inflect the positive comps? Also, if you could just comment on your inventory composition? And how you feel about freshness now? It was running ahead, and you tapered your guidance down. So I was curious about if there's merchandise margin pressure? And if things are over inventoried currently? John Currie : Yes. In the second half, we see Q3 turning to positive combined comps. And you're right, sort of mid to -- maybe mid to -- a little bit above comps in Q4. In terms of inventory composition, similar to last quarter, where -- as I said on the -- in the prepared remarks, we're a little heavier than we'd like to be overall in inventory, but the excess is primarily excess core. And we deal with that just by reducing forward orders, which we have done it. And that excess of core is actually coming down. So we feel pretty good about the freshness of the balance of the inventory. Then in general, we're doing things like opening these pop-up stores. So that even with weaker than we'd like to see sales trends, we're able to clear this inventory at full price. Oliver Chen : Just a follow-up on the conversion rates, where you -- it seems like there's an opportunity for a better conversion rate. Which classifications between, like, tops and bottoms, do you feel that she may be looking at but not purchasing, or has an opportunity for the most improvement? Tara Poseley : Well, I think that we have been talking about the core that we have an opportunity to evolve our core, as we move forward. So I would say the first place that we'll start seeing the results first would be in the bottoms and then tops and jackets really following in subsequent quarters. Did that answer your question, Oliver? I'm not sure. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Jim Duffy : A couple of questions, so bear with me on this. The first one, have you implemented any of these initiatives to drive traffic yet? And if so, have you seen a noticeable influence in the results? Then I have a follow-up related to that. Laurent Potdevin : Yes, we have. We've just launched. And it's early to tell what the results will be, but we've done the affiliate programs, the paid search and the Google clicks to break. And the one initiative that we can speak to is the in-store technology that gives our guest access to our online inventory while in stores, and we've seen tremendous results with that, with the app already generating 1% of our retail sales and 8% of e-Comm sales -- and 4% -- I'm sorry, and 4% of our e-Comm sales. I was a little optimistic with that... Jim Duffy : Does that get credited to the e-Commerce business or to the retail stores? Laurent Potdevin : It gets credited to the e-Commerce business, but the store manager gets compensated for the sale. Jim Duffy : Very good. So my next question is, so traffic's getting better. You feel -- you have these initiatives, which you expect to drive more traffic, you expect better product in the stores for 3Q, and it sounds like even better yet for 4Q. Can you be more specific about the things you are seeing that gives you a reason to be more conservative on the revenue outlook for the full year? John Currie : I mean, even though we're seeing -- we're more comfortable with traffic and we still are seeing a deceleration in comps coming into Q2, and that's reflected in my guidance. And so as we extrapolate out, we are taking into account the positives in terms of product assortment, et cetera. But I think it's still prudent to be conservative and expect that the underlying trend continues for the time being. Operator : Our next question is from Howard Tubin of RBC Capital Markets. Howard Tubin : Tara, maybe you could just comment a little bit on the men's business? I think, you said it was up 9% in the quarter. So what's so are you finding about that? What's driving the men's business? Tara Poseley : So we're really pleased with the men's business. Q1, our big focus was on really landing our men's fit, which we are pleased to have done, as well as really focus on the base of our sweat assortment. So we've been pleased with the results there. So I think the men's team, this is their first quarter of our nearly formed men's team with Felix del Toro. And we're excited about the momentum that I'm continuing to see in the product that's going forward in Q2 and Q3 and moving into Q4. I don't like giving specifics on exactly what is doing well in the assortment, because that's just nice information I would just be handing out to competition. But we're very pleased with the results and where we see that business going, as well as when we talked about the Ivivva business, and I think the product there looks tremendous and very excited for the team and also the momentum there gaining in their business as well. Laurent Potdevin : And if you look on the digital side, what we've done with the men's business, they've just launched a very specific social platform. They've got a different sort of shopping environment. So we've done some really great work, and you can really sort of experience that firsthand on our website. Howard Tubin : Got it. Can you remind us what percentage of the overall business is men's? Laurent Potdevin : 13%, 14%? John Currie : 13% in the quarter. A little over 13%. Tara Poseley : Operator, we have time for just one more question. Operator : Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : John, I wanted to check the cash balance on the balance sheet, $750 million. How much of that is in the U.S.? John Currie : A little over $100 million. Most of it's in Canada. Kimberly Greenberger : The $31 million onetime tax adjustment. How much will that charge? How much of the cash that's outside of the United States, will that charge allow you to repatriate? John Currie : $500 million. Kimberly Greenberger : $500 million? Okay. John Currie : That's how we did the calculation. Kimberly Greenberger : And then my question for Tara is, if there are -- and I apologize for asking such a basic question, but is there a simple way to help us understand what you think is wrong with the assortment currently? I'm not -- I've been listening through the Q&A and trying to understand this a little better. But I'm not sure I get it. Tara Poseley : That's okay. So what we've been, and we talked about it on the last call, is we have a core product assortment that has not been evolved as quickly as it should have been. And we're diligently working away at that. We didn't have enough depth in our seasonal product in Q1. We're very -- our balance is more heavily weighted towards core and less on the seasonal. So we're getting that rebalanced back in line. And it will be running more where it was running in 2012, by the time we get back into Q3 and Q4. I think there's been a real lack of cohesive merchandising stories in our store, really telling those product stories in a really clear and concise way. So lots of opportunity there, especially as we move into '16. And then, again, I talked about the go-to-market calendar. We have a lot of opportunity to evolve that process to really express where we are as a more complex North American brand and moving forward, as a global brand. So a lot of work being done there. That will bring a lot more consistency as we move into '16 in our product storytelling and our beautiful technical product landing in stores on time, in right place at the right time as we talked about. Laurent Potdevin : All right. So thank you very much. It was good speaking to you all. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Chris Tham : Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2014 conference call. A copy of today's press release is available on the Investors section of lululemon's website at www.lululemon.com or furnished on Form of 8-K with the SEC and available on the Commission's website at sec.gov. Shortly after we end this morning, a recording of today's call will be available as a replay for 30 days on the Investors section of the website.  Hosting our call today is Laurent Potdevin, the company's CEO; John Currie, the company's CFO; and Tara Poseley, our Chief Product Officer, will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.  We would like to remind everybody that statements contained on this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. For today's call, we have a limit of 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn it over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Good morning, everyone. The results we're sharing with you today are beginning to reflect the ongoing work that is being done across our entire organization, and our sales and bottom line for the quarter finished slightly ahead of plan. We are early in the process of getting back to consistently delivering amazing and innovative products to our guests, along with unmatched guest experiences. We obviously don't aspire to flat same-store sales and earnings that are down year-over-year and yet are confident that the work and investments we're making is building the foundation that will fully unlock lululemon's long-term global potential. On our last call, I laid out 4 key priorities, product, brand, guest experience and international expansion, and our second quarter results indicate consistent progress against those priorities. On the product front, product flows were a dictating force in our sales trend in the second quarter. This was particularly evident in July as we chased into additional prints and bottoms and leveraged our Fast Turn team to create mesh products, which brought newness and excitement in-stores and online. Additionally, our transitional collection, which was a new strategy to bridge summer and fall, was incredibly well received by our guests and created the upside we saw in July by selling through faster than anticipated. While our assortment are not optimal this year, we have started to shift our mix with further improvement expected in 2015. We've also emphasized our commitment to building our foundation over the next 18 months in order to set ourselves up for global growth. One of these foundational areas to strengthen is our go-to-market process. And although it's still early, we are hitting each milestone in the implementation of the calendar that we set to achieve. At this time, we've completed the cadence of the calendar, resulting in 4 additional weeks of creative space for our designers as they start to design for 2015. This past quarter, our Whitespace workshop has started partnering with our ambassadors on 3 different fronts : first, co-creating innovative, technical and beautiful products with a small group of elite ambassadors; second, gaining a deep insight into the athlete-product relationship; and third, testing and validating product development in upcoming launches. The information we derived from our workshop project, combined with a world-class product engine, will drive the innovation that our guests love. Moving on to brand and guest experience. On our last call, I spoke about one of our most unique, yet underleveraged assets, our 1,500 strong army of ambassadors. These athletes are leaders in their communities, they embody our lifestyle and reflect our amazing culture in everything that they do. They are the authentic voices in our communities whose local stories and insights are shifting our global brands and we are committed to building and nurturing this group of inspirational athletes. One of the ways we're harnessing the collective power of this group is through the Online Ambassador Forum we recently launched. Through this forum, more than 1,000 of our ambassadors are connecting and sharing feedback with each other, the lululemon stores and the product and Whitespace teams here in Vancouver. Our SeaWheeze Half Marathon in Vancouver, which  brings together running, yoga and community was once again a tremendous and inspiring success and we are thrilled to see our annual event become such a sought-after destination. We hosted more than 10,000 runners, 70% of whom were from outside of Vancouver and 50% from outside of Canada. In fact, registration for 2015 took place yesterday and sold out in 36 minutes. This event truly embodies the spirit of lululemon and we're rolling out locally relevant experiences in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Toronto from October through December that will reflect that same spirit. This year, the SeaWheeze event took place on the hills of the opening of our flagship Robson store in Vancouver, a beautiful 4,500-square foot space featuring in-store digital storytelling, dedicated space for men's and women's and on-site product personalization. This new space serves as an example of the directions we are taking with similar openings scheduled to take place in Miami and Santa Monica in the next quarter. The store opening was supported with community events that truly showcase the engagement that currently exists among our guests. The store performance in its opening week performed at 141% to plan, which was the highest volume store globally, reaching an 18% penetration in men's sales, the highest in North America. To further elevate our guest experience and global brand awareness, we are relocating our SoHo store in New York and opening both men's and women's stand-alone locations kitty-corner to each other on Prince and Wooster with the men's location opening by late fall 2014. This will provide unique experiences for both men and women in spaces that are designed uniquely for their needs. I look forward to seeing how these 2 stores build a steady partnership while still making sure to one up each other every now and then. Once again, the ivivva business performed very well with a positive comp of 36% this quarter. We recently launched our Dreams & Goals program for all our stores and showrooms to connect with our young guests and we're incredibly excited about the potential of this growing brand. And we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our goal. We made significant headwinds in improving our online guest experience by opening another distribution center to improve the service level to our guests by delivering products faster. This distribution center is located in Columbus, Ohio. Our new guest order management system went live on July 11. This is a major pillar in our 1-guest omni-channel strategy, enabling efficient routing of orders among all distribution centers. And this quarter, our bag backroom app, which allows us to process sales in-store from our online inventory, created incremental opportunities and enhanced the experience for our guests by giving them access to a broader product selection. Moving on to our international expansion. We are seeing continued demand in brand strength globally with our London store continuing to perform strongly, and we look forward to opening our second store in Chelsea by December 2014. We are on track to build a network of showrooms in both Europe and Asia through 2014 and 2015, and by the end of 2017, to have 20 stores in both regions. And we are very  happy to announce that we've secured a fantastic location in Singapore in the ION mall and are on track for a Q4 opening. We're also in the final stages of securing our first location in Hong Kong scheduled to open early 2015. On the heels of the successful opening in London in the spring and a continuation of strong demand and performance, we continue to look into opportunities to accelerate market entry in other regions, including being in discussions with a potential partner in the Middle East to enter the region by Q4 2015.  Before I turn the call over to John, I want to mention that we're all looking forward to having Advent back as a shareholder. Advent was an early investor in lululemon and David Mussafer and Steve Collins were both instrumental in helping to guide our growth in the early years. We look forward to having their guidance once again as we write the next lululemon chapter. To summarize, we are on track in building the foundation for our next phase of growth and we continue to focus on innovation and product, brand, guest experience and international growth. We are amplifying our brand storytelling, better leveraging our ambassadors and seeing steady improvement on product innovation and assortment. This foundational work we are doing today is strengthening our leadership position in the market that we originated. And with that, I will turn the call over to John to review the financials. John Currie : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin by reviewing the details of our second quarter of 2014 and then I'll update you on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of fiscal 2014. For Q2, total net revenue rose 13.4% to $390.7 million from $344.5 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in revenue was driven by total comparable store sales on a combined basis, including e-Commerce at 0%, comprised of 30% growth online and a bricks-and-mortar stores sales decline of 5%, all on a constant dollar basis; the addition of 44 net new corporate-owned stores since Q2 of 2013, 29 net new stores in the United States, 1 store in Canada, 1 in Australia, 3 stores in New Zealand, 1 in the U.K. and 9 ivivva stores; and offset with a foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $5.1 million or 1.3%. We were able to deliver above our Q2 expectations coming into the quarter due to strong performance of fall transition products that we were able to pull forward from Q3 and drive sales in July. During the quarter, we opened 7 net new corporate-owned stores, 5 in the U.S., 2 ivivva and 1 in Australia and New Zealand, offset with 1 closure in Australia. We ended the quarter with 270 total stores versus 266 a year ago. There are now 206 stores in our comp base : 39 of those in Canada, 136 in the United States, 23 in Australia and New Zealand and 8 ivivva. At the end of Q2, we also have a total of 93 showrooms in operation, 42 lululemon in North America, 18 internationally and 33 ivivva. Corporate-owned stores represented 75.3% of total revenue, or $294 million, versus 79.5% or $273.8 million in the second quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $63.5 million, or 16.2% of total revenue, versus $49.4 million or 14.3% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-ups and outlets, totaled $33.2 million, or 8.5% of revenue for the second quarter, versus $21.4 million or $6.2 million of revenue in the second quarter of last year. Gross profit for the second quarter was $197.3 million, or 50.5% of net revenue, compared to $186 million or 54% of net revenue in Q2 2013. The factors which contributed to this 350 basis point decline in gross margin were : product margin decline of 260 basis points due primarily to a higher mix -- sales mix of lower-margin seasonal product; higher input costs, in particular, with print and textured fabrics; 40 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation; 70 basis points deleverage from continued investment in our design, merchandising and product engine functions; and 50 basis points deleverage from foreign exchange impact on product costs due to the weakening of the Canadian and Australian dollar. These were offset with a decrease in markdowns and discounts of 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013. SG&A expenses were $129.4 million, or 33.1% of net revenue, compared to $107 million or 31.1% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 17.3% SG&A dollar increase is due to an increase in operating expenses associated with new stores, showrooms and outlets, including higher store wages to reflect merit and base pay market adjustments; increased variable operating costs associated with that year-over-year growth in our e-Commerce business; increases in expenses at our Store Support Centre, including salaries, administrative expenses, professional fees and management incentive compensation; and in addition, we recognized $1.3 million in foreign exchange losses, attributable primarily to the revaluation of U.S. dollar cash balances in our Canadian subsidiary, which increased overall SG&A, this is compared to a $4.4 million foreign exchange gain in Q2 of 2013. These were offset with a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which are, on translation, decreased reported SG&A by $2.6 million, or 2%. As a percent of revenue, our second quarter SG&A deleveraged 200 basis points. As a result, operating income for the first quarter was $67.9 million, or 17.4% of net revenue, compared with $79 million or 22.9% of net revenue in Q2 2013. Tax expense for the quarter was $21 million, or at the rate of 30.1%, compared to $23.8 million at a tax rate of 29.7% in the second quarter of 2013. Net income for the quarter was $48.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $56.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2013. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 145.5 million versus 145.9 million a year ago. This takes into account the weighted impact of 1.4 million shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of 39 -- sorry, $39.24 per share. The impact of the share buyback on diluted EPS for the quarter was nominal due to the timing of when the shares were repurchased. Capital expenditures were $26.7 million for the quarter compared to $23 million in the second quarter last year with the increase associated with new stores, renovations, IT and head office capital. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $725.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was $176.5 million or 8.3% higher than the end of the second quarter of 2013, reflecting a sequential improved ratio of inventory to forward sales versus the first quarter of this year. This now leads me to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2014. We anticipate Q3 revenue in the range of $420 million to $425 million. This is based on comparable store sales -- sorry, comparable sales percentage increase in the low single digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2013 and assumes a Canadian dollar at $0.91 to the U.S. dollar and 19 new store openings : 1 in Canada, 15 in the U.S and 3 ivivva. Consistent with Q2, we expect gross margin to be approximately 51%. This is down from a year ago, primarily due to product sales mix deleveraged against product and supply chain expenses within cost of goods sold and store occupancy and depreciation, and lastly, the impact of foreign exchange due to a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar compared to last year. We expect SG&A to deleverage as a percentage of revenue compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven primarily from the run rate of strategic investments made last year, and incremental spend in traffic and revenue-driving initiatives that we mentioned last quarter. The majority of these costs associated with the driving traffic initiatives will be incurred in the back half of the year as the timing of some costs slipped from Q3 to Q2. Our SG&A outlook also reflects preopening costs related to the 19 stores planned to open in Q3 and additional stores planned to open in early Q4 of 2014. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 144.7 million diluted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share. For the full fiscal year 2014, we expect net revenue for the year to be in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.8 billion. We expect to open 47 corporate-owned stores, which, as Laurent mentioned earlier, now includes our first store Asia in Singapore and our first men's only store in SoHo New York. For the year, we expect gross margin of approximately 51%, down from last year due to the same factors impacting Q2 and Q3. We expect SG&A to deleverage as a percentage of revenue compared to 2013. This is primarily due to continued strategic investments in areas such as IT, international, traffic-driving initiatives and lapping both $17 million in foreign exchange gains realized last year and reduced management incentive compensation. As a result, we expect our overall operating margin to deleverage from 2013 and our fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.51 to $1.56 or $1.72 to $1.77 normalized for the nonrecurring tax adjustment we incurred in the first quarter. This is based on 145.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our guidance does not reflect any estimate of shares repurchased in future quarters and it assumes an overall effective tax rate of 38.5%, which includes the onetime tax adjustment or 30.2% excluding this tax adjustment. We expect capital expenditures to range between $110 million and $115 million for fiscal 2014, reflecting new store build-outs, renovation capital for existing stores, IT and other head office capital, including expansion of our existing premises. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Adrienne Tennant of Janney Capital Markets. Adrienne Tennant : Laurent, can you talk about what percentage of the July flows and go-forward are in the seasonal versus the core category. And then John, if you can you talk about the inventory. You had to pull some of it forward because demand was good. So where does that put you in terms of inventory flows going into the early part of fall season. So if you can talk a little bit about that. And then really quickly, the Canadian comp versus U.S., if you can talk to that. Laurent Potdevin : I mean, as far as the breakdown, I mean, we had this strategy of launching the transitional line that was a bridge between summer and fall that was received really well and the sell-through was higher than anticipated. And so we had a plan of selling 3 weeks of those in July, as well as the first 2 weeks of August and we pretty much moved all of that product in July. So that probably created a void in the first 2 weeks of August. What is the breakdown exactly? Tara Poseley : So I have mentioned -- the question also is about the balance of season versus core so -- and as we have talked about in the last call, in Q1, the balance as we move into the back half of the year is going to be about 40% in core, which is similar to what it trended in 2012. John, did you want to... John Currie : Yes. On your question on pulling inventory from Q3 into July. Moving the transition line up into July helped July sales relative to what we'd expected when we gave guidance. That did leave us a little bit lighter in that product for August, but still had some remaining that has helped us through August, but a little bit lighter than what we'd expected. So when you look at our revenue guidance from last quarter for the full year, it's really just been a shift from Q3 into Q2. And your other question on comps. On a combined basis, U.S. was up slightly low single digits and Canada was down mid-single digits. Operator : Our next question is from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jessica Schmidt : This is Jessica Schmidt on for Ed. Laurent, you've been in the position for a while now. So where do you think you still need to invest to get systems and processes to where you really want them to be? And do you think you have the necessary tools to manage the business? Laurent Potdevin : Well, I really do feel that we've got the necessary tool. I mean, as I mentioned on the call and actually on the prior call, I mean, we are on this journey of building the foundation and I'm really excited to see the team hitting all of the milestones so far. I mean, it's a really deep project that will see all of its results pay off by the first quarter of 2016. But one of the first milestones being to free up a lot of our designers' time and giving them a lot more room to create has been achieved and we've rebalanced the whole calendar. So that first milestone is incredibly critical in our process of really building the most technical, innovative products. So we have the investments. We're still building the team that we've made a lot of progress in getting a lot of amazing talent onboard. And so I'm really excited. It's by no mean a finished project and there is still much work to be done, but we're very much on track, both from a human capital standpoint, from a financial standpoint and from a technology and process standpoint. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan. Brian Tunick : I guess, 2 questions. I'm sorry if we missed any comments you made about the second quarter comp drivers, whether it was traffic or conversion. You're -- we're curious, in terms of traffic, if there's any sense of loyalists versus new customers, what you're seeing there. And then on the SG&A, John, just some more color on this timing shift. Can you give us some idea of how much spending is shifting into the second half? And it looked a little like you may have reduced your fourth quarter implied earnings guidance. So we're just wondering was it comp or anything else in Q4 that might be taking a more conservative view. John Currie : Okay. On your first question, I mean, for the past couple of quarters, traffic has been down and that's what's negatively impacted our comp. But in Q2, actually traffic turned slightly positive so that's encouraging. But the comp was adversely impacted by lower conversion and average basket, which is consistent with the fact that our product assortment wasn't ideal, but again encouraging in terms of trends. In terms of the shift in SG&A, it's really referring to some of the paid search and other traffic-driving initiatives that we'd planned for the 3 quarters when we gave guidance last quarter. With sales trending a little bit higher at the back half of Q2, we didn't spend as much of that as we'd originally anticipated. It's a shift of maybe $2 million to $3 million from Q2 forward. And then your last question regarding Q4, of course, I haven't broken out Q4 in the past, so really the guidance I'm giving today doesn't indicate a drop in Q4. It's consistent with what we've included in my guidance when I gave it last quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Oliver Chen of Citigroup. Oliver Chen : I had a bigger picture question for Tara and Laurent. What are your longer-term ideas in terms of how we prioritize like the factors that will keep you ahead of the competition with respect to product? And then a financial question is on the gross margin side. Is our expectation for merchandise margins to continue to show that positive traction and product mix to continue to be a headwind? Laurent Potdevin : I mean, before I let Tara maybe getting more into the product, I mean really the bigger strategic moves are really in ramping up everything we do with our Whitespace workshop and combining that with our ambassadors. I mean, as I've said since day 1, I mean, our ambassadors are truly our most underleveraged asset. I mean, they are the voice -- the authentic voice of this brand and we've done a lot of work in having the Whitespace and the ambassadors collaborate in looking at new activities, looking at problems they want to solve during the activities and we have a lot in the pipeline, both from a performance standpoint, from a raw material standpoint and from a category standpoint and we'll be sharing that when we're ready. And obviously, not to forget all the work that we're doing to boost our international expansion that we're getting really strong demand internationally and we started to really accelerate the pace of our rollout with the Singapore store opening, the finalization soon of the Hong Kong location and the second location in London. Tara Poseley : So I think Laurent stated it well. I've been going through with the team over the last 6 months a rigorous process of building a 3- to 5-year product raw material strategies and innovation strategies. So obviously, as Laurent stated, we're not going to share those because it's proprietary, but that work is in motion and the teams are executing against that really tight project plan. Again, all of those areas are in place so we look forward to sharing those as we go into the future. Operator : Our next question is from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Camilo Lyon : I was hoping you could give us some color on the new DC opening, how that is expected -- or if that's expected to help product flows this year? Or is that a 2015 benefit? And then just if you could update us on the 2 new mills that you've added this year, their contribution to improving product flows. Laurent Potdevin : I mean, on the DC, I mean, the facility we just opened is in Columbus, Ohio and the biggest improvement right now is the service level to our guests, right? I mean, with the opening of that facility with no additional costs, I mean, we're reaching over 85% of our guests in 2 days. So as we head into Q3 and Q4, we're really excited to see that level of service improve. And then starting in January, we will be delivering to the stores from the facility. And what was the second part of the question? Tara Poseley : Something about mills. Operator : Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : John, as we think about the gross margin trajectory going forward, is your expectation that you'll be able to get back into the mid-50s? Or is the focus on fashion and seasonal product going to keep the margin down in the low 50s going forward? John Currie : As we've said, I mean, in the near term, you're likely to see gross margin in a similar range to what you've seen in Q2. The work underway that Tara's team and Jennifer's team are doing on the go-to-market calendar over the next couple of years, we see significant improvement in gross margin coming from those initiatives. I think I've said in the past, maybe 300-or-more basis points. And then in terms of pricing architecture, we're really not at a point of talking about whether there will be significant changes that would impact product margins. So for the time being, I assume that, that would not be a factor. But I mean, bottom, bottom line, just with the improvements on the process side, we see getting back closer to that mid-50s level. Lorraine Maikis : And what's the time frame on that? John Currie : Well, not until we get into 2016 and these initiatives have really taken hold and have impacted the seasons that we'll be delivering in 2016. Operator : Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : I just had a follow-up question on Lorraine's gross margin question. Obviously, understanding you don't want to reveal any trade secrets about the work you're doing on the supply chain, we're just trying to understand the move from the low 50s to the mid-50s in gross margin. Is that being driven by an ability to take price in the assortment? Are you looking at trying to save on average unit cost? Maybe if you can just help us understand what the levers are that could get you there. John Currie : Yes, it's really not based on taking pricing. That's always the last lever that we want to be pulling. It's primarily based on efficiencies, I mean the obvious ones being reduction in airfreight and some of the other costs, efficiencies coming from the new DC, but also just a much smoother and more efficient process from design all the way through to delivering to the stores. Operator : Our next question is from Omar Saad of ISI Group. Omar Saad : Two questions. First one is on the success you're seeing in the transitional merchandising assortment. What's really going on there? What are you learning? What's so good about the assortment that's really driving that business? And how can you kind of carry forward that momentum or even build upon it going forward? Any insight, especially around product and stylings that's driving that? And the second question I have is on ivivva. You mentioned a really good number there -- comp number there. I know it's really small, but maybe you could talk about the long-term vision for that concept and brand and how it's going to fit versus the lululemon brand and complement it and where you see that going long term? Tara Poseley : So I'll answer the success of the transition line. I think it really underscores what I had been talking about over the last 2 quarters about our opportunity to be really consistent in bringing the beauty and the technical back to our products and I think that line, definitely illustrating that. I also think the work that the team did with print and also some of the print that we chased into in the quarter also we saw great response there. So again it's just that newness and beauty, that's always underscored by a great technical product. I mean, did you want to talk about ivivva? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, I mean, with ivivva and especially having a 12-year-old daughter, I mean, I'm very, very excited about the work that we're doing with ivivva. I mean, there's so much correlation with what we're doing at lululemon. And when you see the Dreams & Goals programs that we rolled out for little girls, I mean, it's been incredibly well embraced by our young guests. And with sales getting into -- close to $1,000 per square foot, I mean, we're very happy with the result. And we're creating the next generation of lululemon guests, so a very exciting prospect. And in the meantime, we're doing great work with our -- in our communities with little girls. So yes, we see a bright future with ivivva. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Drbul of Nomura Securities. Robert Drbul : John, I was wondering if you could give us some commentary around new store productivity trends, U.S., Canada, men's productivity, ivivva productivity. John Currie : Okay. Just making sure I don't miss any part of the question. New store productivity, again, in Q2, new store productivity was coming in around $1,100 to $1,200 a square foot, that's similar to where we've been coming in for the last year or more. In terms of men's, we don't really break up productivity by men's. I mean, in terms of comp, I mean, men's comp up 5%. But again, I don't have that productivity broken out. And as Laurent mentioned, ivivva, it's on track to end the year at somewhere a little over $1,000 per square foot of productivity. Robert Drbul : Got it, okay. And I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys give a full year e-Comm sales estimate that's included in the guidance today? John Currie : We didn't break out whole year e-Commerce estimate, e-Commerce is -- in Q2, it was running about 16%. Typically, it goes up a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we haven't specified an e-Commerce  number for the year. Operator : Our next question is from Betty Chen of Mizuho Securities. Betty Chen : I was just wondering, John, if you can talk a little bit more to the SG&A deleverage. Should we expect the magnitude to be similar to what we saw in the first half? Or given the shift in timing, should it be a little bit greater? And whether we should expect that growth rate to continue in 2015? And then my second question is related to earlier. What were the women's comp during the second quarter? And how did that measure against Q1, if we saw any sequential improvement? John Currie : Okay. SG&A, the guidance I've given, say, for Q3, I you see a margin profile pretty similar to Q2. The thing to watch for as you look at our second half, and I mentioned Q2 was skewed a little bit by sort of nonrecurring sort of foreign exchange gains last year versus losses this year and that simply comes from the balance sheet date revaluing the U.S. dollars held in the Canadian company, so it's really not an indication of the health of the business. But if you look at last year, the Canadian dollar dropped significantly. So for the full year last year, as I said in my prepared remarks, the foreign exchange gain that was offsetting our SG&A was about $17 million and most of that was in the back half. So we wouldn't expect to have that benefit again this year. Also last year, because we missed our budget and plans, our bonus accruals were reduced, primarily in the back half, and that was sort of a high single-digit millions benefit to SG&A this year that we won't enjoy that -- sorry, last year that we won't enjoy this year. Seems strange to say enjoy a lack of a bonus, but anyway. Women's comp, I said men's was plus 5%. I believe women's was just slightly negative. Operator : Our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Mann : I wanted to ask another gross margin question. In the last couple of quarters, we've seen some pretty nice sequential improvement in the rate of decline in your product margins. You called out last quarter 110 basis points of discounts that hurt and you didn't call it out this quarter. And then also some of the negative mix impact got better. I was actually curious, how do we think about what's embedded in your gross margin guidance for the back half of the year? Could you actually get a bit of a tailwind from discounts that you put into place in the fourth quarter? Or are we looking at the 2Q kind of run rate kind of product margin compression being pretty similar? John Currie : Yes. Looking at the back half, I mean, your question on discounts, we -- I don't think I called that out, but I mean markdowns and discounts were a little bit lighter in Q2 this year than last year. The back half, there might be a little bit of a tailwind because we had an online warehouse sale last year. We may not duplicate that this year. But other than that, I mean, the items in our gross margin guidance, I mean, there continues to be some tailwind from product mix; FX, again the Canadian dollar continuing lower will impact at sort of 30 to 50 basis points; and with lower year-over-year revenue, there's deleverage on our fixed costs, so occupancy and depreciation and the cost of the product teams. So those continue to be the main pieces of the gross margin guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Filandro of Susquehanna Financial Group. Thomas Filandro : I had a question on the DTC channel. I was hoping you can give us a sense of like what's driving the acceleration? Is it transaction, the average dollar growth, anticipation of what we should see for the balance of the year? And can you also address what the contraction was in that channel? I think it was down 220 or so for the period. And then Laurent, just very quickly, I think you mentioned this earlier about the omni-channel initiative in-store driving some perform there. Can you expand on exactly what it is you guys are doing in-store to offer that customer the full assortment? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, we've rolled out -- it was a pilot earlier this year, maybe even at the end of last year actually and we rolled out to all stores now the bag backroom app. So it's an iPod device that's rolled out in all of our stores that give access to the entire online inventory for our educators to see to service our guests. So when you're in-store, you not only obviously have access to the in-store inventory, but now you have access to the whole online inventory and we've seen great momentum in growing this business last quarter to about 1% of our retail sales. So much better service for our guests and much better use of our online inventory. And we've also rolled out a new guest order management system that allows us to flow the orders better through the different DCs. So that was the bag backroom app and obviously we set up a full group in-house to really look at the guest experience. And as we build further technology, I mean, we're obviously going to enhance -- we're going to continue to play with technology and enhance the service that we're providing in maximizing the inventory between the channels. John Currie : On your question on your DTC, as I said in the prepared remarks, e-Commerce comped up 30%. That was driven pretty much entirely by increased traffic. So strong traffic growth continues, not much of a change in terms of conversion or average order value. Your other question, I think, you said down 220 basis points, you might be looking at the margin -- the DTC margin that's contained in the Q. But if that's what you're getting at, it's really just a flow-through of the lower gross margin. Most of the costs related to DTC are variable other than the product margin. Operator : Our next question is from Faye Landes of Cowen and Company. Faye Landes : I'm just hoping that you can elaborate a little bit more on inventory. The -- pretty consistently, the products that sell really well sell out ahead -- earlier than you've expected, which is, in some ways, a high-class problem, obviously, but you're also leaving money on the table. I don't remember the last quarter where that didn't happen. So can you talk about how you plan to adjust things so you can fully capitalize on the opportunities that you have? Tara Poseley : Okay, I'll take that one. Yes, so what we talked about in Q1 where we've seen the high sell-through in the seasonal goods and we had over planned our expectations for it. So what we did for Q3, obviously we weren't able to affect Q2, what we did for Q3 was really shift that core investment open-to-buy into the seasonal product. We went back and looked at sell-throughs on all of our seasonal products in Q1, made sure we are planning our APS appropriately in Q3 and really get that diligence in making sure we were investing appropriately. But we will -- I mean, we also do really value the scarcity model. We've done very well markdown rate in the brand, which I love. So it's always that fine balance and that's what we are working and perfecting towards. And then as part of what we had talked about, I think we had mentioned this earlier, we're in the process of implementing a new planning and allocation tool that will be fully live for the planning of winter 2015 and we're on time and on budget with the execution and implementation of that tool. Operator : Our next question is from Howard Tubin of RBC Capital Markets. Howard Tubin : Can you just update us on where you stand on like senior level hires and what senior level open positions are still there? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, we've got 4 senior level positions open. We're in the final stages of the HR and brand and community search and we're probably about halfway through the process with the CFO search and the Managing Director for Europe search. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Lejuez of Wells Fargo. Paul Lejuez : Sorry if I missed any comments about the showrooms, but can you maybe talk about how your showrooms are performing? What percent of them are you happy with? And which geographies do you feel most comfortable that the brand is resonating? John Currie : Maybe I'll take that. We had probably the most showrooms we've ever had open during the quarter. I think it was 90, 93. 33 of those are ivivva, which is a real expansion of the showroom program for ivivva. The showrooms in North America for lululemon continue to perform as they have and they are our barometer for where a market is ready for a store. I think, more interestingly, the international showrooms, speaking broadly, the ones in Asia are doing extremely well, much better than the counterparts that we had in the U.S. as we expanded into the U.S. So Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, those showrooms are very strong, which is an indication that there had already been brand awareness in Asia. In Europe, with the London store opening well ahead of our expectations and the other showrooms in London are continuing to perform very well again because there's growing brand awareness in London. And the other European showrooms are really doing quite similar to how the U.S. showrooms did when we really expanded that program back in 2009. So they're on track building brand awareness and we're building showroom sales, which is one of the indications of when we are ready to open stores. So I'd say, overall, the European showrooms are on track. Operator : Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner of Topeka Capital Markets. Dorothy Lakner : Just a question for, I guess, either Laurent or Tara. In terms of the milestones that we should be looking at into the back of the year as to where you are in the calendar and getting to where you want to be from a product standpoint, what should we be looking for as that product comes into the stores in the second half of the year. You were obviously able to chase more in second quarter. What should we be looking for in the third and into holiday? Tara Poseley : So for the back half, obviously, the go-to-market calendar and all the work that we're doing with that, we commenced that in Q1 of this year. So obviously that did not affect Q3 and Q4 of this year since that was already bought and commercialized at that time. So really for the back half of the year, it was rebalancing the core versus the seasonal, which I just talked about a few minutes ago and just making sure that we are investing appropriately in the seasonal. We continue to really focus with the design team on making sure we're getting all of that beauty and technical, always technical, back into our products because we are very proud that we are the originator for that in that -- in the space and a lot of focus there. So that's really -- that's the focus for this year and then just using our Fast Turn where we can to continue to chase into products. A good example of that is the Fast Turn team to create a special capsule -- a little capsule product to vibrate before Black Friday. [indiscernible] price selling during that weekend. Operator : Our next question is from Janet Kloppenburg of JJK Research. Janet Kloppenburg : Tara, just a question on the product mix. I think you've introduced a lot of new bottoms to try and reinvigorate that core category. I was wondering if you could talk about the performance there and your outlook as we go forward for that category. And Laurent, I think you had defined $10 million in incremental SG&A spending on traffic-driving initiatives for the stores and -- or for the entire business and I'm wondering if that -- there was impact on the SG&A line from that in the second quarter or if most of that will be incurred in the back half or if we potentially could see more investment there. Tara Poseley : Yes, Janet, you're right. We had talked about that Q3 was going to be a focus on really reinvigorating our core products starting with the bottom. And early signs are that some of the -- there is some emerging core that is in-store now that we're excited about as we move in  -- I'm not going to call out what those involve because that's proprietary information, but we are seeing some good signs there. And then as we move into Q4, the other area that we have -- we're really clear that we needed to continue to evolve and create newness within tops and the tanks and we're also we'll be testing some new emerging core in those areas as well. And then the Fast Turn team will continue to also be testing and learning and getting that insight and information that we can chase into the future quarters. Laurent Potdevin : And then to the second part of your question, I mean, we had allocated $7 million to drive traffic through increased paid search, online campaigns, e-mail segmentation and redesigning our product notification that are so relevant to our guests. And most of that spend will happen in the back half of the year. I mean, in Q2, I think we spent less than $1 million on it and we looked at sell-through and inventory and saved that investment for the second part of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Sam Poser of Sterne Agee. Ben Shamsian : It's Ben Shamsian for Sam. Wanted to dig in a little bit more on the brick-and-mortar side of the business. Can you provide us with the traffic in the brick-and-mortar stores? And then, if you could, the comps by month in the brick-and-mortar? John Currie : Traffic in bricks-and-mortar was up sort of mid-single digits and -- but I don't break up monthly comps. I will say, though, that July ended up a little stronger than our expectations because of, as we talked about, the pull-forward of the transition line. Operator : Our next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Can you talk a little bit about where do you stand on some of the improvements and -- from the third-party consultants, what you're learning as they look at the organization and the processes? And then just lastly, Tara, what -- on the new line where you've seen the big improvement, on the style, price, how are the learnings able to influence the other products flows in the short term? And is the margin of this product, do you see that developing early in the ability to have improved margin? Tara Poseley : Okay. So the third-party consultants that we brought in to help us with re-engineering our go-to market calendar, we've had really good insight. I think, on the whole, it's a lot around how we were sequencing events within the calendar and we're going through a process of resequencing how we bring products to market. Some things were happening too late in the process that need to be moved forward. I'm not get into all that detail, but we've really, really honed in on what those pieces are and are going through the process of a redesign of every single quarter for each season. And we are on track by Q1 of 2016 to have a fully operational go-to-market calendar. And then, I think, -- Dana, what was your second question? It was about style and price and what we can do in the short term? This is a very scrappy and entrepreneurial culture, which I deeply value and we literally are learning minute-by-minute about our assortments as we see that getting in and using our Fast Turn team when we can to react quickly to get those learnings in and then also infusing that into any of the learnings into the future seasons that are in process and being worked on. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Laurent Potdevin for closing remarks. Laurent Potdevin : We'd like to thank you, all, for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again in the quarter. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Hosting our call today is Laurent Potdevin, the company's CEO; John Currie, the company's CFO; along with Tara Poseley, our Chief Product Officer, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. We would like to remind everybody that statements contained on this call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.  Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn it over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. John will discuss the numbers in more detail and speak to our updated guidance in a few minutes.  Today, I will summarize the areas where I see prevailing momentum building within the company, and provide an update on areas where we continue to strengthen our business foundation. I'm very proud of our team and the solid performance delivered in the third quarter, with a total combined comparable sales growth of 3% that showed improvement over our second quarter, marking a key inflection point with our women's business returning to positive territory. As expected, we delivered better product assortment, which was a key driver of improved performance this fall, compounded with more cohesive brand and product communication in stores, online and through our PR strategy. We were pleased to see sequential improvement in each month of the quarter as it progressed, driven by our product flows and new allocations. Overall, I attribute the success of the third quarter to the ongoing foundational work as we've described in the past, building our talent pool, improving our processes and integrating brand and product. We have turned an important corner, and we'll continue to be relentless about keeping the slide wheel turning and accelerating. Let's take a look -- an early look at Q4. The fourth quarter was kicked off with our annual leadership conference in Vancouver. By gathering up approximately 900 of our key leaders, including staff from our store support center, store and showroom managers and top executives, representing amazing talent from around the globe. Since joining lululemon back in January, I've been anticipating our most important yearly gathering as a team, and whether it was in a small breakout session, on my mat side-by-side with 900 colleagues doing yoga together, it was absolutely amazing to witness the passion and the commitment to lululemon and our long-term purpose. It was a tremendous confirmation that our people are second to none, and will continue to be a unique competitive advantage, as we engage with our guests everyday around the world. The whole team left our conference inspired, energized and ready to deliver on our goals. We are pleased with our November performance, as we sustained October's momentum and delivered on our sales plan, with fewer markdowns than November of last year. Black Friday's performance was very strong, led by the special cast [ph] of our Sequence digital trend, which drove guest excitement and traffic to our stores. Looking ahead to the remainder of the quarter. Our team continues to monitor and assess the situation at the West Coast port. Our business is sensitive to this disruption since we schedule a constant replenishment of our inventory with fluid [ph] product drops at our store. With the slowdown at the West Coast port and units still on the water, we are actively implementing a number of strategies to mitigate delivery issues. We have been experiencing delays of 7 to 10 days, and on that basis, we estimate that this will impact our fourth quarter and year-end revenue guidance by approximately $10 million. We are continuously assessing the situation, and our entire team is focused on supporting the upcoming key holiday selling weeks, and maintaining our positive trajectory into January. Turning to our product, which continues to lead the premium athletic apparel category. The strategic rebalance of our women's product assortment is paying off. Our increased focus on the pant wall, which is an anchor of the lululemon brand, resulted in positive comps. We were also the fall destination for our women's running gear. And our cold weather layering program resonated exceptionally well with our guests. In the men's category, we expanded both in-store and online assortment, expanding our breadth of style, resulting in a strong performance, with an 11% comp this past quarter. For our younger guests, ivivva broadened its outerwear selection, and created excitement with the launch of additional trends and textures in seamless assortment, delivering a positive comp of 37%. We are on track to open 10 ivivva stores by the end of 2014. Innovation will drive the future of our product's success. We continue to invest in R&D dollars in new fabrics, innovative construction and the expansion of our offering across new categories. And I'm very inspired with the data, which we're making progress, and look forward to sharing more details with you as we move into next year. Next year, we will finish the foundation work in our product engine, go-to-market process and supply chain so we can see the tangible payout in 2016 that we have outlined in prior calls, and we will begin to shift our investment strategy towards future growth and innovation. The guest experience that we're known for continues to be a key area of focus, and we continuously strive to improve our online guest experience. Mobile commerce is trending to be approximately 1/4 of our total e-commerce activity. This past quarter alone, we launched our first mobile shopping app, which was downloaded 274,000 times, and represents approximately 8% of online sales. Additionally, we launched the redesign of the My Account feature on our website, resulting in a 27% increase in new accounts being captured this past quarter alone. With the opening of our new distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, we have seen our average transit times for online orders reduced by 46%, now averaging just under 2 days throughout the entire United States. The recent openings of our flagship stores were a fantastic avenue to building brand awareness both with our local and international guests. This past quarter, our Canadian flagship store opened on Robson Street in Vancouver, and almost immediately became one of the top-performing stores across our entire portfolio. We now expect Robson's volume to be 50% higher than its original location, and trending to be a $16 million store. This month, we opened a flagship store in Santa Monica that exceeded all opening sales targets and traffic goals. Its design aesthetics honor the active and social lifestyle of L.A.'s websites, and celebrated coastal beauty, and at 5,700 square feet, it is the largest lululemon retail store to date. The space dedicated to men's is second only to our new stand alone store in SoHo, which just opened on Black Friday. Our flagship stores have generated brand excitement and will be key assets in our future growth. Moving now to our international activities. We are proactively building on the pent-up demand for lululemon outside of North America. On our last call, I outlined our goals to add a total of 40 new stores in Europe and Asia by 2017. Our 2015 international real estate pipeline is very robust, and we are on track to open our first store in the Middle East in the second half of 2015. Our Covent Garden store in London continues to perform well, and our second store in Chelsea is expected to open next month. Our Singapore store is set to open in a few hours, and we had almost 3,000 people join us at the recent Singapore Yoga Beat event on Orchard Road, and we're excited to further connect with our guests in Singapore. Speaking more specifically to our brand and community efforts. Last year, our No Humbug social media campaign was a tremendous success. This year, we launched our Give Presence campaign for the holiday season, which has been getting instant tractions from guests through all social channels. Our Give Presence video generated over 1.2 million views within the first week of launch, and has now reached 3.5 million views. And we continue to attract incredible talent to our team. I'm really proud to welcome Duke Stump as our new Executive Vice President of Brand and Community. I was inspired by Duke from the minute we met. He shares our vision of creating transformational experiences for people and his extensive background within the athletic apparel industry, combined with leadership and in socially conscious brands make him a superb fit. I'm confident that under Duke's leadership, we will continue to build a bold, audacious, innovative global brand. We have also built upon our product team with experienced leaders and technical experts. We have hired Lee Holman as Senior Vice President of our women's design division and Mark Baxendale as Senior Vice President of Planning and Allocation, both doing tremendous strategic and global retail experience, and last but not least, we are in the final stages of our CFO search, and I'm confident that we will have a smooth transition. Before turning this over, I recognize that this is our last earnings call with John by my side. On behalf of all others at lululemon, I want to thank John for his enormous contributions since joining the company in 2007. John's influence and leadership helped take lululemon public, and has continued to shape our success today. As John embarks on his next phase in his life, I want to personally thank him for his support and wish him much, much happiness in retirement with incredible powder days during his ski days and sunshine on his bowling days. With that, I will turn the call over to John, who will review the financial details of Q3 and our 2014 guidance. John? John Currie : Thanks, Laurent. I'll begin by reviewing the details of our third quarter of 2014, and then I'll update you on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2014. Our Q3 total net revenue rose 10.4% to $419.4 million from $379.9 million in the third quarter of 2013. Increase in revenue was driven by total comparable store sales growth on a combined basis, including e-Commerce of 3%, comprised of 27% growth online and a bricks-and-mortars stores sales decline of 3%, all on a constant dollar basis; the addition of 42 net new corporate-owned stores since Q3 of 2013; 27 net new stores in the United States; 2 stores in Canada; 2 stores in New Zealand; 1 in the U.K.; and 10 ivivva stores; and offset with the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australia dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $7.5 million or 1.8%. This was more than we had anticipated, as these currencies weakened late in the quarter. This impacted our third quarter relative to our expectations and our outlook for the balance of the year. During the quarter, we opened 19 net new corporate-owned stores, 15 in the U.S., 1 in Canada and 3 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 289 total stores versus 247 a year ago. There are now 222 stores in our comp base, 37 of those in Canada, 151 in the United States, 25 in Australia and New Zealand and 9 ivivva. At the end of Q3, we also have a total of 86 showrooms in operation : 34 lululemon in North America, 16 internationally and 36 ivivva. Corporate-owned stores represented 73.9% of total revenue or $310 million versus 76.5% or $290.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $77.2 million or 18.4% of total revenue versus $62 million or 16.3% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-ups and outlets totaled $32.2 million or 7.7% total revenue for the third quarter versus $27.3 million or 7.2% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit for the third quarter was $211.1 million or 50.3% of net revenue compared to $204.6 million or 53.9% of net revenue in Q3 2013. The factors which contributed to this 360 basis point decline in gross margin were product margin decline of 90 basis points due primarily to a combination of sales mix and input costs, 80 points of -- basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation, 150 basis points deleveraged from continued investment in our product engine and supply chain functions, and 40 basis points deleverage from the foreign exchange impact on product costs due to the weakening of the Canadian and Australian dollar. SG&A expenses were $129.9 million or 30.9% of net revenue compared to $112.3 million or 29.6% of net revenue for the same period last year. The 15.7% SG&A dollar increase is due to an increase in operating expenses associated with new stores, showrooms and outlets; increased variable operating costs associated with the year-over-year growth in our e-Commerce business; and increases in expenses at our store support center, including salaries, administrative expenses and professional fees, partially offset by a $3.5 million reduction in management incentive and stock-based compensation accruals. Lastly, the weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which on translation, also decreased reported SG&A by $3.4 million or 2.6%. As a result, operating income for the first quarter was $81.2 million or 19.4% of net revenue compared with $92.3 million or $24.3 million -- 24.3%, sorry, of net revenue in Q3 of 2013. Tax expense for the quarter was $22.5 million or a tax rate of 27.1% compared to $27.7 million or a tax rate of 29.5% in the third quarter of 2013. A lower tax rate was a result of truing up our tax expense based on finalized prior year tax filings. Absent this true-up, our tax rate would have been 30.3%.  Net income for the quarter was $60.5 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to net income of $66.1 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2013. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 143.4 million versus 146 million a year ago. This takes into account the weighted impact of 1.8 million shares repurchased during this quarter at an average price of $40.49 per share.  The impact of the share buyback on diluted EPS for the quarter compared to our guidance was nominal due to the timing of when these shares were repurchased. Capital expenditures were $37.3 million for the quarter compared to $27.9 million for the third quarter last year, with the increase associated with new stores, renovations, IT and head office capital. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $633.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $229.9 million or 11% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2013, which is consistent with our expected revenue growth. This now leads me to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014. We anticipate Q4 revenue in the range of $570 million to $585 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low single digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, and assumes a Canadian dollar $0.88 to the U.S. dollar and 13 new store openings : 9 in the U.S., 1 in Singapore, 1 in the U.K., 1 in Australia and 1 ivivva. Now please note that the revenue range for Q4 implied in the guidance I gave last quarter was $585 million to $600 million or $15 million higher. In the first 5 weeks of this quarter to date, we've been trending consistent with the high end of this range. However, as Laurent mentioned earlier, we estimate the impact of the West Coast port delays will be approximately $10 million over the balance of the quarter. The remaining reduction in our revenue expectations comes from 2 factors : the lower Canadian and Australian dollar and delayed store openings, notably our second store in London on King's Road in Chelsea, which due to construction delays, will miss the holiday season, and will open in late January. We expect gross margin to be between 51% and 52%. This is down from a year ago, primarily due to product sales mix, deleverage against product and supply chain expenses within cost of goods sold and store occupancy and depreciation, and lastly, the impact of foreign exchange due to a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar compared to last year. We expect SG&A deleverage by 400 basis points as a percentage of revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. As a reminder, we are annualizing $11 million in foreign exchange gains and $9.1 million in bonus reversals incurred in Q4 2013, which contributes to 340 basis points of the deleverage to the fourth quarter this year. The remainder is driven primarily from the run rate of investments made last year and some timing of spend that shifted to Q4. Our SG&A outlook also reflects preopening costs related to the 13 stores planned to open in Q4, and additional stores planned to open in early Q1 of 2015. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 142.6 million diluted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.69 per share. For the full fiscal year, we expect net revenue for the year to be in the range of $1.765 billion to $1.78 billion. We expect to open 48 corporate-owned stores, which as Laurent mentioned earlier, now includes our first store in Asia, in Singapore, and our second store in London, as well as our first men's-only store in SoHo, New York. For the year, we expect gross margin of approximately 51%, down from last year due to the same factors we've discussed earlier. We expect SG&A to deleverage as a percent of revenue compared to 2013. This is primarily due to continued strategic investment in areas such as IT, international expansion, brand, and again, lapping both the $17 million in the foreign exchange gains incurred throughout last year and reduced management incentive compensation. As a result, we expect our overall operating margin to deleverage from 2013 and our fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.53 to $1.57 or $1.74 to $1.78 when normalized for the nonrecurring tax adjustment we incurred in the first quarter this year.  This is based on 144.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our guidance does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q3, and it assumes an effective overall tax rate of 37.9%, which includes the onetime tax adjustment or 29.4%, excluding this tax adjustment. We expect capital expenditures to range between $115 million and $120 million for the fiscal year, reflecting new store build-outs, renovation capital for existing stores, IT and other head office capital, including expansion of our existing premises. With that, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Since you talked a little bit about opening stores in Singapore and you're expanding internationally, Laurent, given your comments, your prepared remarks, I was just wondering if you could talk about the showroom performance that you're seeing in the varying region. Is there any variances between showroom performance in Europe or in Asia, anything to call out there specifically? And maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing in some of those regions that gives you some of the confidence that the growth opportunities remain as strong as ever? Laurent Potdevin : Well, I think 2 things to point out about the showrooms. I mean, in Europe, we see showroom performance that is very much in line with what we saw earlier when we opened showroom in the U.S. And in Asia, we see a very strong showroom performance, and it's the result of having been there for longer time, longer period of time. The showroom have been opened in Hong Kong for almost 4 years now. So that explains this outsized performance in Asia compared to Europe, but Europe is on track with what we saw in the early years in the U.S. I mean, as far as the outlook, I mean, I really do have a long-term view on both Europe and Asia as having really large potential, and the rest of the world being -- we see larger than North America. Their economies are fluctuating, and our showroom strategy is a really a very powerful and frugal way to go-to-market. So we're opening markets in region. We're seeing traction where we have showrooms, and that will dictate the rollout. So we're still on target to open 40 stores both in Europe and Asia, 20 in each region by 2017, and that might fluctuate a little bit based on European or Asian performance. But long-term, I mean, I see the potential of both regions as remaining very large for the organization. Matthew McClintock : And then if I can have follow up to John. Just 150 basis points of supply chain pressure on the margin -- on gross margin this quarter that you felt. How should we think about that over the next several quarters, given that you continue -- you should continue to make supply chain investments in 2015 setting yourself up for 2016? Just the level of pressure that we should expect going -- for the next several quarters? John Currie : And you're right. And as we've said throughout the year, 2014 has been a year of investment in shoring up supply chain. I think, in this quarter it was a little bit higher than sort of a run rate based on some additional testing costs that came through in the quarter. But generally speaking, in 2014 -- '15, we'll continue to invest with the run rate of a bigger, more capable team, as you said, to deliver the benefits to product margin and gross margin that we've talked about for 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura. Robert Drbul : I just have 2 questions. Can you talk a little bit about the traffic trends in the stores, I guess, throughout the last quarter and then quarter-to-date? And John, can you give us the new store productivity trends that you're seeing? John Currie : Yes. Okay. And the good news within the comp both for Q3 and what we're seeing for Q4 is that -- and similar to Q2, traffic continues to build. So the traffic component of the comp in Q3 was stronger than -- even in Q2 when it turned positive. Now that's offset with lower conversion and units per transaction, which is understandable, given where, I think, we're at is definitely improving brand sentiment and the product assortment to match that is still catching up, but better for Q4. New store productivity continues to be running that $1100 to $1200 per square foot area, a little bit higher than more recent openings. So very consistent, strong performance on the new stores. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Filandro from Susquehanna. Thomas Filandro : So first, a quick question for John. Could you possibly dig a little deeper into the quarter store op margin? I think you contracted about 700 [ph]. So does that have anything to do with the store opening delays? And how should we think about that contraction if there's similar contraction in the fourth quarter? And then just quickly on the port slowdown, are the goods that are on the water, are they concentrated in any particular categories or classifications? John Currie : Okay. Yes. So on the store operating margin, in Q3, there was a little bit more contraction than would be the norm. I think that's natural, given there's a very heavy new store opening cadence in Q3 and more so than the prior year. So that contracted the store operating margin to be a little bit more than you'd expect typically. The port, to be honest, I couldn't tell you exactly if it's concentrated in anyone that product category. I think we have to assume it's across the board. The other thing that's important to note is even though the disruption with the ports is the U.S. ports, it also impacts our Canadian business because a lot of the ships that come from Asia might stop in L.A., Seattle, and then make their way up to Vancouver, where we unload for Canadian shipments. Operator : Our next question comes from Jennifer Black, Jennifer Black & Associates. Jennifer Black : Let me add my congratulations and good luck, John, in your new endeavors. John Currie : Thanks. Jennifer Black : I think this question is for Tara. You've done some magnificent collections, such as the Sparkle and Exquisite collections. And I wondered if you're planning to do a continuous flow of these collections all year long, and are you seeing an increase in units per transactions with the collections based on the coordinated items that lend themselves to outfitting? Tara Poseley : Jennifer, I think just to really reframe what we are focused on for third and fourth quarter of 2014 was really getting the balance of the inventory right between our core and our seasonal product. Q3 was really about tackling the pant wall, and really starting to test some new core products, as well as adding print and color and texture. So really, again, I'm going to underscore our continued focus on core. As we moved into holiday, obviously, it's such a big gift-giving time of year, really focuses the design teams on making sure we are -- wherever we could, getting that beauty and functional in our product because we know that's so incredibly core to our DNA of the brand. So naturally, some of these collections, like Sequence and the Exquisite group reinforce that beauty and functional element to our brand, and you'll continue to see those as we move into next year. But the place we're spending a lot of time on is that core, and we'll really know that the pant wall's not where it should be quite yet, and that's going to be a big focus of the design team as we move into Q1 and Q2 of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lewis from Wells Fargo. Tracy Kogan : It's Tracy Kogan, filling in for Paul. You mentioned that product mix hurt your merch margin by 90 bps, and I was just wondering what impact markdowns had on your gross margin this quarter, and then I just wanted to confirm that you said you were less promotional in November. And I was wondering if you were planning to hold that online warehouse sale in fourth quarter. John Currie : Okay, yes. In Q3, markdowns were actually a little bit less than the prior year. The only reason I didn't call it out was it was fairly minor, like maybe 10, 15 basis points, but we were less promotional in Q3. Sorry, your question on November. Laurent Potdevin : Markdown less on November. John Currie : Which, as you said in your prepared remarks, were less promotional. Oh, and the question of an online warehouse sale for Q4, that really depends on how we come through the holiday season, whether we do an online or a physical warehouse sale, that's yet to be determined... Laurent Potdevin : And the continuity... John Currie : [indiscernible] Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Betty Chen from Mizuho Securities. Alex Pham : It's Alex Pham on for Betty. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how the seasonal goods and fashion products were trending. And maybe in a mature market like Canada, give us a sense of that penetration versus core and what it currently looks like in the U.S. Tara Poseley : Alex, it's Tara. So the seasonal goods, as we delivered -- outside deliveries increased as we got into third quarter. We definitely saw a strong positive guest response to our seasonal goods. As I said a few minutes ago, the core product, both in the pants and in tanks is an area we're going to -- continuing to be focused on as we move into next year, really driving newness in our core product, which we know is so important. And speaking to the Canadian market, driving that newness in the core product is really going to benefit our Canadian guests quite tremendously because they're looking for that evolved core from us. But they're also responding very well to the seasonal. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Regarding the split-out between bricks-and-mortar versus online, do you expect that trend to continue in terms of running slightly negative in the stores? Or are you feeling like traffic may offset some of those dynamics? And then, Tara, as you do continue to focus on the core categories, is the expectation that the materials differ or you may have SKU breadth? How are you thinking about AUR and the innovation in terms of the product side, and what's ahead with the core? John Currie : In terms of bricks-and-mortar versus e-Commerce, I mean, as -- we've seen a -- e-Commerce has been strong. Bricks-and-mortar has been gaining traction, as I said, primarily benefited by traffic. And we do expect conversion to stop being the headwind it's been. So my guidance in Q4, actually, we're assuming that stores will be positive, which they have not been for some time. Tara Poseley : And then, Oliver, on core, just to remind everybody, development of new fabrics is about an 18 month process. So from the standpoint of seeing materials and fabric evolving, we really won't start seeing that until the back half of next year, and as we get closer to that, we can share that. And from the AUR perspective, I don't see, at this point, AUR going up. But as we're developing new innovation, new silhouettes, building more functional beauty into our product, we'll be looking at those products and making sure our price value equation is appropriately set in the marketplace. Oliver Chen : As a quick follow-up, could you comment on men's and how you feel about the positioning now and where it may have opportunity to evolve over time? Tara Poseley : I'm feeling really good about men's. Early indications of our men's-only store have been really great, positive guest response. We see, as we are giving men's expanded space both in our Robson store, our stand-alone store, we're able to expand each one of the categories from our sweat category to the no-sweat, which is really the sweatshirts and things you put on after you work out and post-sweat, which is really our Commute Line. We see all 3 of those categories have opportunity to add breadth within those. And as we move into next year, you'll see those categories growing online, which is a great place for us to continue to test and try and learn, as well as expanding what we're doing in our men's-only spaces, where we have that additional square footage. Laurent Potdevin : And to add to -- this is Laurent. To add to what John and Tara said, I mean, with a better product assortment, a better flow and also better predictability, we've been able to work much closely with our brand and community team and community -- and communicating very strong cohesive story, as you saw, during Black Friday, so -- and that's a big part of the confidence that we feel in building traffic and returning to positive store comps. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : With productivity in, I think, new stores sounds unchanged, any initiative to kickstart some of your more mature stores? Have you thought about a remodel program or can you just talk about performance in some of your stores more than 5 years old? Laurent Potdevin : Do you mind -- I mean, I'm sorry, it's really hard to hear you. Do you mind repeating the question, maybe getting a little bit closer to the phone? Matthew Boss : Yes. So productivity in some of your new stores, sounds like unchanged. If we think about some of the mature stores, can you just talk about any initiatives to kind of kickstart performance in your more mature stores, particularly those 5 years or older? John Currie : Yes. I mean, in general, especially a high-volume store, we regularly renovate them every 3 years and normal stores, 5 years. In addition, we've got an ongoing program, where older stores that were maybe not in the best location within a mall or on the street or were a little bit too small in terms of square footage, every year, we're doing relocations or expansions. And then in a limited number of cases, as we've talked about, so Robson Street in Vancouver is a good example. We've moved from a very strong 3,400-square-foot store up to more of a flagship store at 4,500 square feet, and that -- flagship's the wrong term because flagships are often characterized as marketing initiatives. But in our -- in this case, it's really a -- it's a much more profitable store. So we're looking for opportunities to make those shifts as well. Laurent Potdevin : And we have an entire group internally very much focused on guest innovation and guest experience, so you've seen Whitespace for product. When you think about that, that group has been the same focus on our guest experience, both online and in-store, so longer term, focus on the innovation, but certainly, something that will have an impact on those more mature stores. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just to circle back on the margin front. So it sounds like continued supply chain investments, what kind of a comp next year do you need to lever occupancy and rent? And then if you could just kind of breakdown -- as we think about gross margin, I mean, should we think about gross margin down next year and then the inflection being in 2016? John Currie : Yes, in terms of leverage on occupancy and depreciation, I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces. But in general, I'd say a sort of mid-teens comp -- or sorry, mid-single-digits, again, impacted by some of the renovations that we're doing, et cetera, but mid-single-digits is about right. I'm sorry, your second question was what? Matthew Boss : Yes, so gross margin overall, in aggregate, should we think about gross margin as down next year, given the supply chain investments? And is that a mid-single digit store comp or all-in comp? John Currie : I'm talking store comp. In terms of supply chain investment, gross margin, as I said, I mean, 2014, obviously, a build-the-foundation year, which is continuing into, certainly, the early part of 2015. In addition, we're sort of shifting our focus from simply building foundation investments to investments in supply chain that drive growth. So there'll be that as well, but of course, at this point, we're not guiding to gross margin next year, and in fact, we're still working through the details of new initiatives in terms of our budgeting for next year. So we'll give guidance for next year as we always do when we report Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon from Canaccord. Camilo Lyon : I had a couple of questions. Number one, could you tell us, John, what the impact of the online warehouse sale was to the third quarter? Number two, can you just update us on what you just said right now, the prior question, the shifting to investments in supply chain that will drive growth. What kind of investments are those, and what should -- what will we expect to see from the supply chain side that can lead to better growth? And then finally, on gross margin, are you at a point where the seasonal component can start to be a margin-accretive product category in 2015? John Currie : Well, I'll take the online warehouse question. Yes, in October, rather than just have markdowns in our -- we made too much site throughout the quarter, and really sort of concentrating sales into a limited time period, as opposed to more spread out in our outlets, we decided to do an online warehouse sale. It was like 3 days. I think we did $3 million to $4 million. Again, it was expected in our earlier guidance, but that did sort of concentrate that level of sales in online versus what -- what otherwise might have been outlets. Sorry, whenever you ask more than 1 question, I always have to ask what's the second question. Camilo Lyon : Sure, no problem. So just in response to the prior -- to a prior question, you talked about next year being the year in which you shift some of your supply chain investments to investments that will drive growth, if you could just elaborate on what that means? And then maybe for Tara, the seasonal componentry of your product set, are we at a point that 2015 should have positive gross margin contribution from the seasonal mix? Laurent Potdevin : So if you think about the shifting of the investments, I mean, think about further investments in R&D, in some of what Tara and her group are working on in fabrics and new silhouettes as well as continued seamless, authentic guest experiences, both online and in-stores, as well as our continued international development. Tara Poseley : And then for the seasonal component, as we move into next year and all the supply chain work we've done on our go-to-market calendar that we've been talking about, we should start seeing those -- we will start seeing those improvements in seasonal product as we move into the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA. Barbara Wyckoff : This question is for Tara. Can you talk about initiatives to stage basic -- excuse me, basic fabric, so you're better able to respond to reorders on seasonal goods and -- quickly? And can you just talk a little bit about the testing mechanism and timing on turnaround time, assuming the fabrics are on hand? Tara Poseley : Okay, so I think -- I just want to make sure -- so it's really just taking -- so I'll just talk about what we're working on right now as a team. We've built out a model to really project out our raw materials over a 5-year period, all of the different key raw materials that we use, which is really a stage 1 to make sure that over a 5-year horizon, we're staging the fabrics appropriately. So that's going to continue to help us in our process, really being able to build more speed into our process. And then as for testing, I mean, really, we've -- it was -- Q3 was when we had said we have all of our testing protocols in place upfront in the supply chain stream from raw materials to in our factories, and we hit that, and that's really where I was testing. I wasn't quite sure what your additional question was around testing. Kimberly Greenberger : Well, just the timing of the turnaround. Assuming you have the fabric, what -- how long does it take to -- if something checks, how fast can you get back in stock? Tara Poseley : Yes. I mean, I'm really not ready to talk about that at this moment in time, but just do know that that's all -- speed is important to us, and we continue to create these improvements in our supply chain in order to take advantage of speed. Operator : Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : John, I'm wondering if you can just address your long-term gross margin target. I know you've said in the past, you expect to be able to get back to that 55% level, but it looks like the majority of the decline in gross margin that you're experiencing is a structurally higher cost base. So in the absence of mid-single-digit positive store comps, do you think -- what do you think your long-term gross margin should look like? John Currie : Yes. And especially -- if we focus on the core North American business as the base layer, we continue to see the roadmap to get back to the sort of mid-50s gross margin that we had been at. All the work that Tara and Jennifer's teams are doing, as we've talked about in the past, we continue to believe those will deliver about 300 basis points in improvement in gross margin, as well, there's a lot of other efficiencies beyond that, that I think, over time, we'll be able to enjoy. I've mentioned it's not built into that 300 basis points, but even being more buttoned down, we'll be able to provide better guidance to our factory partners that will allow them to reduce the contingency that they need to build into our pricing. So there's other potential upside in there that we see -- that roadmap to 55%. Of course, as you layer on the new markets that are really -- Asia and Europe are effectively startups. Initially, they'll be a lower margin profile, but when they reach a relative level of maturity, that [indiscernible]. Kimberly Greenberger : Okay. And John, just one clarification. On the cash balance, $633 million, how much of that is in the U.S. and available for share repurchases? John Currie : I don't think there's a lot of it actually in the U.S. Having said that, we've provided already, I guess, in Q1 for the tax that we'll incur on moving cash up. So I think there's another $300 million that we can move up, where the taxes are already been provided for. Operator : Our next question comes from Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research. Janet Kloppenburg : John, thank you for all the help you've given us over the years and best of luck. Just a couple of quick questions. I was wondering if the supply chain -- I'm sorry, the port strike issues could have a tail end to the first quarter and -- or if you see that problem terminating here in the fourth quarter? And secondly, Tara, if you could just speak to the redesign of the core product. Do you think that's complete in terms of the leggings and the tanks or do you think there's more work to be done there? John Currie : Okay. In terms of the port situation, I mean, we're continuing to monitor it basically every day. Of course, if it turned into a strike then... Laurent Potdevin : It's not a strike... John Currie : Yes, it's not a strike right now. So that would, of course, change things for everyone, but having said that, we've taken steps with respect to our future shipments. So even by the end of December, shipments will be either -- a lot of them will be rerouted through Vancouver, get down to the states by rail. So that will still likely give rise to 1- to 3-day delay, but it won't be that 7 to 10 days that we've been -- that we're seeing right now. So I think as you get into Q1, even January, the impact, if it's status quo, should be minimal. Janet Kloppenburg : Tara? Tara Poseley : Okay. I'd like to call it the evolution of the core products. So I look at that -- we launched that work in Q3, but as I said, that work is going to be carried into next year. That was just really the start. And I think we've got still a lot of work to do on the tanks, and you'll see more of that as we move into Q1 and Q2, as well as us continuing to test and try new core styles in the bottoms. But we're progressing, and we are on our way. Operator : Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the comment you made about the women's business turning positive. If you think about a year ago, kind of with all the controversy going on and the impact it had on your traffic, and you kind of reflect on the last year, have you seen the female customer evolve or change at all? I know in our annual holiday survey, it really -- lululemon brand really jumped up with the teen customer, maybe you're seeing a younger consumer drive some of those positive comps in the women's business? Or are you seeing that core female consumer, loyal consumer, start to come back and spend more in the brand? Laurent Potdevin : I think we're seeing both. I mean, we're seeing both. We're seeing much greater brand sentiment, and we're seeing, obviously, much greater traffic, I mean, in a lot of the retail that we've seen when Advent came onboard through Ben & McKenzie [sic] [ Baker & McKenzie ]. I mean, we've got a very loyal guest, and she's coming back, and she's coming back more often. So I think it's really a combination of gaining that core loyal customer, and giving her a lot more opportunities to engage with us and buy with us more often and bringing us new guests as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva from Oppenheimer. Anna Andreeva : I was hoping to follow-up, not sure if we missed it. What was the comp in Canada and Australia during the quarter? And in Canada, I think you've closed a handful of stores. Maybe talk about the margin profile in the region, and what's the ultimate store footprint that you see in Canada? And just as a follow-up to John. I'm not sure if you commented. Just the quarter-to-date commentary. Did comps continue to sequentially improve along with traffic? John Currie : Okay. Yes, Canada. Canada continued to be slightly negative, but again, improving. It was low-single-digit negatives versus the U.S. being low-single-digit positives. Australia is a little bit higher in terms of a comp. I mean, I think there's lots of opportunity there. It comped high single digits in the quarter. Again, I need you to repeat your second question. Anna Andreeva : Just on the store footprint opportunity in Canada. I think you closed a handful of stores. And just to follow-up on the quarter-to-date trend, are you seeing improvement in comp along with traffic? John Currie : Right. Okay, well, we don't -- we haven't closed any stores. What you're probably seeing is that we've taken some out of the comp base as we've moved them, renovated them. Robson, for example, was our second store worldwide, but with the relocation and the increase in size, it's out of the comp base. So other than that, there's no closures in Canada, and  the sequential -- sorry, third question. Can you repeat it again? Yes, I mean, the trend into November, I think, was your question, is traffic and other metrics are continuing to trend up better than what we saw in Q3. Operator : And our final question comes from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc Capital. Edward Yruma : Best of luck, John. I guess, 2 components, one, given the strong comps and store growth at ivivva, how would you describe the materiality of the business, the overall profitability? And two, on in-store inventory, I guess, how would you characterize it? I know you're obviously going to see an impact from the port delay, but are you sufficiently in stock to meet demand? John Currie : Okay. I mean, I think ivivva's got lots of traction, where, I think, this quarter, we crossed the $1,000-a-square-foot productivity point, but it's still very small. I mean, we'll end the year with 20 stores. They're smaller than lululemon stores so it's not a meaningful component at this point. Again, second question? Tara Poseley : In-store inventory, in stock to meet demand. John Currie : Yes. I mean, in stocking, we're more of a DC-based model. I mean, again, we started the quarter in pretty comfortable inventory positions. And I think through November, deliveries continued to maintain that position. Of course, with the port strike, that's -- or sorry, port disruption, that has caused a gap in this next little while. So we have about 1 million units that are stuck at the ports right now, but there is movement. They're coming through, so it's not optimal, and that's why I reflected that in reduced guidance, but we do see breaking that logjam. And then as I said, we've rerouted subsequent shipments through Vancouver so that the impact won't continue. Laurent Potdevin : All right, thank you very much, everybody. We wish all of you a very happy holiday season, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Mr. Chris Tham, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; and Stuart Haselden, CFO; along with Tara Poseley, our Chief Product Officer, who'll be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started today, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information which we have assessed, but which by the nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. [Operator Instructions].  And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to welcome Stuart on his first earnings call as lululemon's CFO. All of us at lululemon are thrilled to have him on our team, and I look forward to working together as we drive long-term, sustainable and profitable global growth.  Today, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2014 results as well as give you an update on our key initiatives in 2015. Stuart will then walk you through our financials in more detail and outline our guidance. After our remarks, we will open the call to your questions.  I am pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which concluded a year of solid progress towards our longer-term goals. We continue to see building momentum as reflected by the sequential acceleration of our top line results. Specifically, we delivered combined comparable sales growth of 8% in the fourth quarter versus 3% in the third quarter. We saw a positive global comp for our store business for the first time this year along with a double-digit increase in our e-commerce business. Our women's business momentum continued to build its positive comp in the quarter and most exciting is the high teens comp we delivered in the bottoms category as we capitalize on new silhouettes along with expanded styles and color. Additionally, we saw strong results in both our men's and ivivva businesses with 16% [ph] and 51% comps, respectively. With men's, we saw continued success with our pant category, anchored by the popularity of our core ABC pant and a great guest response to technical tops, such as lulu's fabric and seamless construction. ivivva's color and texture mix drove sales across multiple styles and categories. And for the 2014 fiscal year, our revenues reached $1.8 billion, increasing 13% over last year. So looking to our accomplishments in the fourth quarter and 2014 as a whole, you will recall that we established 3 key goals at the beginning of the year : first, to strengthen the business foundation; second, to reignite our product engine; and third, to accelerate our global expansion. In regards to our foundational investment, we substantially built out our management team with deep experience in critical areas. We strengthened our supply chain with talent, key technology investments and new processes to improve our ability to consistently deliver high-quality products on time while scaling the business. We opened a third distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, that will expand our distribution capacity for Europe and cut in half the shipping times to our guests and stores in the Eastern United States. And we successfully launched our mobile shopping app with over 367,000 [ph] downloads in 2014; and maybe even more relevant, an activation rate of 76%, which ended up representing approximately 8% of our online sales in Q4. In addition, we continued to leverage our bag [ph] backroom app to process sales in-store from our online inventory, which, in Q4, represented approximately 6% of online sales. We did reignite our product engine through the following actions : building on our design talent to mobilize us as a truly design-led organization and driving faster lead times in our whitespace innovation pipeline; continuing to leverage our ambassadors who play a very key role in the design, development and testing process to deliver functional performance and innovation; revamping our go-to-market spending calendar to synchronize design, merchandising and sourcing around 3 distinct product cadences : one, core; two, seasonal; and three, Fast Turn, all of them to achieve more compelling assortment with a higher degree of flexibility and higher speed to market. And we leveraged this new go-to-market calendar to harmonize with our brand and community strategy as we introduce exciting new products throughout the year. This allows us to better synchronize product education with our store educators and global ambassadors along with the ability to create compelling stories that inspire and inform our guests. As an example, we recently had great success with the introduction of the If You're Lucky technical yoga collection in Q1. Our guests responded very strongly to our storytelling as well as the great performing feminine technical product that features mesh panels, cutouts and beautiful prints.  And our men's business continues to extremely well with a continued momentum that supports this key element of our growth strategy driven by our sweat line, which encompasses most of the new fabrics and silhouettes. And lastly, in regards to our international growth and future goals. We now have 2 stores open in London, our first Asian store in Singapore, and a Middle East partner announced to open our first store in Dubai this fall. As we grow in new markets, we see growing demand for our strong brand. We are on track to expand our global footprint and believe our international business could match and ultimately exceed our overall North American revenues over the long term.  While we continue to see a strengthening of our guest engagement and continued loyalty, there are a couple of discrete external factors that have weighted on our results in the early part of the current quarter, thus impacting our 2015 guidance, namely the challenging weather that we've all seen on the East Coast this year and also the extension of the West Coast port delays into Q1. From the latter point, we are seeing the risks that we identified for Q4 now materializing more than originally anticipated into the initial weeks of Q1. So while these delays proved not to be material in Q4, we are now seeing a more meaningful impact. Stuart will provide more details on these factors in his comments. We are confident that the fundamentals of our business remain healthy as our momentum continues to build. As we move forward into 2015, we remain true to the core values that have made the lululemon brand unique and powerful, an uncompromised commitment to relentless innovation, best-in-class guest experience, exceptional quality, and a vertical model that provides full control. We are also dedicated to managing our business for the long term, and as such, 2015 will be a key year of investment replacing this commitment. We are a growth company, and our vision for growing the business over the long term focuses on extending our brand operating model over genders, categories and geographies to fully unlock the potential for strong and sustainable growth. We have talked about the elements of our brand operating model over the last year, which include our product, our guest experience, and our brand and community. This year, as we have said, we plan to strategically invest in these key areas to fuel the accelerated earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. For product, this investment will include a continued focus on innovation through the expansion of our Whitespace program here at our corporate offices as well as our regional design map; our product pipeline consists of innovative fabrics and technologies that, when married with intelligent, striking design, solve the functional problems for the athletes. Fast Turn is another key capability that allows us to shorten lead times in order to bring innovative, quickly -- innovation quickly to market. By leveraging our cross-functional expertise in design, merchandising and sourcing, we expect Fast Turn will deliver a meaningful portion of our assortment while allowing us to read and capitalize on emerging trends. More specifically with our women's product, in Q2, you will see a significant evolution of our tanks with an emphasis on supporting beauty; and in Q3, we are very excited to bring to life our complete new pant reassortment, which will encompass both fabric and silhouette innovation. Our men's product continues to be focused on function and versatility while expanding the product offering and creating new technical fabric solutions. We remain driven to solve the athlete's training and sport specific needs in the ongoing development of our sweat assortment. As far as guest experience, we continue to invest in initiatives that allow us to create a more personalized and integrated experience with our guests. And while we have always done an outstanding job building strong relationships with our guests in our store, we are in the process of seamlessly connecting these across all guest touch points. To create this capability, we will continue to make key omni-channel investments, leveraging state-of-the-art technology, our global website redesign planned for later this year, and the completion of our RFID implementation, which was originally successfully piloted in 2014. Collectively, this will allow us to have dramatically improved visibility in our on-hand inventory, a deeper knowledge of our guests, which in turn, allows us to build a more intimate experience whenever, wherever and however our guest engages with us. We continue to see significant demand across all geographies. From a store standpoint, we believe our long-term goal of 350 stores in North America will allow us to have the right footprint without oversaturation. In addition to our established showroom model, we are innovating and investing in different store formats that will vary in size and assortment. It is critical to note that we expect this alternative store format to achieve a comparable level of 4-wall profitability compared to the rest of our fleet after initial ramp-up is completed. And lastly, in brand and community, we will build programs to foster and extend the culture that has made lululemon so unique. To this end, in Q2, we plan to launch a 17-city tour aimed at engaging with our store and support center teams as well as our ambassadors to local community-specific experiences in a variety of venues. Building upon the amazing 16 years of history of lululemon, the goal of this tour is to affirm our mission and purpose and declare where our brand is headed. Adding to my earlier comments, we have seen that the true unlocking brand value comes from synchronizing innovative products combined with powerful storytelling and relevance to our guests and the local community. This principle will guide all of our brand investments. Working with our global ambassadors and educators, we aim to inspire, educate, connect and converse with our guests. To emphasize the power of our ambassador community, we recently featured lululemon elite ambassador, Maya Gabeira, big wave surfer, as she explored and surfed in Hawaii. In addition to inspiring footage created for the lululemon website, our team created a mini documentary on Maya, delving deeper into her mindful approach to recovering from a massive life-threatening surf accident. This ambassador-driven campaign, launched alongside a new stream capsule, illustrates how our brand is most powerful when our stories are inspired and generated by our local communities and our local heroes. And as I mentioned, our brand operating model comprised of products, guest experience, and brand and community will be leveraged in an omni-channel manner across diverse geographies to achieve our growth target. Specifically, we will continue to build out North America in 2015 with double-digit square footage growth driven by continued store openings. We will also continue to ramp up our international business with new-store trends in the U.K., Germany, Hong Kong and Singapore in addition to our recently announced partnership in the Middle East with MAF. We are on track to have 20 stores in each region, Asia and Europe, by the end of 2017. 2014 was a pivotal year when we turned the corner and started building positive momentum. In 2015, this cadence will continue and will also be an overlap investment year, where we substantially complete the foundational work already underway to support our long-term growth. And we are building upon our current momentum and made the shift from playing defense to playing offense. With this game plan, we are setting a clear floor to sustainably and profitably grow both within North America and in our global markets. To the entire lululemon collective, thank you for your continued passion and dedication. We are focused on the opportunities ahead in 2015, and I am confident we can deliver on our promise to strengthen and grow our business as we build a global iconic brand. With that, I'd like to turn things over to Stuart, who will outline the financial framework and discipline it will take to meet our near-term and long-term goals. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. It's great to be a part of the team and certainly an exciting time to join lululemon. For those of you on the call, I look forward to meeting you and working with our investment community. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter and 2014, and I'll then update you on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of fiscal 2015. For Q4, total net revenue rose 15.6% to $602.5 million from $521 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in revenue was driven by total comparable sales growth on a combined basis, including e-commerce of 8%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 5% and a 20% growth online, all on a constant-dollar basis. The addition of 48 net new corporate-owned stores since Q4 of 2013, including 32 net new stores in the United States, 1 store in Canada, 1 store in Australia, 1 store in New Zealand, 2 in Europe, 1 in Asia and 10 ivivva stores, and offset with a foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $13.2 million or 2.2%. During the quarter, we opened 13 net new corporate-owned stores, 9 in the U.S., 1 in Australia, 1 in Asia, 1 in Europe and 1 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 302 total stores versus 254 a year ago.  There are now 240 stores in our comp base, 39 of those in Canada, 163 in the United States, 27 in Australia and New Zealand, and 11 ivivva. At the end of Q4, we also have a total of 85 showrooms in operation, 33 lululemon showrooms in North America, 15 internationally and 37 ivivva. Corporate-owned stores represented 75.7% of total revenue or $456.1 million versus 75.9% or $395.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $114.5 million or 19% of total revenues versus $97.8 million or 18.8% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-ups and outlets totaled $31.9 million or 5.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter versus $28 million or 5.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $310 million or 51.5% of net revenue compared to $278.8 million or 53.5% of net revenue in Q4 2013.  The factors which contributed to this 200 basis point decline in gross margin were product margin decline of 50 basis points due to primarily a combination of product sales mix and input costs offset with lower markdowns, 30 basis points due to higher airfreight, 50 basis points due to the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, 40 basis points deleveraged from occupancy and depreciation, and 30 basis points deleveraged from continued investments in our product and supply chain functions.  SG&A expenses were $152.9 million or 25.4% of net revenue compared with $124.6 million or 23.9% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 22.6% SG&A dollar increase is due to the following : an increase in operating expenses associated with new and existing stores, showrooms and outlets, including costs related to our international expansion; increased variable operating cost associated with the growth of our e-commerce business; increases in expenses at our Store Support Centre, including salaries, administrative expenses and professional fees tied to growth and foundational investments; and the anniversary-ing of management incentive compensation reductions in Q4 last year; and foreign exchange gains that, on a net basis, increased SG&A by $4.1 million in Q4 this year. These increases were offset with a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which, on translation, also decreased reported SG&A by $5.3 million or 3.4%. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $157.2 million or 26.1% of net revenue compared with $154.1 million or 29.6% of net revenue in Q4 2013.  Cash expense for the quarter was $48.1 million or a tax rate of 30.3% compared to $46 million or a tax rate of 29.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Net income for the quarter was $110.9 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to net income of $109.7 million or $0.75 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 142.3 million versus 146 million a year ago. This takes into account the weighted impact of 400,000 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $43.30 per share. It's worth noting that we repurchased fewer shares compared to Q3 as we are only active in the market for a small portion of the quarter. Capital expenditures were $30.4 million for the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, for the quarter compared to $34.5 million in the fourth quarter last year. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $664.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $208.1 million or 10.2% higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. Turning to highlights for our full fiscal year 2014 performance. Net revenue rose 12.9% to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013, reflecting 3% comparable sales growth on a constant-dollar basis. E-commerce sales totaled $321.2 million or 17.9% of total sales. Gross profit was $914.2 million or 50.9% of net revenue compared to $840.1 million or 52.8% of net revenue in fiscal 2013. Net income for the year was $239 million or $1.66 per diluted share compared to $279.6 million or $1.91 per diluted share for fiscal 2013.  This is based off an effective tax rate of 37.6%, which includes a $33.7 million tax charge associated with the repatriation of cash from our Canadian subsidiary to our U.S. parent entity to fund our share repurchase program, which had an impact to EPS of $0.23. Excluding this nonrecurring tax charge, diluted EPS would have been $1.89 for the year. This now leads me to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2015. I'd like to start by providing some clarity around the impact of foreign exchange on our financials. Approximately 1/4 of our business is in Canada and Australia, where we saw steep declines in the value of these respective currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter. This reduces our reported revenue in U.S. dollars, and it also compresses our gross margin as our product is purchased in U.S. dollars. These negative factors are then partially offset by lower reported SG&A as the majority of our head office costs are here in Vancouver, Canada. In addition, as the Canadian dollar weakens, we also incur foreign exchange gains on U.S.-denominated cash and receivables in our Canadian subsidiaries. Assuming currencies remain at their prevailing rates, we expect this to have an approximate impact of $65 million to revenue for the 2015 fiscal year, a 60 basis point impact to gross margin offset by a $30 million reduction in SG&A, yielding a net impact to earnings of approximately $0.04 per share when compared to fiscal year 2014. Moving on to Q1. As Laurent mentioned, we had a challenging start to the year as February was externally impacted by both weather and product delivery delays. First, we estimate that weather had an approximate $3 million impact to sales in February and early March due to store closures and lower traffic in the areas that were impacted by the storms. Second, as Laurent also highlighted, while on-time factory handover delivery performance has improved, we have not been able to avoid the delays in ocean shipment times into the West Coast ports. We had previously expected this to impact late Q4 but has shifted into early Q1. We now estimate that the previously identified $10 million in sales risk for Q4 will materialize now in Q1. We also expect these delays to extend into early Q2.  We are otherwise seeing that sell-throughs remain strong, and underlying demand for our product is consistent with what we saw over the holiday period. As a result of these factors discussed, we expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $413 million to $418 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the first quarter of 2014 and assumes CAD 1 at USD 0.79, and 14 new store openings, 8 lululemon stores in North America and 6 ivivva. We anticipate our gross margin in the first quarter to be between 49% to 50%. While we expect merchandise margins to stabilize from last year as we begin to see initial results of our supply chain investments, this will be more than offset by several factors, including the impact of FX from the decline of the Canadian and Australian dollar; higher airfreight, in part due to mitigating the West Coast port delays; deleverage from continued investments in our product engine and in occupancy and depreciation. Specifically with regard to occupancy and depreciation, we expect deleverage in 2015 due to the following : higher lease costs associated with new larger-store formats creating a temporary lag on profitability until these locations ramp up and a more run rate level of sales productivity is achieved; an increase in major renovations and relocations as we reposition and expand certain stores to accommodate our product strategy, such as men's and new categories; international expansion and the amortization of the capital invested in our Columbus DC, which went live last August 2014. We expect SG&A to delever slightly from Q1 2014, a portion due to a higher number of new-store openings and strategic investments.  Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 142.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33 per share. For the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.97 billion to $2.02 billion, which represents an annual combined comp in the mid-single digits. We expect to open 60 corporate-owned stores, which includes up to 8 new stores in Asia, in Europe and also 20 ivivva stores. We expect gross margin for the year to delever from 2014 with merchandise margin stabilizing but more than offset by the factors mentioned in regards to Q1.  We also expect some deleverage in SG&A versus 2014. As Laurent noted, 2015 will reflect the continuation of key investments central to our growth strategies. These include substantially completing foundational systems and process changes while also ramping investments in the areas of guest experience, product innovation, brand and international expansion. It is critical to make these investments now to drive accelerated growth in 2016 and beyond. As a result, we expect operating margin to deleverage from 2014, and our fiscal year 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.90. We estimate that the impact of foreign exchange, weather and port delays will have a collective impact of approximately $0.09 in earnings per share for the fiscal year 2015. This is based off of 142.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q4 2014 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 30.2%. We expect capital expenditures to range between $130 million and $135 million for the fiscal year 2015, reflecting a higher number of new-store openings, renovations and relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments. In closing, I'd like to provide some additional color around our longer-term growth plans. In terms of our revenue, we are targeting long-term comp growth in the mid-single digits along with annual new unit growth that is in line with our 2015 opening plans. In terms of gross margin, we are targeting a recovery to the low to mid-50s range for the total company with North America at the high end of this range and international below this range as this business continues to scale. Our planning assumes modest leverage in SG&A over the long term and operating margin to begin to leverage in 2016 with projected long-term recovery to the low to mid-20s. Our target for North America is to return to the mid-20s with international below this as this business ramps up.  The momentum we are currently seeing in the business results along with the guest response to our early assortment improvements, reaffirms our confidence in our ability to deliver this accelerated growth over the next several years.  With that, I will turn the call back to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Stuart. Before we begin our Q&A session, we would be remiss not to acknowledge the immense contribution of our founder, Chip Wilson, who stepped down from our board last month. It goes without saying that we would not be here today discussing this tremendous business were it not for his vision back in 1998. With that, I'll open up to  questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, welcome. Any initial thoughts, Stuart, on just what you've seen thus far being part of the organization for just a couple months, positive, negative, areas of potential improvement? And also if you could give us maybe a little bit of color around U.S. versus Canada in the quarter. Stuart Haselden : Paul, thanks for the question. So it's exciting to be here. I think that the business has incredible momentum. The investments that the company has been making over the last year seem to be putting the company on track for some explosive growth into the future. The foundation investments we expect will be completed this year, and Tara and her team has done remarkable work. So it's -- I think there's a lot of exciting things in the future for lululemon. So as we -- as to your second question with regards to U.S. versus Canada, what we've seen is sequential improvement clearly end of Q4 in all regions. We saw improvements in all of our geographies in the fourth quarter. The U.S. was clearly stronger than the other geographies that we operate in, but we did see improvements in Canada. In Canada, specifically, we saw a stronger business in the west versus the east in the fourth quarter. That seemed to be continuing into the first quarter, and that's likely related to certain macro factors that are influencing those different areas. But as we focus on our Canadian business and look for ways to continue to drive that business, we have seen some exciting initiatives, and specifically, I call out the work that we've done at our Robson store, our Robson Street store. We did a remodel there last year where we increased the size of the store about 50%. And in the 6 months since the remodel was complete, we've seen traffic and sales increase over 50% in that store, and we've seen our men's business specifically increase over 90%. So we view that as an example and a template for how we might look to pursue similar strategies in other stores in Canada and elsewhere in our chain for that matter. We actually did a similar project at our Santa Monica store in California and have seen a similar outcome in terms of the increase in sales and sales productivity. So we're excited to see those projects, and we're excited to see that as another way we can continue to drive our business. So I think that we're seeing the sequential improvements. Certainly, what has happened in the first quarter in regards to weather and the port delays are impacting both the U.S. and our Canadian businesses, but we're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Welcome, Stuart, as well. I was wondering if we could focus on gross margin just in terms of input costs. You called out 50 basis points, I think, of pressure this quarter from mix as well as input costs. It seems as commodity costs go lower, your input costs would follow. At what point in the year or potentially going forward should we see relief from input costs in margin? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Matt. It's Stuart. So the product margin guidance that we gave -- or the gross margin guidance that we gave does reflect that our expectation -- and we're seeing this in the early part of Q1, that our product margins will stabilize. And what I mean by that is that it should be at least flat. And we are, in fact, seeing that. So that reflects a sequential improvement in those input costs from Q4 into Q1. The pressure that we're seeing and the guidance that we gave around gross margin is really related to the occupancy and depreciation primarily. There are some other factors, FX and also some continued investments in the team and the foundational product engine that the lion's share of that pressure this year is related to that occupancy and depreciation that we called out. And there were -- the discrete factors that we had mentioned in the prepared remarks and, specifically, the larger format stores, some of the major renovations and relocations that are connected to what I just described at our Robson and Santa Monica stores, but it comes with some increase in occupancy and depreciation related to that. We see that as temporary until those stores reach their run rate productivity and a net benefit to the P&L over the long term. And the last thing that was pressuring that occupancy and depreciation was just the Columbus DC investment that we made that now is complete. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Regarding the slowdown, could you just help us understand the nature of the inventory most impacted? And it sounds like you're encouraged for stabilizing your flattish merch margins. So is there any implication there in terms of the slowdown in relation to that? And also as you engage in the variety of the store sizes, which classifications are you going to see more of in the larger format? And which ones might you see less of in the smaller formats? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Oliver. It's Stuart. So the inventory impact from the port delays, it's really -- it's across the board in the inventory flows planned in the early part of Q1. And so what we're seeing is a meaningful portion of the inventory for the quarter has been delayed up to 3 weeks, and there's a smaller portion that's been delayed beyond that time frame. So it's affecting the spring flows that we had planned and even some of the late winter flows. So we're working hard with the -- our merchant teams are working hard to optimize inventory that we have and get ready for those flows that we expected to come earlier when they do hit the stores so that we can be well positioned from a marketing and an educator standpoint so that we're able to make the most of it. To your other questions, in terms of the merch margin impact, it certainly affects the merch margin. I feel, at this point, we're not backing away from the guidance that we gave. We feel we'll be able to work through these issues and still deliver that stabilized merch margin for the year. And that picture is benefiting from a lot of work that Tara and her team have done over the last year, and we're starting to see the fruits of that work. And then for your last question in regards to the store sizes and formats, so we continue to test and experiment new formats. We're seeing the potential for expanded store footprints, particularly, as we have a growing men's business that we're now working to ensure that we're presenting that in the strongest manner and making sure we have enough space to accommodate the experiences in a high-quality way. So it's going to be market by market. We'll look for flagship-type locations where it makes sense. Otherwise, we'll test expanded formats where we see the potential demand. And again, it's really a trade area and market-driven exercise. And then we'll also continue to roll out the ivivva stores we mentioned. Laurent Potdevin : And Oliver, again, it's Laurent. As far as the multistore format, I mean, we'll play with larger format, I mean, areas where it makes sense. We might also play with smaller store formats if you think about resorts, whether it's at the beach or in the mountains. And with our enhanced stability to look at localized assortment and really leverage omni-channel, I mean, we'll look at different formats around the world. But what's really important is that we look at the same level of profitability 4-wall contribution from all of those formats. Oliver Chen : We've been pretty thrilled of what we've been seeing in stores. On your comment, Laurent, on the tanks, is there -- just broadly speaking, what's the degree of newness or the nature of the real innovation opportunity for the Q2 tanks story? Laurent Potdevin : I'll let Tara talk about tanks. I think it's a lot more appropriate. Tara Poseley : So for Q2, stepping back to 2014, our goal was to stabilize the business. And as we're moving into 2015, you've heard me talk about this a few times, really making sure function and beauty is consistently across assortment. Quarter-by-quarter, you're going to -- we'll continue to see improvement in that. Q2, what we've really focused on the tank wall. That was our second -- last year, we started tackling the pant wall. Q2 is about tackling the tank block. You're going to see a better balance of support options in the tanks, which has really been lacking. So we're adding 4 new styles with medium support. And then by Q3, we'll be adding a full support tank. So also not only addressing the technical piece of the tank, we're going to be addressing the beauty. And we have always owned exquisite design in our tank wall, and we are aggressively returning to those roots. From an innovation standpoint, you'll see more innovation in tanks as we move into 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura Securities. Kevin Heenan : This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on showroom performance internationally. Laurent Potdevin : The showroom has continued to perform incredibly well. And we've actually seen an acceleration of our performance in Germany, and we continue to perform really well in Asia. And we're opening a couple showrooms soon in Sweden. So it's still a very, very powerful and nimble way for us to enter the market and to enter communities. And we see the performance continuing to increase. As we look -- as we sort of reengineer the assortment, given the higher level of brand awareness that we see in the new regions that -- or the new markets that we're entering. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So traffic was positive in the fourth quarter. You spoke to continued momentum that you're seeing. Can you just talk a little bit about the underlying traffic thus far in the first quarter maybe in less weather-impacted areas but more so also, your comfort with inventory on hand today? And when do you think the store will be fully set to capture the conversion opportunity? Stuart Haselden : Matt, it's Stuart. So on your traffic question, so we continued to see strong traffic into Q1. So the traffic acceleration that we saw late in 2014 has continued into Q1. Conversion has improved sequentially. It's still been a headwind for us. We've seen some slight improvement in AUR as well. So we're encouraged by the traffic, and we look to that as an indicator that the momentum that we had in the fourth quarter is, in fact, extending into Q1. And we're working through the inventory issues, as you mentioned, which is really the bigger headwind for us currently. We feel as -- the inventory will begin to rebalance likely in Q2 and will more normalize -- the flows will hopefully more normalize into the second half of the year. But nonetheless, we're responding to our new expectations for when we expect to receive inventory so that we're well positioned to make the most of it. So in terms of the amount of inventory we have, we're comfortable with both the increase -- the level of increase and the composition, the health of that inventory. So we're comfortable with that. I'm going to pause there and ask you to repeat your last question. Matthew Boss : More so just how we should think about inventory versus sales as the year progresses in order to really capture that conversion opportunity. Stuart Haselden : Sure. Yes. I think over the long term, we expect to maintain a very disciplined posture in terms of our inventory investments versus our top line revenue. But given some of the disruptions that we've seen this year with regard to the supply chain, you may see some point-in-time anomalies where that relationship may become disconnected. But again, we're confident that as we plan the business for this year and into next year, we will ensure that we maintain that discipline and the relationship between the inventory position and our sales momentum. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Yruma from KeyBanc. Edward Yruma : I know you mentioned markdowns were down in the fourth quarter. I guess embedded in your guidance for gross, how should we think about markdowns? And I guess just as a bigger-picture question, any thoughts, Stuart, on kind of clearance philosophies? I know you guys have used warehouse sales. You've done some select broken size run sales in stores. How can you best optimize your markdown strategy? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Ed. Yes, so the markdowns into Q1 versus Q4 and versus last year, rather, we see it as a similar level of markdowns. We may opportunistically run some markdown activities to take advantage of our inventory position. And more recently, we actually ran an event earlier this week that was really an opportunistic chance for us to drive some traffic to the store to get clean on some of the late winter inventory flows that were reaching our stores now so that we're ensure -- we're ensuring we're in a clear place for the spring flows that are in the pipeline. And so it really should not put us measurably different year-over-year from a markdown standpoint. It was really small in terms of the overall percentage of the sales and inventory for the quarter and really not a departure from things we've done in the past. We've been doing similar programs for several years. So no concerns with regard to markdowns. Overall, similar posture to last year, and we'll continue to leverage that. In terms of your other question around the clearance philosophy, I mean, it's -- I can tell you versus other places I've worked, this is a remarkably full-priced business. It's a very powerful brand. We do not drive our business with markdowns, and it's remarkably healthy in that regard. So I think where we choose to do markdown activity, it's really purely aimed at liquidation and getting the inventory in the position we want it to be. The warehouse sales you mentioned have been wildly successful I think because of that strong full-priced position of the brand. And so we'll continue to evaluate where and when to do those, but it's really -- it's not part of the business model in terms of driving sales with markdowns. And we don't have plans to introduce that going forward. Laurent Potdevin : I mean, Ed, this is Laurent. I mean, you've heard us speak for over a year now about scarcity strategy. And obviously, we've been more scarce this past year than we'd like to be. But we're very focused on continuing [ph] to be scarce and driving business with very high sales for at full retail. And there might be categories in very narrow selection of the product where we're going to go deeper to really understand the full potential of our opportunities, especially as it relates to men's. Operator : And our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Janney Capital Market. Adrienne Tennant : Welcome, Stuart. Tara, my question is for you. Are you at the targeted level of seasonal versus core basic? How much of the product would you say is sort of in those 2 buckets? And then were you pleased with the in-stock positions for holiday in that seasonal product? Quickly for Stuart. You did give the comp sales per square foot, $1,678. Could you give it for total? And then would you break down comps by U.S. and Canada? Tara Poseley : As for the question about core versus seasonal, really our focus is on giving the guest a beautiful assortment, whether it be from seasonal or from core. So there's work going against all of those areas of the business. We talked about our efforts against the pant wall as well as the tank wall and for bringing beauty and function back to all of our product assortments. And those strategies hit all buckets of our inventory, whether it be core or seasonal. So our in-stock positions around seasonal in Q4, we were fine with that. Of course, we had some areas that were runaway successes. But again, referring to Laurent's comments about scarcity model, it's a really important part of this brand. And we'll continue to go forward, making sure that we are coveting that because it is really something that makes us special. Laurent Potdevin : As you recall, some of our discussions at ICR, I mean, we've had some of the same successes with some of our core assortment. So really, it's not about a core or seasonal. That discussion needs to go away. I mean, it's really going be driven by the guests, and in different parts of the world, we're going to be seeing different mix with different maturity of the brand but [indiscernible] it's going to be equally as strong and as profitable in both categories. Adrienne Tennant : Great. And Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Sure. Yes, Adrienne. I think you have the -- what we disclosed around the sales per square foot and where we landed for Q4. The comps were strong across the business in the fourth quarter. We saw stronger comps in the U.S. versus Canada, but we saw sequential improvements in both geographies. So we're not going to break down the specifics by region. But suffice it to say, we are encouraged by the results that we saw in all of our geographies, Canada and the U.S. included. Operator : And our final question for today comes from Howard Tubin from Guggenheim. Howard Tubin : Maybe, Laurent, can you just update us on your thoughts on the overall competitive environment and whether you think it's changed recently? And if so, has it impacted or not your business? Laurent Potdevin : Howard, I mean, I've answered that question many, many times. I mean, I think that we've got -- the overall market globally is growing. And the strengths and the number of competitors really validate the long-term growth and size of the market. But we either compete against everybody or we compete against nobody. I mean, we own the market that we created. And we have second-to-none products and guest experience. And our vertical model really allows us to create experiences that are unique. So I really look at ourselves as being in a very unique position, and we're going to continue to lead as the premium segment of the market in distribution that we control. So I feel very good that with investments that we're making in innovation, in products, in guest experience as well as in brand and community, we're going to continue to lead the market, and the competitors will come as the market gets healthier. Operator : Thank you. Now I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may, all, disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now turn the call over to your host, Chris Tham, Senior Vice President of Finance. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; Stuart Haselden, CFO; along with Tara Poseley, our Chief Product Officer, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information which we have assessed, but which by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I will turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter performance as well as give you an update on our progress with the key strategic initiatives planned for 2015. Stuart will then walk you through our financials and guidance in more detail. We delivered strong results in our first quarter despite headwinds from weather, port-related delays and foreign exchange impact. Specifically, we delivered first quarter revenues above the high end of our guidance, generating overall comparable sales growth of 6%, driven in part by a 31% increase in our e-commerce channel. Within our North American business, we saw another quarter of positive combined comps and a nice acceleration in our e-commerce business in both the U.S. and Canada. Our women's business once again delivered positive comps in the quarter, driven by our bottoms category. Our guests responded well to our assortment in the quarter, despite the impact of product flows coming out of the port disruption. We have seen an acceleration in our business in the latter part of the quarter as our inventory positions began to improve, validating our new product flow and assortment. Additionally, we saw further ramp in our men's business, delivering a 19%  comp, and finally, ivivva delivered a 29% comp on a combined basis. We achieved this growth across our key categories despite the challenges related to the West Coast port disruptions. We look forward to seeing how our guests respond in Q2 and through the second half of the year when our product assortments are properly balanced by season and in quantity. We ended the first quarter with elevated inventory level as a result of the port-related delays. However, we are finally reaching better in-stock positions and are confident in our plans to work through this inventory with no impact on brand equity and minimal markdown risk. Stuart will provide additional color on this during his remarks. Before getting into further details on the quarter, I would like to pause and offer my sincere gratitude to Delaney Schweitzer, who left lululemon at the end of last month after 13 years with our collective. Under her leadership, Delaney developed incredible leaders, and as a result, we have a deep bench of talent poised to lead our global retail business. We are empowering these leaders to oversee the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. Collectively, our retail leadership team brings history, experience, passion and commitment to our culture. Their energy will inspire our people and fuel our growth. Our expansion into international markets continue to be a key growth driver. In Asia, we opened our second store in Singapore at Takashimaya shopping center on May 13 and have already seen fantastic results well ahead of our expectations. Additionally, our initial store in Ion mall continues to outperform our plan, and we are eagerly anticipating the opening of our first Hong Kong store at ifc mall, which we expect to be amongst our most productive stores across our global portfolio. We also have plans to open a second store in Hong Kong in Q3 in Hysan Place located in the heart of Causeway Bay. Last but not least, we are on track to open our first store in Dubai in Q3 of this year. On our last call, I outlined both our short- and long-term goals as a growth company, building a global iconic brand across geographies and new categories, and we continue to make strategic investments in the key elements of our brand operating model : one, our product; two, our guest experience; and three, our brand and community. Beginning with product, we continue to see the benefits of the ongoing work on our product engine connected within Tara's group. Our design ecosystem is leveraging our culture of innovation, and we are achieving this by expanding our design organization and through our relentless focus on functional innovation. A key component of this process is the deep relationship and feedback loop we have built with our ambassador [ph] community. Our ambassadors are real-life inspirational leaders in their communities who live the sweat life to its full extent, 365 days a year. They are an integral part of the product development process. Our ambassadors sweat in our product then give us valuable feedback to assist our whitespace R&D group. They truly love being a part of our early product design cycle, and we are always looking at new ways to deepen this aspect of our relationship with them. Turning to some specific product highlights from the last quarter. We saw continued momentum in our women's pants business. Our earlier work to reinvigorate this key category continues to pay off. As an example, our wunder under franchise is performing extremely well, especially with the addition of new styles over last year. These strong positive signals bode very well for the relaunch of our pant wall expected [ph] in Q3. And our tank line is evolving as well with the introduction of higher-support construction, more diverse coverage options and a wider selection of fits. This initial new offerings are hitting our stores in late Q2 and into Q3, and we look forward to creating the same level of excitement and energy with our tanks as we did with our bottoms. These efforts will continue to inform the full relaunch of the tank wall in the first half of 2016. We are thrilled to see the accelerated momentum in the men's business as evidenced by its 19% comp, and we have expanded option within popular categories, including our Metal Vent tech T-shirts, which further reinforced the strong growth of our foundational sweat business. We are also experimenting with different store formats and shopping experiences aimed at our male guests. The Joinery, currently found in our men's SoHo store in New York and Robson store in Vancouver, allows a personalized experience where guys can customize the function of their shorts on the spot. The concept of The Joinery is firmly rooted in a function-first approach, letting men craft their own workout gear. Creating an authentic best-in-class guest experience is the second key area of investment. We continued to strengthen our omni-channel capabilities with projects targeting improvement both in-store and online. For example, our website is undergoing a full global redesign to ensure we have a scalable transactional platform that will allow us to showcase a broader assortment of product online, better enable product storytelling and deepen our product education capabilities. Some key features will include enhancement to the checkout process and targeted recommendations, while ensuring the site is optimized across any device. Phase 1 will launch in the latter part of this year and prior to holidays. The final key area of investment for this year is within our brand community efforts. We continue to see the highest engagement with our guests when we powerfully tell our product stories in a way that is locally relevant for them. As I mentioned earlier, we recognize and embrace the power of our ambassador community, and this past quarter, we hosted 130 of them from around the world at our annual ambassador summit in Whistler, British Columbia. Our goal for this year's summit was to intentionally deepen the integration between our local educators, our support center team, whitespace and our global ambassador community. And just last week, just last Friday actually, in Vancouver, we kicked off a 16-city global tour, where we will connect with many facets of our collective, including our educators, store support teams and ambassadors. Our educators absolutely never cease to amaze me. They are the best at what they do and hold the most important job within the company. They create authentic connections with our guests by listening to their passions, understanding their needs and how they like to sweat, and most importantly, encouraging them in studying, pursuing and celebrating their goals. This, too, is one way to express our gratitude and connect with thousands of our educators and ambassadors around the globe. Our brand lives within our people, and during the tour, we will reaffirm our mission and create our future together. In conclusion, lululemon is a powerful and unique brand, and our core values will continue to guide our future. Our business model gives us full control of the experiences we are creating, and we are relentless in our pursuit of innovation in everything that we do, resulting in unparalleled guest loyalty. We have made the shift from playing defense to playing offense, and we have set a course of sustainable and profitable growth both within North America and in our global market. Before turning the call over to Stuart, I would like to express my gratitude to the entire lululemon collective who makes up our iconic brand. It is our combined passion and commitment that will allow us to capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead. I'll now turn things over to Stuart for a more thorough review of our financial results and guidance. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our first quarter in 2015, and then I'll update you on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year of fiscal 2015. For Q1, total revenue rose 10.1% to $423.5 million from $384.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in revenue was driven by total comparable sales growth on a combined basis, including e-commerce of 6%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales decrease of 1%; and a 31% growth online, all on a constant-dollar basis; also, square footage growth of 21.8% versus last year, driven by the addition of 53 net new company-operated stores since Q1 of 2014, 35 net new stores in the United States, 2 stores in Canada, 1 store in New Zealand, 1 in Europe, 1 in Asia and 13 ivivva stores. This was offset by both the impact of the West Coast port disruption, as we indicated during our Q4 call, and the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, the latter of which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $15.2 million or 3.6%. During the quarter, we opened 14 net new company-operated stores, 6 in the U.S., 1 in Canada and 7 ivivva. We entered the quarter with 316 total stores versus 263 a year ago. There are now 240 stores in our comp base, 39 of those in Canada, 158 in the United States, 27 in Australia and New Zealand, 1 in Europe and 15 ivivva. At the end of Q1, we also have a total of 86 showrooms in operation, 34 of lululemon showrooms in North America, 15 internationally and 37 ivivva.  Company-operated stores represented 74.2% of total revenue or $314.1 million versus 74.9% or $288.1 million in the first quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $83.6 million or 19.7% of total revenue versus $66 million or 17.3% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-ups and outlets, totaled $25.8 million or 6.1% of revenue for the first quarter versus $30.5 million or 7.9% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. Gross profit for the first quarter was $205.9 million or 48.6% of net revenue compared to $195.7 million or 50.9% of net revenue in Q1 2014. The factors which contributed to this 230 basis point decline in gross margin were : a 100 basis point of deleverage due to higher airfreight costs incurred primarily to mitigate the West Coast port delays. It should be noted that the market for airfreight in Q1 was highly competitive and rates and surcharges increased significantly toward the end of the quarter; 70 basis points deleverage due to foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar; 30 basis points deleverage from continued strategic investments in our product and supply chain functions; and 130 basis points deleverage from occupancy and depreciation, consistent with our guidance from last quarter. This was mostly due to higher lease costs associated with larger store formats and increase in major renovations and relocations and our international expansion. These items were offset with 100 basis points of improvement in our product margins over prior year. SG&A expenses were $137.8 million or 32.5% of net revenue compared with $125.9 million or 32.7% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 9.4% SG&A dollar increase is due to the following : an increase in operating expenses associated with new and existing stores, showrooms and outlets, including costs related to our international expansion; increased variable operating costs associated with the growth in our e-commerce business; and higher foreign exchange losses from the revaluation of monetary assets in our foreign subsidiaries. These increases were offset with a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which, on translation, also decreased reported SG&A by $8.4 million or 6%. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $68 million or 16.1% of net revenue compared with $69.8 million or 18.2% of net revenue in Q1 of 2014. Tax expense for the quarter was $20.8 million or a tax rate of 30.3% compared to $52.5 million or a tax rate of 73.4% in the first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, last year's tax expense in the first quarter included the impact of the decision to repatriate cash from our Canadian subsidiary to our U.S. parent company to fund the share repurchase program, which triggered a tax charge of $30.9 million in Q1 of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $47.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to net income of $19 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2014. This includes the year-over-year negative net impact from foreign currency of $0.03 per share versus our expectations of $0.01 per share impact. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 142.3 million versus 145.9 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 300,000 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $66.51 per share. Capital expenditures were $27.9 million for the quarter compared to $25.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $655.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $236.5 million or 31% higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2014. Late product deliveries as a result of the West Coast port issues elevated our inventory levels on hand and in transit at the end of the quarter. These late Q1 deliveries will combine with on-time deliveries in Q2 as our supply chain cadence normalizes, and as a result, our inventories will remain elevated for the next couple of quarters. Compounding the year-over-year comparison for Q2 is the fact that we were significantly under-inventoried for Q2 of last year, with essentially a 0 build in stock levels from Q1. All that being said, we are glad to now be in a strong in-stock position and have identified a number of strategies to work through these elevated product levels that will minimize markdown risk. Specifically, this is great product, and we have identified opportunities to reflow approximately 2/3 of this late-arriving inventory into our second half assortments at full price, with little incremental markdown risk. The remaining 1/3 of these late arrivals will be sold down through our normal exit channels, which include our outlet stores, online warehouse sales and physical warehouse sales. This now leads me to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year of 2015. As Laurent mentioned, it has been good to see our comps accelerate at the end of Q1 and into the first 5 weeks of Q2 as our inventory position improved. In particular, we have seen a strong guest response through our new spring and summer products. And with continuing momentum, our Canadian stores are now seeing a positive comp sales trend in Q2, driven in part by higher conversion. And likewise, our U.S. stores are also posting a strong comp store sales trend in the initial weeks of the quarter. As a result, we are -- we now expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $440 million to $445 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the high single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2014 and assumes a Canadian dollar at $0.80 to the U.S. dollar and 18 new store openings : 13 lululemon stores and 5 ivivva. We anticipate our gross margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 48% to 49%. As we had discussed last quarter, we continue to expect to see merchandise margin stabilize and strengthen relative to last year, with offsets in foreign exchange, deleverage from continued investments in our product and supply chain functions and store occupancy and depreciation. Airfreight costs will remain a headwind in Q2 before abating in the second half of the year. We expect SG&A in the second quarter to delever slightly from Q2 of 2014. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and a 142.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion. We remain on plan to open 60 company-operated stores, which includes up to 8 new stores in Asia and Europe and also 20 ivivva stores. We expect gross margin for the year to delever from 2014, with merchandise margin stabilizing, but more than offset by the factors we mentioned earlier. We expect some deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2014, driven by continued strategic investments in guest experience, our website, brand and our IT systems. We now expect a net impact to earnings from foreign exchange for the year to increase from approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share when compared to fiscal year 2014. As a result, we expect operating margin to deleverage from 2014 and our fiscal year 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.86 to $1.91 per share. This is based off of 142.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q1 of 2015 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 30.2%.  We expect capital expenditures to range between $130 million to $135 million for the fiscal year 2015, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain investments. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Courtney Willson : This is Courtney in for Oliver today. Could you just update us on what you're seeing in terms of raw materials going forward? And then also just any update on your mobile strategy. Stuart Haselden : Courtney, it's Stuart. Sure. On raw materials, we are seeing the benefits from our go-to-market calendar accrued to the cost that we're seeing for raw materials. We're also seeing some of the costs related to raw materials are continuing to be consistent with what we've seen previously. I'm going to invite Tara to add anything to that, if there is anything. Tara Poseley : No, I think you answered that well, Stuart. Thank you. Stuart Haselden : So I think the bigger point really is just as we continue to make progress on the go-to-market calendar and the strategies related there, we should see benefits in the input costs really more from how we are able to better synchronize our supply chain activities and generate better leverage and how we are able to engage and negotiate with our vendors, and that will benefit a number of different areas, raw materials included. On your -- on the question on mobile, I'm going to let Laurent speak to that one. Laurent Potdevin : So on the mobile, maybe I mentioned that in our earlier script, we're doing a full global web redesign that obviously is going to be mostly driven by -- the development is driven by mobile and will be adapted to all sort of devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum with our mobile performance, and so it will be an integral part of our growth, doing with -- the web redesign. And we are adding tremendous talent to the digital team. So we are very excited with what we are seeing. Combined with our new account capture and our CRM efforts, we've got a very large collective that's building very quickly. So mobile is a very integral part of our strategy and how we are not only transacting, but also doing our storytelling with our ambassadors. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : Can you just speak to the cadence of the comps as the quarter progressed? I know you spoke to things getting better toward the end. And then just drivers of the positive inflection that you saw in conversion. And more so, as you think about the positive store comp quarter to date, what's driven that? What should we keep an eye open for in stores today? Stuart Haselden : Matt, so yes, on the comp -- in Q1, so we saw it track closely with our inventory positions, and obviously, that was related -- or is impacted by what happened with the West Coast port issues. What we saw since the -- since we last spoke in the March earnings call, we did see our comps improve as our spring and summer product landed in April. It's worth mentioning that when we did give guidance, the expectation was that we would see our spring and summer goods land closer to the beginning of April. They actually landed more into the middle of April. But what we were surprised was -- what we were surprised by was the fact that our winter and holiday goods that we had in the first part of April to a higher mix as a result of the delays in the spring, summer timing, the winter and holiday product performed better than expected from a sell-through standpoint. That product does have a lower product margin inherently, and so that weighed on the overall margin outcome and explains part of the miss to the margin guidance that we had given. The other thing we were surprised by in the last part of the quarter was the airfreight costs came in about 30% to 40% higher than expected. And that also weighed on margins in the quarter and was -- that cost was above what we originally expected when we gave guidance. But for the comp specifically, we did see a nice acceleration as our in-stock positions improved. That acceleration was more or less a reflection of an increase in conversion. The traffic over the course of the quarter was relatively consistent, and we saw as in-stock positions improved, conversion improved, comps improved. We saw that continue into the first part of the second quarter as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, and it's a similar story. We are seeing some continued acceleration in our Canadian traffic, and specifically, along with the improved conversion. So it's an improving picture. It's very closely connected to the improving in-stock positions that we have. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up. On the merchandise margin front, can you just talk about opportunities in the second half? And then more so, if you could just help rank the drivers of gross margin expansions as we move into next year, I think that would be really helpful. Stuart Haselden : Sure. I think as we look at the second half of the year from a margin standpoint, the guidance that we gave around the improved sales really relates to that 1/3 of the inventory -- the elevated inventory levels that we'll be looking to exit in the balance of the year. We have assumed that those sales will essentially have -- from an exit standpoint, the cost to exit those sales will essentially wash with the incremental margin that they'll generate. There may be some upside to that assumption, but we're not ready to call it at this point. So if I was to try to point to margin opportunities in the second half, it's probably just how effective we can be in moving through that elevated inventory position. And from a gross margin expansion standpoint, I think your question is more getting at the outlook into next year and the benefits of the activities and investments that we're making this year, particularly in Tara's group. I think, as we had said previously, we expect the go-to-market calendar to be able to help us reduce our fabric liability cost as we get more efficient in how we actually are able to synchronize the supply chain we'll have less waste effectively. And that will reduce the amount of fabric liability that we'll need to have in order to deliver the same amount of product. Additionally -- and that's probably the first and foremost part of the gross margin opportunity as we think about that go-to-market calendar strategy. We also have a fair amount of expedited airfreight costs both into the production cycle to help us stay on track with our calendar, and then we have expedited airfreight costs out of the production cycle with finished goods to help us stay on track with our inventory flow cycle. So again, as our calendar becomes more synchronized, we'll be able to eliminate and reduce -- or at least materially reduce this airfreight cost. So I'd say those are the top parts of that go-to-market calendar margin opportunity. Certainly, there are other things that we're doing that will benefit just the flow and how we're able to -- from a fast turn standpoint, be able to respond to trends that we see in the market. That's a smaller part of the equation today that we're investing in to try to grow that and make it more meaningful. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital. Edward Yruma : I guess just first, I know you've been testing a lot of different formats for men's. I guess as you think about going-forward growth, should we expect more separate doors? Is it more kind of a sidecar? And then I guess, as a follow-up, I know you talked a lot about inventory, but free cash generation was negative for the first time in some time. How should we think about free cash flow going forward? Laurent Potdevin : On the men's side of the business, I mean, we've obviously been very, very excited with playing with different formats, whether it's stand-alone store, whether it's increased square footage in some of our current stores or some expanded format. I mean the one format that we are most excited right now about is expanded store where both men's and women's are co-located as our female guest still shops a lot for him. I mean he does -- our male guest does have a lot more permission to come into the lululemon collective, but she still shops a lot for him. So the expanded format, co-located format is one that we're seeing tremendous results with. And we'll continue in the right geographies, right cities, we'll continue to play with potential stand-alone stores as we see fit, as long as it's in very close proximity to the women's location, such as what you can experience in SoHo. Stuart Haselden : And Ed, on your second question on the cash flow, we were more aggressive in the quarter with the share repurchase program, which that tipped us negative, as you pointed out. But we still feel very good about the cash flow generation in this business and feel that we'll be in a good liquidity position going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Stuart, on the full year comp guide for -- guidance for mid-single digits, I was just wondering how to think about that in terms of you just put up a 6% increase in the first quarter and your guidance for 2Q was high single digits. So the deceleration embedded in the guidance for the second half, just want to parse that out a bit. Could you talk to that? Stuart Haselden : Matt, yes. So the guidance in the second half, from a comp sales standpoint, as you look under the covers, the range, we essentially -- the forecast that we used for the basis of the guidance showed that the comp results would increase into the top end of that range. So we're essentially, in our model, on the cusp of a mid to beginning to close in on a high single digit. So it's really just a question of where we fell in that range of mid-single digit comps. We aren't ready yet to call more upside for the second half. So internally, we feel like the data points connect, and it doesn't necessarily suggest deceleration. It's just the current view in Q2, we have more clarity given where we are right now, and we're more comfortable calling that. But it's really, I would say, from where we were in the March call, we're just higher into that -- the upper end of that mid-single-digit range on the comps. Matthew McClintock : And then if I could follow up. Laurent or Tara, could you speak to some of the new product that you launched in second quarter? Clearly, there's been strong response. But I was wondering if we could talk a little bit in more detail about when women's tops and specifically, swim, now that that's a new category for you. Tara Poseley : So what we -- obviously, the spring goods didn't get in until April, but we saw really strong positive response from the guests. Particularly, the bottom trend continues and bodes well for our pant wall relaunch in Q3. Our efforts against tanks, we'll start seeing lot of the new styles and new work there begins to get into stores starting the end of Q2. So we'll have more to come on that, that we can talk to. It's a little too early on that. And we've been very pleased with swim. We have more opportunity to add additional coverage offers -- offerings in swim. So we've had some good [indiscernible] in spring, but the guest response has been really positive, and we can see more upside opportunity as we move into designing next year for swim in '16. Operator : Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Janney Capital. Adrienne Tennant : Congratulations on the product progress. Well done. Tara, my question is on the 2/3 of the product that is going to kind of live beyond the second quarter. Can you talk about the composition of that product, long top, long bottom or more core? And then how much is men's versus women's? And then on the 1/3 that is going to be moved through the different channels, did you -- do you feel that you have sufficient inventory to run the September -- I guess, was it September or July and January warehouse sales? And can you remind us if you ran them last year? Tara Poseley : Okay. Yes, the composition of the 2/3 product, what the buying teams have done is we've reflowed the spring product into summer and then looked at the summer product that we could flow into fall. And the teams are really excited actually with the product they want flow into fall. Plus that the addition of the color in August, which is really still high summer, into our fall merchandise was a good choice. Our fourth quarter product hasn't been placed yet, so it gives us a lot of movement to shift some of the core receipts that we needed to reflow from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. So I'm feeling really good about composition of that 2/3. We did have -- we had an online warehouse sale last year in October. We're actually going to move that forward into Q2 to clear through the holiday inventory. Stuart did mention that we actually saw good guest response to the holiday inventory that we had kept up at regular price in our stores in February and March. And we'll be using our warehouse sales to clear through that, probably that 1/3 that we're talking about. And then we will then make choices through the remainder of the year if we do some additional pop-ups to warehouse or just use our regular outlets to move through that inventory. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Alexander with BB&T Capital Markets. Paul Alexander : Can you talk about the 31% increase in direct-to-consumer? How sustainable is a growth rate like that? And was it inflated in first quarter by people who couldn't get to the store when weather was really bad or by people who couldn't find what they wanted in stores because of the port slowdown? And what kind of impact on the 2Q direct-to-consumer growth rate should we see from the movement of that warehouse sale from October into Q2? Stuart Haselden : Paul, so yes, the -- we're very pleased with the e-com sales growth that we saw in Q1. I'd say there's a couple of factors we'd point to. Certainly, weather was an issue in the early part of Q1, which likely benefited the e-commerce results. I'd also say that we began the quarter in e-commerce with a stronger inventory position, and we were able to accelerate -- or able to flow, I should say, inventory to the e-commerce business faster than we could the stores. There's an additional step in the supply chain for getting the inventory from our distribution centers to our stores, which takes a little bit of time, that in e-commerce, you don't have that step. So we're able to have a better inventory position in e-commerce, which I think drove the upside. And from a -- the comp guidance that we gave for Q2 certainly reflects an ongoing strength in our e-commerce business as well as the improvement in the store comps. So there's nothing that we would look at from a direct standpoint that would suggest that the increases that we saw in the first quarter is not sustainable. We wouldn't necessarily plan it at that level, but there's nothing structural that would prevent us from delivering that type of an outcome going forward. Laurent Potdevin : And Paul, especially when you consider all the enhancements from a CRM account and checkout standpoint that we're putting into the global web redesign and our educators at the store level have done an outstanding job, but we've done a good job training them, and they've done an outstanding job using our bag backroom app [ph], which has really been able to leverage our online inventory when we haven't had inventory in stores. So that's really sort of our strategy coming together from that standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : I guess, 2 questions, one on Canada. I'm very glad to hear about the positive comps there. I think it's been a while. I know it's your most mature productive stores. Can you maybe give us more color on what you're doing in Canada as far as remodels, men's, product? What's taking hold there? And then on the international stores, maybe some comments on where are you on building your team out? What kind of lead times are you seeing for store leases, learnings from early stores on pricing? Anything that could just help us give more comfort on the international store rollout and what you've seen so far? Laurent Potdevin : Yes. We're very -- we've been very focused on Canada as one of our -- as our first market, and it's been really coming across the 3 sort of key pillars of what we do, right? I mean, we focus a lot on educator training. We very much focus on the buy, how wide the buy is and the depth of the buy, and we're seeing tremendous results with that. And our brand community groups have really focused on how to have a campaign that is very -- I mean, I hate the word campaign, but programs that were very much dedicated to Canada. And we've seen tremendous impact there. I think another interesting market to look at where we have been challenged is Australia. And I was in Australia a month ago, spending time with our team there. And we've seen the same type of return to very healthy comps simply by focusing on those markets; the buy, the training and brand and community efforts that are locally relevant, but especially in the context of Australia, really focusing on ambassadors that are relevant to Australia. So we think about triathletes, surfers that are training in environments that are hotter, more humid, obviously they have to deal with a lot more sun than we do here in Vancouver, and using this market as testing ground for new product. So just really product, buy, brand and community and training focused on those markets has really paid off in a very significant way. Brian Tunick : And then on the international side? Laurent Potdevin : And on the international side -- sorry, I knew there was a second part to that question. On the international side, I mean, we're very much on track. I mean, like, we're exceeding our expectations both in Asia and in Europe. As I mentioned, we're on track opening Dubai in September. We're probably seeing -- we're exceeding to a greater extent in Asia than in Europe. So that's probably suggest the ability to maybe accelerate a little bit our expansion in Europe, and we've just opened a showroom in Seoul that is performing extremely, extremely well. So an opportunity to do more in Asia with an awesome team, and in Europe, like, keeping the course but yet still very much exceeding our expectations. So opening a showroom in France. We've just opened a showroom in Stockholm. We've relocated a showroom in Germany in Berlin. That's now performing at a level that sort of suggests a store rollout. So very, very happy with the pace and the success of the international expansion so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Howard Tubin with Guggenheim Securities. Howard Tubin : Maybe just a question for Tara. Can you just update us on where you stand on your chase capabilities and how quickly you can get back into things within season? Tara Poseley : I think you said our chase capabilities? Howard Tubin : Yes. Tara Poseley : Sorry, okay. You cut off for a second there. So we have established a fast-turn team that can turn goods in about -- depending on if we have taken position on the fabric or we have liable fabric, that team can turn products around in roughly 2.5 months. So it's a great mechanism for us to leverage as we see where sales are and be able to chase them into core products or as well into seasonal fashion ideas as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Jim Duffy : More questions around the international opportunities. Are you yet in a position to talk directionally about store models for international markets, how it may differ between Asia and Europe? And what are some of the key differences in format and economics you expect versus North America? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Jim. So the strategy at this point in the early store openings is focused on capital cities in those geographies, in Western Europe and in Asia. So these are some of the most productive retail centers or retail areas in the world, and so these initial store locations are -- they're rivaling some of the best stores in North America, from a sales standpoint, from a sales per square foot standpoint and also from a 4-wall profit. The -- obviously, the rent dynamics are different. We're seeing higher rents. We're having to pay key money in certain markets, but these are sort of the -- some of the most productive locations you can imagine. So we're really -- we're picking the cherries, so to speak, in the initial phase to establish the brand. It's important to have a very visible location in these key areas, these key cities in the shopping areas within them so that you establish the brand in a manner that's consistent with how we want it to be established. So we need to build that presence and that brand recognition with the store footprint. But we're -- it's not a marketing activity. These stores are very profitable and on a 4-wall basis, very attractive. Obviously, you have the cost -- the overhead cost of investing in the teams, in the marketing, in the supply chain to get into those markets, so it takes you a while to reach the scale to really be able to leverage those investments. And we're in the early days of the strategy, but we're very excited by the results that we're seeing both in Asia and Europe and feel like it's going to be a great part of the overall growth story for years to come. Laurent Potdevin : And Jim, all the work that we're doing with multi-store format in North America, whether it's a smaller store like the one in Vail, or whether it's a men's-only in SoHo or the expanded format in Miami, Santa Monica or Robson, I mean, are really sort of informing the type of model that we can roll out in parts of the world where we might have to play with different real estates. Jim Duffy : Got you. And then in some of your earlier international markets like, say, the U.K. or Singapore, when would you expect to move beyond that Phase 1 and into Phase 2, where you're exploring some of these other formats maybe outside of the capital cities? Laurent Potdevin : I think in Asia, we still have a fair amount of runway, probably a couple of years, before we start exploring the cities that are not a \"when\" but that are an \"if.\" In the U.K., we'll probably start exploring a couple of those locations next year, and then in the rest of Europe, we'll still be in the capital cities for the midterm. So we have tremendous runway ahead of us in leveraging the brand awareness that we've got in those capital cities, and to Stuart's point, really sort of planting our flag and claiming the market as we created. So a lot of runway in those cities that are a \"when\". Operator : Our final question comes from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Janet Kloppenburg : Just a couple of questions. Number one, it seems like your buying and occupancy pressure is increasing, Stuart, as you focus more on the international markets. Maybe you could help us with the leverage point on comp there as we model going forward. And secondly, Tara, I was wondering as you broaden your bottoms assortment, if there is an opportunity for AUR elevation? Tara Poseley : You want to start with that? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Sure, Janet. So yes, buying and occupancy, we're seeing elevated pressure from that into this -- into Q1, as we had in Q4. No surprise there. We expect that will be the story for the balance of the year. We expect that to moderate next year. We really -- if you look over the last few years, we haven't seen this level of occupancy pressure. We expect that to normalize into 2016. So on a year-over-year basis, that should be a benefit. But the -- at this point, I would say, it's attributable to just some of the discrete activities that we have ongoing this year from a real estate standpoint. And that's the combination of some of the higher rents for these big international flagships, some of the relocations and expansions that we've done in North America, and just the opening cadence that we have is higher than the company has ever had. And so for every store you open, you have a certain amount of preopening costs that are a drag from an occupancy standpoint, sort of the initial rent before the store is opened. So we've got more of that, that will moderate as well as we go forward. So I mean, those are the factors that are part of that story. I think over the long term, we'd expect to leverage our buying and occupancy in that high single-digit to low double-digit range just given the growth profile of the company. We're not quite there right now, but that's how we would envision the long-term model. Tara Poseley : And then, Janet, your question on the AUR elevation in bottoms... Janet Kloppenburg : Tara, you've noticed that Nike took their prices up on the bottoms, right? So I'm wondering what you guys are thinking. Tara Poseley : What we are really focused on is driving innovation in our bottoms category from fabrics and fit, and we will price accordingly as we continue to drive forward in those innovations. So again, we're always looking forward. We want to be the -- we are the leaders in driving innovation in the bottoms category, and we'll price accordingly. Operator : That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Tham for closing remarks. Chris Tham : Thank you, operator. That concludes our call for today. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Goodbye. Thanks Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Mr. Chris Tham. You may begin. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; Stuart Haselden, CFO; along with Tara Poseley, our Chief Product Officer, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we've assessed, but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our second quarter performance as well as give you an update on our progress surrounding our key strategic initiatives planned for the remainder of the year. Stuart will then walk you through our financials and guidance in more detail. As we enter the second half of the year, our team has made significant progress to grow our global collective by relentlessly innovating our products and continuing to create transformational experiences for our guests. We have many exciting milestones to cover today : the redesign of our women's pant wall launched last week, our fourth annual SeaWheeze marathon was another exceptional success here in Vancouver, and we supported new market seeding by hosting locally relevant events in our vibrant communities around the world, including in South Korea, Scotland and Germany. On the people front, we recently welcomed Miguel Almeida to lead our global digital transformation. Miguel is a global citizen with a great background, and as an avid endurance runner, is a superb fit for our culture. Miguel is a passionate champion of using the digital platform to deepen our connection with our guests through personalized experiences while also extending and amplifying brand resonance globally. I am thrilled to welcome Miguel to lululemon and truly start to leverage our digital opportunity. From a business standpoint, our momentum continues to build and our fundamentals are strong. As you will recall, we entered Q2 with a robust in-stock position, and we are confident that our guests would respond favorably to our product performance. This translated into a positive impact on our top line results with $453 million in net revenue for the quarter, up 16% over the second quarter of 2014 and up 21% in constant currency. We delivered an 11% global combined comp, with strong performances both in our store and e-commerce channels. The trends that we called out during our last quarter continue. In Q2, store comps across all our regions around the world were positive, and we delivered a global e-commerce comp of 35%. Our women's business continued to build momentum with a particularly strong performance in pants and bras, where both categories delivered double-digit comp for the quarter. Our men's business was up 31% on a combined comp basis, driven by our sweat category. And ivivva also posted double-digit comp growth with a 27% combined comp this quarter. As we build a global iconic brand, we are expanding our footprint globally. International expansion is a key growth driver, and we continued to increase our brand presence in major cities both in Europe and Asia. Later this month, I will be heading to Dubai for our first opening in the Middle East, which will be followed by a second store before year-end. Within Asia, we've seen all of our new stores exceed initial plans. Our first store in Hong Kong, which opened this past quarter at ifc mall, is in contention to be the most productive store in the company on a per-square foot basis. We are opening our second store in Hong Kong later this quarter, with a larger format in an exceptional location at Hysan Place. This early performance, combined with our Singapore performance and the success of our store in Seoul, validates the demand for our products and brand in Asia and leaves us confident with our development plan and its trajectory. Looking to Europe. Our first store in Hamburg, Germany opened late last week and another store in the London area will open tomorrow. Our Covent Garden store, which was our first store to open in the London region, and our newer King's Road store both continued to perform well. In addition, we see these stores driving incremental traffic and sales to our U.K. e-commerce site. Outside of the U.K, we continued to drive brand awareness in key European markets. We have opened showrooms in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and France. All showrooms are performing on target and will trigger store rollout in the next 12 to 18 months. Turning to products. We met another key milestone with the successful launch of our women's pant wall last week. This is such a powerful illustration of our people working together to innovate, educate and reinvent the category that we created back in 1998. We had evolved the technical design of our women's pants to focus on engineered sensation. Our innovation combines design, sports psychology and training compression science to create a carefully considered spectrum of sensations, allowing our guests to choose the right pants for her workout and unlock her performance potential. The engineered sensation spectrum within the new pant wall includes 5 categories ranging from relaxed to tight. Both new and classic styles are incorporated into these 5 categories, consisting of relaxed, naked, held-in, hugged and tight. We launched 4 brand-new styles with innovations including new constructions and engineering, seamless technologies and new fabrics such as our lulu fabric, which is engineered to be lightweight and have a soft second skin feel. While it's too early to analyze and quantify guests' feedback, I am absolutely thrilled to see our educators and ambassadors respond to the product. They are and have always been the best indicator of a future product success. Women's bottoms are the core of our success, and with the category performing strongly, we are looking ahead and have turned our attention to tanks with new offerings that hit the stores late in Q2 and more being expected in Q3. Our innovation is focused on varying levels of support, coverage and fit options. The solid 31% comp in our men's business was driven by strong sales in the sweat category, which is the anchor of our men's business. Along with further improvements to our Metal Vent franchise, we continue to introduce new fabrics such as Intrinsic [ph] and Pima tech [ph] to support our male guests' training pursuits. That said, all men's categories, including our no-sweat and post-sweat offerings, performed well. And this result continues to validate our goal of building a $1 billion men's business globally. With ivivva, our strong comp was supported by ongoing brand-building activities. Our stores and showrooms held complementary community events to connect girls to movement, such as soccer clinics held with the Ottawa Fury and increased engagement online through our #campivivva campaign. Turning now to our investments within guest experience. Our RFID rollout continued in the second quarter and is expected to be completed by the end of Q3. The successful implementation of this project will not only enable seamless inventory management and labor savings in the store, but most importantly, will also unlock the potential for unique guest experience across channels. Another key strategic investment is the redesign of our website to aesthetically showcase our brand. With Miguel coming onboard and as we prioritize our digital initiative for the remainder of the year, we have decided to launch our new website in Q1 of 2016. This shift in timing allows us to free up some bandwidth to focus on optimizing traffic and conversion on our current platform at a critical time of the year. It also creates more runway to fully leverage the new site design when we launch early next year. Last, but not least, we would not unlock the full potential of our product and guest initiative if it wasn't for the amazing work that our brand and community team is doing growing our collective around the world. Over the summer, we completed our Get Quiet Live Loud 16-city tour and connected with thousands of our educators and ambassadors around the globe. In Hong Kong, the tour stop occurred just after the weekend opening of our ifc store, which was a great way to inspire and honestly be inspired by the amazing educators and ambassadors in Hong Kong. Each city experience was unique, and it was an opportunity to share our long-term vision with an engaged and passionate audience at every stop along the tour. I personally attended 7 of those stops from Vancouver to Chicago and Shanghai. I connected with over 2,500 of our educators and ambassadors and came back energized and impressed by the collective I get to work with. Last month, over 10,000 runners from around the world joined us in Vancouver for our annual Half Marathon SeaWheeze, an experience like no other. SeaWheeze showcases the heart, mind and body of lululemon and provides us with an opportunity to drive hometown brand love and build global brand awareness. In 4 years, the race has started to become a popular destination experience with 70% of runners hailing from outside of British Columbia, including the United States, Australia, Europe, South America and Asia. SeaWheeze weekend offered something for everyone, including the ultimate after-party, our Sunset Festival in Stanley Park. This year's race sold out in 35 minutes. So those of you with a half marathon on your bucket list should know that online registration for SeaWheeze 2016 is next Wednesday. Some other highlights. We have partnered with O2X, a company started by former Navy SEALs with the goal of maximizing human performance. As the exclusive apparel partner of the O2X Summit series, we have created unique outdoor experiences that present more than just a physical challenge. The people at O2X are just as passionate about mindfulness as we are, making this a great fit for our partnership. The O2X Summit series races take place in 3 months in locations in British Columbia, Colorado and New Hampshire. Over the next couple of months, we will launch our own [ph] Canada campaign through both our stores and online channels to celebrate our Canadian roots during the month of October and Canadian Thanksgiving. And we just launched Unroll Europe [ph], a lululemon-sponsored yoga tour across key cities in Europe and the U.K. including London, Paris, Zurich, Munich and Stockholm. We continue to build brand awareness in these cities to support our store and showroom activities already underway. Finally, this year's investments in our product engine and supply chain are creating the solid foundation to support our long-term growth plans. The complexity of building a global, scalable infrastructure while expanding product offering and geographic footprint has created near-term pressure to gross margin. We have enhanced our current teams with additional resources and are laser-focused on this short-term issue. We are confident in our long-term outlook and ability to deliver on the improvements we've committed to in 2016 and beyond. Stuart will provide more color within his comments on our strategic investments and goal for gross margin expansion, in addition to more details about our outlook around inventory levels. In conclusion. Our team has accomplished some great work in the first half of the year, and with a culture grounded in innovation, we are relentlessly striving to create a better experience for our guests. We are amplifying our voice and we are building our collective around the world. We have a robust pipeline of new products and the right team in place to execute on our strategic goals with key initiatives that cut across product, brand and guest experience. To all of our educators, store managers and ambassadors, and our entire collective : I'm so grateful for your energy and I'm proud to work alongside you as we grow this bold, audacious, innovative global brand. I'll now turn things over to Stuart to review our financial results and provide guidance for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our second quarter in 2015, and then I'll update you on our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year 2015. For Q2, total net revenue rose 16% to $453 million from $390.7 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in revenue was driven by total constant-dollar comparable sales growth of 11%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 6% and a 35% growth online; also, square footage growth of 24% versus last year, driven by the addition of 66 net new company-operated stores since Q2 of 2014 : 39 net new stores in the United States, 3 stores in Canada, 1 store in Australia, 3 in Europe, 3 in Asia and 17 ivivva stores; and offset by the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $20.3 million or 4.5%. During the second quarter, we opened 20 net new company- operated stores : 9 in the U.S., 1 in Canada, 2 in Europe, 2 in Asia and 6 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 336 total stores versus 270 a year ago. There are now 250 stores in our comp base : 40 of those in Canada, 163 in the United States, 28 in Australia and New Zealand, 1 in Europe and 18 ivivva. At the end of Q2, we also have a total of 82 showrooms in operation : 28 lululemon showrooms in North America, 17 internationally and 37 ivivva. Company-operated stores represented 75% of total revenue or $339.8 million versus 75.3% or $294 million in the second quarter of last year. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer channel totaled $82.2 million or 18.2% of total revenue versus $63.5 million or 16.2% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-ups and outlets, totaled $31 million or 6.8% of revenue for the second quarter versus $33.2 million or 8.5% of revenue in the second quarter of last year. Gross profit for the second quarter was $212 million or 46.8% of net revenue compared to $197.3 million or 50.5% of net revenue in Q2 2014. The factors which contributed to this 370 basis point decline in gross margin were : a 110 basis points of product margin decline, of which half was attributable to the cost variances primarily related to the port slowdown, and the balance resulting from selling mix and raw material liabilities actions taken in the quarter; 30 basis points attributable to higher markdowns, primarily due to the online warehouse sale we held this quarter; 50 basis points deleverage due to higher airfreight costs; 70 basis points deleverage due to the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar; and 110 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation, which was related to our international expansion, renewals of existing stores and higher lease costs associated with an increase in major renovations and relocations. SG&A expenses were $145.4 million or 32.1% of net revenue compared with $129.4 million or 33.1% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 12% SG&A dollar increase is due to the following : an increase in operating expenses associated with new and existing stores, showrooms and outlets, including costs related to our international expansion; increased variable operating costs associated with the growth in our e-commerce business; and increased head office costs associated with strategic investments and growth in the business. These were partially offset with net foreign exchange gains driven from the revaluation of monetary assets in our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which, on translation, also decreased reported SG&A by $10.2 million or 2%.  As a result, operating income for the quarter was $66.6 million or 14.7% of net revenue compared with $67.9 million or 17.4% of net revenue in Q2 2014. Tax expense for the quarter was $19.8 million or a tax rate of 29.3% compared to $21 million or a tax rate of 30.1% in the second quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $47.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to net income of $48.7 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2014. There was effectively a nominal impact to earnings from foreign currency this quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 141.644 million versus 145.544 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 987,616 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $63.96 per share. Capital expenditures were $37.2 million for the quarter compared to $26.7 million in the second quarter last year. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $541.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was $280.6 million or 55% higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, compounding the year-over-year comparison for Q2 is the fact that we were significantly under-inventoried for Q2 last year, with effectively no sequential build in our stock position from Q1 to Q2. So there are timing differences this year. Also, during our last call, we indicated inventory levels would remain elevated as we manage through the impact of the port delays and implement our exit strategies. The good news here is that our supply chain has normalized and we are now flowing inventory on schedule. However, our reported inventories will continue to look elevated as late product from the first half of the year now combines with on-time flows, and in some cases, early flows for the second half. In Q2, we saw some early receipts of Q3 product as well as higher in-transit. It is important to note that our outlook on inventory levels remains the same, and we are on track with the strategy outlined during our last call. As a reminder, we identified opportunities to reflow approximately 2/3 of the late-arriving inventory into our second half assortments at full price with little incremental markdown risk. The remaining 1/3 will be sold down through our normal exit channels, which includes our outlet stores, online warehouse sales and physical warehouse sales. As you know, we conducted the first of these exit actions through our Q2 online warehouse sale that delivered good results and keeps us on track. We expect inventory to be better aligned with our forward sales trends by the end of the year. This now leads me to our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2015. We expect the momentum seen in our Q2 results to carry into the third quarter and now expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $477 million to $482 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the high single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the third quarter of 2014 and assumes the Canadian dollar at $0.76 to the U.S. dollar compared to our prior assumption of $0.80 and 17 new store openings : 11 lululemon stores and 6 ivivva. In fact, through the first 5 weeks of Q3, we have seen positive store comps across all regions, reflecting the continued momentum of our business. We anticipate our gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 47%. We will see product margin pressures in Q3 with certain of the trends that influenced Q2 extending into the current quarter. Airfreight will remain a headwind, but will improve sequentially. Occupancy and depreciation deleverage as well as foreign exchange will continue to weigh on gross margin in Q3. We expect SG&A in the third quarter to delever slightly from Q3 2014 due to strategic investments as well as the anniversary-ing of incentive compensation reversals last year. You may recall that SG&A in Q3 of last year included a nonrecurring benefit of $3.5 million related to incentive compensation accrual reversals. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and a 141.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.37 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2,025,000,000 to $2,055,000,000. We remain on plan to open 60 company-operated stores, which includes up to 8 new stores in Asia and Europe and also 20 ivivva stores. We expect gross margin for the year to delever from 2014, impacted by the factors we mentioned earlier. Quarterly gross margin will be sequentially better in Q4 and benefit from improved airfreight levels, coupled with stabilized merchandise margins and less deleverage of fixed costs due to the high sales volumes generated during Q4. We expect slight deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2014, driven by continued strategic investments in guest experience, our website, brand and IT systems. We now expect a net impact to earnings from foreign exchange for the year to increase from approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share when compared to fiscal year 2014. As a result, we expect operating margin to delever from 2014 and our fiscal year 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $1.92. This is based off of a 141.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q2 of 2015 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 30.2%. We expect capital expenditures to range between $135 million to $140 million for the fiscal year 2015, reflecting new store openings including outlets, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments. In closing, we are excited to see momentum building in our business. We are pleased with the progress we are making across all of our strategic initiatives, including our supply chain improvements, which are the underpinnings of how we will deliver recovery in our product margins into next year. Specifically, the investments we have made in our go-to-market process, combined with identified logistics and distribution efficiencies, position us to deliver on our margin expansion goals into next year. And while our inventory levels now are higher than we'd like, the product is very current and we are on track to work down excess levels and rebalance in the second half of the year. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : I guess, two questions. I guess, Stuart first. Just looking at your current gross margin guidance now for 2015, has your view changed on the opportunity? I think we've talked about 300 basis points, I think, of merchandise margin recovery for next year. Or what buckets maybe that's going to come from? So just curious there on has your view changed for next year's opportunity. And then on the comments that all regions are comping positive, so just think about your most mature stores in Canada, what would you point to as being the biggest changes you have made there in restimulating that oldest class of stores? Laurent Potdevin : Brian, this is Laurent. Before I let Stuart dig into the gross margin question, I think that what you're seeing in Canada is really the result of the work that we've done across product innovation, guest experience and brand and community and the quality of the assortments. So we are very, very pleased about, after 12 quarters of declining comps in Canada, we're actually seeing positive comps and we are seeing the same results in Australia. So I think it's really -- we've been speaking for quite some time now about the triangle of guest experience, brand and community and product coming together, and when you think about the recent launch of our new pant wall, I mean, that was a prime example of the power of our teams collaborating and coming together and really delivering what we are known for. So -- and it's certainly paying off in our most mature market, being Canada. And before we get into the details of gross margin, I mean, I think it's -- and I'm sure we'll have a lot of questions on gross margin. I mean, it's really, really important for everybody to understand that the short-term gross margin pressure that we are experiencing is not the result of higher markdowns or quality issues. We're building a very scalable, complex platform at a time when we're growing internationally. And we've added resources to the team, and we've validated that not only we will see the margin expansion that we've committed to, but we'll see it in 2016 and beyond, as we have stated before. Stuart Haselden : And Brian, we remain confident in the product margin opportunities that we have identified for 2016. We continue to build out the details of our implementation plans this year. As a reminder, that opportunity we identified was a 300 basis point improvement in product margins in 2016 versus 2014. The full year amounts for those annual comparisons, that's on a pre-FX basis. And it's the same things that we've been talking about. We'll capture this through primarily the improvements in our go-to-market calendar process, improvements that will deliver lower airfreight, improved raw material management and better costing. And additionally, as you look at gross margin, the other buckets that -- and there are other things weighing heavily on gross margins this year. We'll begin to leverage our infrastructure investments that we've been making this year, but we should also see markdowns normalize. And occupancy and depreciation costs should moderate into next year. We expect it'll still be a headwind, but not to the same degree as it has been this year. It'll be more in line with what our historical experience has been. As you then think about that -- those goals and connecting that to the results we just announced for Q2, the guidance for Q3 and Q4, I think the issues that are weighing on product margins this quarter and in Q -- and that we see extending into Q3 are not structural, that we'll be able to clear the port-related items that we've seen weighing on our margins and the other factors that I just mentioned as we get into next year. In Q4 specifically, we'll clear those port-related issues. That will not be -- that will not weigh on our margins. We'll see some modest product margin recovery in Q4. That will combine with better leverage on our fixed costs in the fourth quarter just from the higher sales levels in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, that's addressing your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Alexander with BB&T Capital Markets. Paul Alexander : Just a little clarification on current trends in the comp guidance. There has been some comments that sales trends continue to build and accelerate sequentially, but the comp guidance for third quarter of high single digits, while only a small moderation, does imply a moderation from 2Q. So is there something we should be thinking about? Or did you maybe see a deceleration in August related to the Labor Day -- later Labor Day or something else that we should be thinking about? Stuart Haselden : So on the comps, we continue to see strong trends in traffic and conversion, sequential improvements in both of those, and that's across all our regions. So I would not want you to take away anything from the guidance that our comp momentum is slowing down in any way. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Jim Duffy : Can you talk to the -- can you please speak to the tactical strategies to bring inventory more in line with expectations? And then related to that, from our checks, the response to the new pants offering has been exceptional, but we have seen some instances of out-of-stocks. Is the product flow for the new pants offering in line with your expectations? Stuart Haselden : Yes, so I'll tackle the inventory clearance question first. So we're on track to what we had talked about last quarter. So we had described, and I think we've reiterated in our prepared remarks, that we had about 1/3 of the excess identified to be pushed through our normal exit channels and about 2/3 will be the reflow into our assortments in the second half. We had a successful online warehouse sale in the second quarter that enabled us to clear a little less than half of the excess overhang that we had from Q1. We have 2 physical warehouse sales planned for the balance of the year : one in Q3, one in Q4. And we're -- we also are opening 8 additional factory outlet stores this year. So the combination of those factors gives us the bandwidth or the capability to easily work through that excess, on plan with what we had previously outlined. Tara Poseley : And then this is Tara and I can answer about out-of-stock. We've had really good initial reads on the pant wall, but we absolutely have inventory that we are in the process of allocating to stores. So those out-of-stocks that you may have perhaps seen, we did a big push of inventory prior to Labor Day weekend and you should see those level out as we get into the coming weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Laurent, first question, bigger picture. I have seen the new pant wall, looks great. As we think about you reintroducing product, launching new innovation, new product going forward, how are you thinking about pricing? Can you just talk higher level your thoughts on updating pricing strategies overall? Laurent Potdevin : Well, I mean, I think I'll go back to our products used always to be at the top end of the pyramid of the market that we've created. And as we look at new categories or at innovation of our current categories, I mean, we are very much pushing our teams both from a design standpoint and from a functional standpoint with white space and in collaboration with our ambassadors to really create products that are going to drive function and design at the top end. So I mean, we're not seeing ourselves being limited by pricing at all, as long as we deliver the value for our guests both from a function and from a design standpoint. Matthew McClintock : And Stuart, if I -- just a housekeeping question. The relaunch of the website, now that that's, I believe, in the first quarter of next year, is that having any impact at all on your comp guidance for the full year? Stuart Haselden : Matt, not really. I think it was more a decision to allow a little more runway to get the website exactly where we wanted it. We also had the benefit now of having Miguel on the team, and his leadership is critical in that area. And it helps the team remain focused on optimizing business in the critical fourth quarter as well, versus trying to manage also a major website implementation. So just felt like the right decision given those circumstances, and it really isn't -- it's not weighing on the comp guidance in any way. Operator : Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : You've had acceleration in the men's business, wondering any more detail there. On the pant wall, I believe you're introducing the tank wall in the second -- in the fourth quarter. Pricing on the tank wall versus pricing of tanks now and how do you expect that to be different than the introduction of the pant wall? And just lastly, you mentioned a bit about occupancy. How is renegotiating of existing leases changing your overall occupancy costs? Tara Poseley : Dana, it's Tara. So we're really pleased with the men's business, as you heard from Laurent's prepared remarks, a 31% comp in the men's business, and we're really seeing acceleration across all categories within men's. But a real highlight that we're excited about is the sweat category and continue to see strength in that area, which is really the foundation of our men's athletic business. And we've been introducing new fabrics this year that are reinforcing our sweat platform. We had a new fabric, Intrinsic [ph], in Q1. We have Pima tech [ph] coming in Q3, very pleased with that. As for the tank wall, just to remind everybody, we had focused on the tank wall for Q2. Due to the port strike slowdown, we didn't get our tanks styled in until the very end of Q2. We saw nice response and comp trend change when we finally got our full range of support and tanks out in the stores. You'll continue to see new styles throughout Q3 and Q4 being added to the tank wall. And we're taking all of the great learnings that we're getting right now and incorporating that into our assortment for next year in 2016. And as for pricing, as Laurent said, where it warrants, where we're adding innovation, where we feel that we have that balance of really driving something new and different to our guests, we'll be pricing it appropriately within our tank pricing structure. Stuart Haselden : And Dana, on your question on occupancy. I think the remodels -- or the renewals are an element of the pressure we've seen. We have great landlords, great relationships and are driving, I think, good terms there. As you look at the pressure, particularly in Q2, the new store opening cadence is really a bigger factor. We opened 20 stores in the second quarter compared to 7 last year. So just the year-over-year increase in new store openings is a bigger factor. Also the international stores we're opening, we've mentioned this before, come at a little higher occupancy costs and oftentimes include key money, which gets factored into that occupancy amortization. So those are probably bigger factors for us. We've also -- we're excited about the major renovations and relocations that we've also been pursuing and that also weighs into it, but it's smaller than just the new store opening cadence. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Robert Drbul : I'd just like to ask about the international expansion a little bit. I think you're pretty happy with some of the stores that you're seeing, Asia exceeding initial plans. Can you talk a little bit about the profitability ramp that you see? And do you believe we'll be able to get to current or peak prior operating margins? And how the store opening expenses are trending from that perspective? Stuart Haselden : Bob, on international, some very exciting new store openings. I think Laurent mentioned the ifc Centre in Hong Kong. That store is contending for the highest sales per square foot in our company. And on a four-wall basis, very attractive operating four-wall profit. And so in general, we're happy with the new stores we're opening internationally. Pleased with the results in Europe. Asia has been really off the charts, that's on a four-wall basis. We are making significant investments in terms of the management teams to drive these regional businesses, marketing to support the store openings and building the supply chain to support these businesses. So it'll take us a while to get a critical mass to be able to leverage those investments. I think what we've said earlier in the year in regards to just the operating profit profile, we believe international will weigh on the company's operating margins, at least in the near to medium term. We're expecting to, over the next few years, to return to that low to mid-20s EBIT margin range, with the North American business being more in the mid-range of that -- of the 20%, 20% to 25% range, and international averaging it down, if that makes sense. So it'll continue to weigh on it. We're excited in terms of just the four-wall profit. We're excited about that as a long-term growth strategy for the company, and we're confident that we'll be able to drive operating profit improvements into the near term. Laurent Potdevin : And Bob, maybe to add to that a little bit. I mean, we're very -- when it comes to our international strategy, I mean, we're very, very focused on capital cities, where we know we've got a lot of demand and we're generating a lot of traffic and transactions. And as we deal with the same topics that we're on [ph] with digital and Miguel, we're coming up with some very exciting and nimble ways to really build brand resonance and brand awareness beyond those major cities, without necessarily spreading stores very rapidly throughout many countries. So I think we've been very strategic in focusing on the major cities and leveraging digital to grow brand resonance and awareness beyond those cities. Operator : Our next question comes from Dorothy Lakner with Topeka Capital. Dorothy Lakner : Just a question on the store renovations and relocations. Just wondered how many -- just remind us how many you're doing this year, how many you might do next year and how those -- the new formats are performing. Santa Monica looks great, by the way. Stuart Haselden : Yes. So we're going to do 10 of those major renovations, remodels this year. That's on top of the 3 from last year that we had mentioned. Some of the 10 that we'll do this year include the expansion of our Park Royal store here in Vancouver, the opening -- the relocation of our Union Square store in New York to a location on Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron area, expansion of our Chinook Center, and expansion of our West Edmonton stores. So those are all major remodels, expansions, where the square footage is growing by at least 50% or in that range or higher, in some cases. And the majority of those are still teed up for the second half of the year, so I can't really give a good indication on how those particular projects are performing. But I will say the ones that we've mentioned from last year, Robson, Santa Monica, Lincoln Road, all continue to exceed expectations. In fact, Robson Street is on track to become the highest grossing sales-producing store in the chain at over $20 million this year. And I might remind you that before we relocated that store, it was an $11 million store. So a pretty strong outcome in that relocation that gives us a lot of enthusiasm to continue to look for opportunities similar to that throughout the chain. We think this will be an important part of the square footage growth story of the company in a very profitable manner in the years to come, but we're excited for that. We'll be able to speak with more details around how the openings this year and the projects this year are performing on our next call. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Filandro with Susquehanna. Thomas Filandro : Two questions. One is on the direct-to-consumer front, nice growth again. You got expansion in the margins there. I'd be curious if you can give us some insight on what drove the acceleration in expansion. And with the OPM and DTC now at 40% plus, is that a sustainable rate? And then a question, I think, for Tara. I believe there's been some pricing adjustments on pants, some up and some down, if that's correct. Can you just give us an understanding of what's happening, frame for us the adjustments and how should we think about averaging of retail in the second half of the year? Stuart Haselden : Thomas, I'll tackle your direct question first. So we continue to see strength in traffic and conversion in our e-commerce business. It's really the continuation of the story that we saw from Q1. And we think a big piece of this is simply the improved inventory position that we're now in. We're able to better meet demands, and I think in the second quarter, we had some interesting product flows that supported just the conversion. As we talked about, we have a major website remodel or relaunch, I should say, teed up for next year. So we feel good about where our website is today. We think we can be better. So we're very excited to see the continued momentum in the direct business and we, by no means, think we've topped out there. We believe there's still opportunity to be had as we continue to enhance and improve not only the website capabilities, but just how we engage with our customers via digital marketing and otherwise. Tara Poseley : And then this is Tara and I'll take on the pricing. With -- we had an opportunity recently to just really clean up our pricing architecture within the pant classification. So you are right, there are some prices that came down and some prices that came up as we really just cleaned up the architecture to make it easier for our educators to educate against our different styles. And then obviously, you could see the innovation that we launched in the pant wall and we're very excited about that and very excited our guest response and continues to reinforce as we deliver innovation to our guest. She's excited about it and sees the value in it. As for the average unit retail for the remainder of the year, probably slight increase, but really that was not the reason for this. It was really just cleaning up our pricing architecture and really continuing to make way for us to bring in more innovation into all of our assortments. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Stuart, in terms of the supply chain and the next chapters here, could you just brief us on catalysts as you think about the sourcing partners, the go-to-market timing and when that may be, which classifications or timing may that be implemented? And then as you think about omni-channel in your supply chain, I was just curious. And Tara and Laurent, I was just curious about the pant wall and the men's. As a percentage of mix, do you expect those classifications to change over time? And then Tara, on core versus basics, were there any thoughts about how you're feeling about that mix at the moment and going forward? Stuart Haselden : Oliver, so yes, on the supply chain catalysts, it's the things we've been talking about in terms of how the go-to-market calendar will synchronize. Our design and sourcing activities enable us to be a better partner to our vendors, more predictable demand management and a better synchronized process, where we can ring [ph] efficiencies and reduce waste in fabric and expedited shipping costs. So those all remain the focus. Our planning continues to ramp this year and the team's -- and the capabilities to support that are the investments that we're making this year. The timing remains the 300 basis points, as I had described it earlier, over the course of 2016 in comparison to 2014. Tara Poseley : Oliver, so the pant wall as a percent to the mix, I don't see that changing dramatically over time. Pant wall is our first place that we really tackled and launch with new innovation, but you'll continue to see that in other categories within both men's and women's. So I'm expecting our mix to relatively stay the same between tops and bottoms and jackets, et cetera. And then the balance of, I think, you said core versus basic. Really, the balance, how we think about it is seasonal and core. I think we've struck a very nice balance that we have in the stores right now. We know with seasonal how important newness is to our guests, how important delivering new products every week and the excitement that, that drives both online and guests coming into the store. So we feel really confident that we've got a nice balance as we go forward. Laurent Potdevin : And Oliver, to Tara's point, I mean, I think that we started with -- we focused initially on the pant category and that's really the anchor of our women's business. That's what drives traffic and what ultimately drives sort of multiple purchases in the stores. So I mean, that's why we really don't see the mix changing, but actually driving higher sales in all of our categories. Operator : Our last question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about SG&A, beyond this year, what's the best way to think about the total expense dollar growth in relation to sales growth? Just any color around remaining investments. And do we need to consider the timing of the website shift into next year as maybe an additional build? Stuart Haselden : Matt, so yes, I think as we look at the near to medium term, we expect to be able to see modest SG&A leverage into next year. I'm going to balance that with just the ongoing strategic investments that we're going to continue to make in the business. It will have priority to enable us to continue to drive our growth initiatives. So that -- we'll balance those two objectives for sure. But ensuring we have the resources and the capabilities to deliver on our growth goals is the primary factor to consider there. In looking at Q2 and Q3, the leverage that we saw in Q2 was affected by the FX translation. For the P&L overall, FX was neutral, as we mentioned, but there was a benefit in the second quarter there. In Q3, the slight deleverage that we're calling out is related to, again, those strategic investments. And specifically, in the third quarter, we are anniversary-ing that comp -- that incentive comp reversal from last year. So that creates some comparative pressure this year. But again, I think we'll remain focused on making the investments we need and -- as well as working to deliver modest SG&A improvements. Operator : Thank you. This includes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris for closing remarks. Chris Tham : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We'll talk to you again in the quarter. Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, Senior Vice President of Finance. Sir, you may begin. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; Stuart Haselden, CFO; along with Miguel Almeida, EVP of Digital, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.  Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting company management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we had assessed, but which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be available under the Investor section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for one hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide an overview of our third quarter performance as well as highlight our progress against various initiatives, which incorporates the recent changes to our organizational structure. Stuart will then walk you through our financial and guidance in more detail. First, from a top line perspective, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. We delivered $480 million in net revenue for the quarter, up 14% over the third quarter of 2014 and up 20% in constant currency. We achieved a 9% global combined comp, the result of strong performance across our channels and regions. Once again in Q3, store comps across all regions were positive and we delivered a global e-commerce comp of 21%. This solid top line performance is a testament to the continued strength of our brand and loyalty of our guests. Our gross margin and inventory position came in within our expectations for the quarter, and we reported EPS of $0.38 per share.  In line with macroeconomic trends, the start of Q4 has been mixed. We saw lower traffic in the final weeks of Q3 and into the first couple of weeks of Q4, with steady improvement since Thanksgiving. Given the current environment, we are taking a conservative stance with revenue in Q4, while taking the necessary actions to manage inventory and control expenses. Our work to build a scalable global supply chain is beginning to pay off and we saw an inflection of our product margins beginning in Q4. I would like to start by emphasizing that this year's investments in our product engine and supply chain remain very much on track. We are now seeing sequential improvement in product margin and remain focused and confident in our goals.  We continue to strategically invest in people, processes and technology that will deliver strong, long-term profitability and support our global expansion and 10-year vision. Stuart will provide more details within his comments on our strategic investments and progress on margin expansion, along with an outlook on our inventory levels.  Our women's business has continued to be strong with an acceleration in pants and bras, where both categories delivered double-digit comps for the quarter. On our last call, we had just launched our new women's pant wall. This was among the company's most significant global launches combining education, innovation and a re-imagination of this category. We have seen a fantastic response from our guest with women's pants generating a 27% comp in Q3 and bras were not also far behind with a strong comp of 18%. With new creative leadership and direction, the design team is laser focused on delivering new styles and innovation for the top and tank categories that will give our guests varying levels of support, coverage and fit options.  Our men's business continues to outpace our overall growth, comping 24% for the quarter. This performance was and continues to be attributed in large part to our sweat category, the anchor of the men's business. The technical function of our sweat assortment, combined with our deep community relationship with our ambassador, is what gives us long-term relevance and continues to set us apart.  Our ivivva brand also posted double-digit comp growth with a 23% combined comp for the quarter. This strong performance continues to demonstrate how authentically this brand resonates with our young guests. And for those of you who are listening from New York, we just opened our first ivivva pop-up location in Union Square, and I encourage you to drop in and discover it for yourself. Turning now to creating amazing experiences for our guests. We have fully deployed RFID to all North American stores. This technology is a powerful new tool in creating seamless guest experiences across all channels and has greatly enhanced our ability to access inventory quickly across all channels and locations. Our in-store ability to access our incoming inventories through our bag backroom app accounted for 8% of e-commerce revenue for the quarter.  We continue to engage new communities as we open new location across the world. In November, we opened our Flatiron flagship in New York City. This amazing location holds our largest store to date and offers dedicated concierge services delighting guests with everything from booking the most products or classes to discovering the best runs in the city. This location serves local New York guests and is a platform for the rest of the world to discover lululemon. Located on the lower level of the store, HUB seventeen is a 3,000-square foot space dedicated to connecting our guests with ambassador amongst many other things. It's an incredible space for our collective to engage with friends, sweat, enjoy the work of local artists and live music. Throughout Q3, we made further progress expanding our global collective. We opened our first store in Dubai at the Mall of Emirates and have a second store planned by the end of the year. In Europe, we opened 2 new stores including Marylebone in London as well as 2 new showrooms. In Asia, we opened our second location in Hong Kong at Hysan Place, and I'm extremely pleased with its performance since opening. In the second week of Q4, we launched our shop-in-shop on Tmall, attracting 165,000 unique visitors on the first day, clearly validating the strength of the platform as key to building our brand awareness in China. Tmall provides an opportunity to introduce new guests to our brand and support our existing showroom locations as we continue to build our community in China. In addition, the performance of our showroom in South Korea continues to far exceed our expectations, and we are excited to open 2 new stores in Seoul in the first half of next year.  On the brand and community side, we launched a number of engaging initiatives. Om Canada was a celebration of our roots and included community events across the country. I recently visited Toronto and was amazed at the thoughtful execution of this program among our 6 stores and our continued commitment to our home market. We are seeing this focus clearly pay off as Canada posted another positive store comp in Q3. Finally, I'm thrilled to share the progress we've made to our organizational structure. Over the past 18 months, we've built a global world-class management team that is diverse and culturally aligned to drive our strategic global priorities and successfully position us to lead into our 10-year vision.  In October, we appointed Lee Holman as our Creative Director, uniting both men's and women's vision under one overarching design. Lee brings a perfect balance of function, design and craftsmanship, making his ability to solve problems for athletes second to none. Dr. Tom Waller was promoted Senior Vice President, Whitespace, our R&D facility. Tom will continue to lead our team of scientists and engineers and be the catalyst for innovation across the entire organization. By elevating our passion for design and innovation, we will continue to strengthen our position as the global market leader in the category we created. Stuart Haselden has added Executive Vice President, Operations to his title, assuming broader responsibilities focused on driving operational excellence. And we are well along in the process of selecting a Chief Supply Chain Officer who will take on the work we started to optimize our global supply chain. Last, but certainly not least, this November, we announced the appointment of Gina Warren as Executive Vice President, Culture & Talent, reporting directly to me. Patience is paying off, and after a lengthy search, I am beyond thrilled to have Gina join us with her exceptional track record of driving global culture rooted in leadership and development. Our people are the core that will drive this brand into the future. A true visionary, I look to Gina to nurture, lead and evolve our unique culture as we grow our global collective. As we near the end of the calendar year, our work is starting to pay off. We are relentless and focused in driving our priorities, thanks to a passionate group of leaders and an entire collective of smart, engaged, driven individuals throughout the organization, including our educators, store managers, ambassadors and support teams around the globe. I am more confident than ever that we will continue to build on our current momentum and deliver long-term profitable growth.  Finally, before turning it over to Stuart, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Tom Stemberg. Tom was not only the retail legend we all know and a critical member of the lululemon Board since December of 2005, he was also a dear friend of the company and truly loved lululemon. As the Chairman of the lululemon Compensation Committee, Tom's passion for building unique programs focused on health and wellness knew absolutely no bounds. I will be forever grateful for his commitment to making me a better leader and lululemon a better company. We will all miss him dearly.  I'll now turn things over to Stuart to review our financial results and provide guidance for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year. Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our third quarter of 2015, and then I'll update you on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 2015.  For Q3, total net revenue rose 14% to $479.7 million from $419.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in revenue was driven by total constant dollar comparable sales growth of 9% comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 6% and online growth of 21%. Also, square footage growth of 22% versus last year, driven by the addition of 65 new company-operated stores since Q3 of 2014, 33 new stores in the United States, 2 stores in Canada, 1 store in Australia, 5 in Europe, 4 in Asia and 20 ivivva stores. And offset by the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $24.7 million or 5.2%. During the third quarter, we opened 18 new company-operated stores, 9 in the U.S, 2 in Europe, 1 in Asia and 6 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 354 total stores versus 289 a year ago. There are now 266 stores in our comp base, 42 of those in Canada, 173 in the United States, 30 in Australia and New Zealand, 1 in Europe and 20 ivivva. At the end of Q3, we also had a total of 86 showrooms in operation, 27 lululemon showrooms in North America, 19 internationally and 40 ivivva showrooms.  Company-operated stores represented 73.7% of total revenue or $353.4 million versus 73.9% or $310 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $89.3 million or 18.6% of total revenue versus $77.2 million or 18.4% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-up stores, warehouse sales and outlets totaled $37 million or 7.7% of revenue for the third quarter versus $32.2 million or 7.7% of revenue in the third quarter of last year.  Gross profit for the third quarter was $224.8 million or 46.9% of net revenue compared to $211.1 million or 50.3% of net revenue in Q3 of 2014. The factors which contributed to this 340 basis point decline in gross margin were 130 basis points of overall product margin decline as the port-related product costs and selling mix pressures observed in Q2 continued to be meaningful in Q3, but were offset by improved air freight usage; 70 basis points attributable to higher markdowns; 90 basis points of decline due to the foreign exchange impact of a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar; and 120 basis points deleverage from occupancy and depreciation, which is related to new stores, including international locations and higher lease costs associated with major renovations, relocations and regular renewals. These items were offset by 70 basis points of leverage in supply chain overhead costs. SG&A expenses were $156.6 million or 32.7% of net revenue compared to $129.9 million or 30.9% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 21% SG&A dollar increase is due to the following : an increase in operating expenses associated with new and existing stores, showrooms and outlets, including costs related to the expansion of our international business; increased variable operating costs associated with the growth in our e-commerce channel; increased head office costs associated with strategic investments and one-time severance of roughly $1 million; increase in net foreign exchange revaluation losses of $3.4 million. These items were offset with a weaker Canadian and Australian dollar, which on translation decreased reported SG&A by $13.5 million or 8.6%. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $68.2 million or 14.2% of net revenue compared with $81.2 million or 19.4% of net revenue in Q3 of 2014.  Tax expense for the quarter was $12.1 million or a tax rate of 18.6% compared to $22.5 million or a tax rate of 27.1% a year ago. Included in our tax expense for this quarter is an income tax recovery of $7.7 million related to the company's transfer pricing arrangements and taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. This also resulted in a net interest expense adjustment of $3.6 million. Excluding these items, the tax rate would have been 28.8% for the quarter.  Net income for the quarter was $53.2 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $60.5 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of the tax and related interest adjustments, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.35 per share for the third quarter of 2015. The negative impact to earnings from foreign currency this quarter was $0.03 per share.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 140.5 million versus 143.4 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 1.6 million shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $55.50 per share. At this point, we have approximately $100 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization and will continue to be opportunistic in completing the program. Capital expenditures were $42.9 million for the quarter, compared to $37.3 million in the third quarter last year.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $403.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $357.8 million or 56% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2014, which was in line with our expectations that third quarter growth would be similar to the second quarter. Looking forward, we now expect total inventories to remain similarly elevated at the end of Q4 before coming fully in line with our sales trend in Q1. This change in our inventory outlook is mainly due to intentional actions we have taken that will impact quarter end in-transit levels. Looking more closely at these projections, we still expect a sequential improvement in on-hand inventories at the end of Q4, but to a somewhat lesser degree than prior estimates due to our revised top line outlook for the quarter. And in fact, our November results reflect a meaningful reduction in on-hand inventory levels already.  The bigger change in our inventory projections is a result of actions we have taken that will increase our quarter end in-transit inventories. Specifically, these are : First, our success in shifting shipment modes from air to ocean will have the effect of increasing in transit at quarter end as we see the benefits of our enhanced supply chain processes and we reduce our reliance on air transit. And second, we made the decision to pull forward certain product flows into the latter part of Q4 to mitigate shipment risks related to the timing of Chinese New Year. This has the effect of increasing in-transit levels at quarter end, but is the correct call to project -- to protect our in-stock positions and the integrity of our assortments entering Q1 to deliver on our design intent. Additionally, we are also pleased with the results of our efforts to clear the excess inventory that we incurred as a result of the port disruption in Q1, and I'd like to recap where we stand now. You may recall, we identified 1.1 million units of excess inventory at the end of Q1. We also identified a plan to clear roughly 1/3 of this or 400,000 units through normal exit channels, while the balance would be incorporated in our normal product flows at full price in Q3 and Q4.  As of the end of Q3, we have cleared approximately 260,000 units through our exit channels, including our successful physical warehouse sale in Boston this past October. The remaining 140,000 units of clearance inventory will be sold through in Q4 via 2 physical warehouse sales that we now have planned, 1 in the U.S. and 1 in Canada as well as through our normal exit channels otherwise.  Of the remaining 2/3 of the Q1 excess that has been flowed at full price into the second half of the year, about half of this was sold in Q3 as part of our normal flows. The remainder will be sold in Q4 with a small portion incorporated into the first half of 2016. As a result of all the factors just mentioned, we now expect inventory levels to become fully aligned with forward sales in Q1 following the sequential improvements in on-hand inventories combined with the described increase in in-transit at the end of Q4.  This now leads me to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As Laurent mentioned, trends in our business have been mixed with traffic trends soft to start Q4 followed by some improvement since Thanksgiving. As a result, we are updating our prior guidance to reflect a Q4 revenue estimate in the range of $670 million to $685 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 and assumes a Canadian dollar at 0.75 to the U.S. dollar and 9 new store openings, 7 lululemon stores and 2 ivivva.  That said, we are in fact seeing the gross margin recovery in Q4 taking shape and expect this to continue and accelerate into 2016. But specifically for Q4, we now anticipate gross margin to be in the range of 49% to 50%. This sequential improvement reflects a number of positive factors, including stabilizing product margins as we move beyond port-related cost issues and benefit from leverage of air freight costs as utilization has declined significantly to last year; significant sequential improvement in occupancy and depreciation as expected, but still up year-over-year; and buying costs in line with last year.  Offsetting these positive factors are the continued impact of FX, actually the biggest quarterly impact of the year; an increase in markdowns to stay on top of inventory movement as our comp trend has moderated; and we expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to delever from Q4 2014, due in part to our lapping $7 million in FX gains that reduced reported SG&A in Q4 2014. The remaining increases causing deleverage are associated with investments in our global website redesign, supply chain consulting cost associated with delivering on our margin improvement initiatives and incremental digital marketing expenses during the fourth quarter that drive traffic and conversion.  Assuming a tax rate of 29.5% and 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.78 per share versus $0.78 a year ago. For the full year 2015, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.04 billion for the year. We now expect to open 61 company-operated stores, which includes up to 8 new stores in Asia and Europe and also 21 ivivva stores. We expect gross margin for the year to delever from 2014, impacted by the factors we mentioned earlier. We expect modest deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2014, driven by strategic investments in guest experience, supply chain, digital, brand and IT systems. We now expect a net negative impact to earnings from foreign exchange for the year to increase from approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share when compared to fiscal year 2014. As a result, we expect operating margin to delever from 2014 and our fiscal year 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.84. This is based off of 140.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q3 2015 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 27.6%, which includes the $0.03 tax benefit recorded in the third quarter. We expect capital expenditures to range between $135 million to $140 million for the fiscal year 2015, reflecting new store openings including outlets, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments.  We are pleased with the progress we have made in the third quarter. As we now have moved into Q4, the team remains laser focused on successfully executing all of our strategic initiatives. We will provide a detailed outlook for next year as part of our Q4 call in March, but we would like to reiterate our confidence in delivering gross margin recovery in 2016. The quarter-to-date margin trends we are now seeing reinforce this view. And at this point, we are deep into execution on the various programs that will deliver the margin improvements that will support this inflection and long-term profitability. As we've discussed, these programs and the related investments are focused on a few key areas that include reduction in air freight as we shift a higher portion of flows to ocean. This effort is beginning in Q4 of this year where we expect air utilization to be half of last year; improve logistics and duty costs; FOB cost improvements as we improve our demand planning, reduce cancellations and late stage change orders; and lastly, other efficiencies from a more disciplined go-to-market process, such as lower fabric liability and improved development ratios. These programs are all part of the evolution to a more sophisticated, scalable supply chain that can flow product more efficiently and consistently based on anticipated product life cycles. We have incurred consulting costs in both Q3 and Q4 to deliver on these programs next year, namely with Deloitte, who has been a catalyst to accelerating our efforts. Given the nature of these initiatives, we see gross margin recovery opportunity accelerating starting in the second quarter of 2016. We will see sequential improvement in Q1 gross margin, but also anticipate some impact in this period from steps we will take to fully align inventory levels. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, you mentioned the opportunities on the supply chain. Can you maybe just talk about the different buckets, maybe dig in a little bit to some quantification on where you're furthest along and just the timing on how you see those come through? It sounds like maybe some are happening a little earlier than planned in the fourth quarter, but just wondering how we should think about the total by bucket in F '16. Stuart Haselden : Yes. Paul, it's Stuart. So as we think about the margin improvement and the order of magnitude, we still see the potential -- we still expect to achieve the area of 300 basis points of product margin improvement versus 2014 pre-FX. But I think what we're seeing now that we're a little farther into 2015 and have more visibility on the first half of '16 that it'll likely take us into the first half of 2017 to fully achieve that level of margin recovery. But as you mentioned, we are seeing the opportunity taking shape in 2016, particularly beginning in the second quarter, and again -- but we will see improvement in margin in the first quarter but a greater inflection accelerating into the second quarter, and so we feel like the overall story is intact. We tried to lay out, in my prepared remarks, some of the primary buckets for how we'll deliver that, and I can give you a little color now on each of those. So as you look at the reductions in air freight, that's a big piece of the equation and one of the more tangible that we've been able to make, probably the most progress on -- in 2015. As I mentioned, we're seeing air freight utilization in the fourth quarter less than half of what it was in 2014. So that's going to translate into an important point of leverage for gross margins in the current quarter, in Q4. We see that extending into 2016. And to quantify it, we're looking at air utilization rates that are under 25%, where in much of the prior year, they were approaching 50%, north of 40% -- usually north of 40%. So that's a critical element that is tangible that we're seeing and meet your current benefits. The other areas, the improved logistics and duty costs, so on the logistics side, there's programs we've identified to optimize our mode utilization. All air freight isn't created equal, and there's different tiers of air that you can leverage at different levels of cost to the company. So we've identified ways to optimize that where we choose to use it. The same thing for ocean freight. It's not all created equal, and we've, again, identified where we can do a better job of flowing inventory through the supply chain, through the logistics elements of how we move product. And duty costs, there's just some pretty straightforward first sale opportunities we've identified that we're going to work on now. So again, those are, again, meaningful opportunities from a cost reduction standpoint. FOB cost improvements, this is really us getting our house in order. We've talked about this earlier in the year. Improving our demand planning, being able to look forward and have a more reliable estimate of our production requirements that we can take to our suppliers to deliver more consistent production requirements, reducing the amount of cancellations that we've seen, and as well, late stage change orders. All those things will improve our ability to lower our FOB costs. And then also, as I mentioned, the go-to-market process, more discipline around how we manage our fabric liability. We've taken some steps earlier in this year to clean up our positions. We feel like we should be in a good place to enter 2016 in that regard. And also, as our internal processes for product development improve, we can improve our development ratio, as I mentioned which, again, our -- is an important part of the liabilities that we generate to support our product process. So I mean, those are the big areas we'd like to identify and not going to break out sort of the details around each in terms of what they're worth, but each of those are meaningful and will be part of the overall recovery that we see really accelerating in Q2 of next year. Laurent Potdevin : And Paul, this is Laurent. What I might want to add quickly is with the structural changes that we've made and -- on the product side, I mean, being design-led certainly doesn't come at the expense of great merchandising, and I've already seen much greater collaboration between design and merchandiser resulting in a much more focused approach to the assortment, which will create better experiences for our guests, but also much more efficient targeted sourcing of our product, resulting in far greater margin. So I mean, I've seen the impacts that it will have both on the guest standpoint, but also the laser focus on a more streamlined supply chain. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Tunick with the Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : One question on the product side, and then one on the expense side. I guess on the product side, bottoms up, I think you said 27%, bras up 18%. Can you maybe talk about what are the biggest opportunities in the women's assortment next year? Where do you think there's the most white space to either relaunch or have a new category? And have you learned anything about your price opportunities given the newer high price point in the compression pants? And Stuart, on the expense side, can you maybe talk about the SG&A dollar growth? Obviously, there was some consulting costs in there. How much they may have been for the third or the fourth quarter, and are there any other management holes besides the supply chain head that we need to think about for 2016 SG&A dollar growth? Laurent Potdevin : Well, this is Laurent. I'll take the first part of the question. I mean, clearly, what we've learned and what we've known all along and where we probably lost our way the past 3 years that when we are bold and when we're innovative, our guests respond really well. And the response to the launch of the pant wall has been fantastic, so both from a fabrication, from an innovation standpoint, and we have actually seen price elasticity that was much greater than what we had originally anticipated, meaning that our guests really responded well to the value that we've provided. So when you look at the success of being bold, innovative and really delivering that kind of value, and when you look at the comp that we've had in pants and bra, it's obvious that the category that we need to be really focused on right now is tanks. And with Lee coming on as Creative Director, I mean, his first area of focus is clearly to deliver the same type of innovation both from a fabric, styling and construction standpoint that we have with the pant. So that is a very substantial opportunity for growth for us as you think about spring, summer 2016 and beyond. Stuart Haselden : Great. And Brian, it's Stuart. I'll speak to the -- to your SG&A question. So SG&A did come in high for the quarter versus our prior expectations. There were a few factors that explain where we landed, a couple of which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, but these -- there's really 3 things I'll call out. First, we did see about $3.4 million of increase in FX revaluation loss versus Q3 of last year. We also had about $1 million in severance that was not incorporated in our earlier estimates. And finally, consulting fees, which in total were around $2.5 million in the quarter related to our supply chain initiatives, primarily came in above our prior estimates. A portion of that was contemplated in the guidance, but there was some portion that was above what we expected. The combination of those factors accounted for over 100 basis points of deleverage that we saw in the quarter and essentially bridge us back to our original estimates. We're comfortable that these costs are onetime in nature and do not represent a permanent increase in our cost structure and really offer us an opportunity for leverage as we lap these costs into next year. And as you -- as we think about Q4, we do anticipate a meaningful amount of SG&A deleverage in Q4, and that's implied in the guidance that we gave, but to a somewhat lesser degree than what we saw in Q3. You also heard in our prepared remarks some of the factors that we pointed to that will affect SG&A in the fourth quarter, the biggest of these being the $7 million in FX gains in Q4 last year that we are now lapping. That by itself is about 100 basis points of pressure. Otherwise, we are continuing to invest in our supply chain initiatives. That's probably the largest of the factors otherwise. But we also have important investments in website redesign and our digital marketing efforts. As we look into 2016, it's -- we'll give -- we'll certainly give more detailed guidance around 2016 on our Q4 call. We'll continue to make investments to support the supply chain initiatives, which will likely be heavier in the first half of the year as we are -- as we draw closer to completing those key investments in that time frame. So hope that's helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I was hoping to get an update on the idea of having kind of gross margin parity or merchandise margin parity between seasonal and core. I haven't heard you talk about that in a while, and I'm not sure where you are on that initiative at this point. Stuart Haselden : It's not a great way, I think, that we would explain what's going on in our gross margin picture. I think we believe our seasonal products and our core products should both offer great margins that should lead to margin expansion from where we currently are. I guess what I would say is, we're 5, 6 weeks now into Q4, and we're excited to see that the efforts that we've been making over the course of the year are starting to get traction from a product margin standpoint. As we mentioned in the opening, we are seeing stabilizing product margins that are happening now in the fourth quarter as we begin to clear some of these port-related issues. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, air freight is an important source of leverage for us as the utilizations are coming in line with our targets and our supply chain begins to normalize. Occupancy and depreciation will also be a big point -- big part of leverage for our gross margin into -- in Q4, and then even a greater source of sequential improvement into 2016. And just to be clear, there'll still be deleverage in Q4, but just not as much as what we've seen in the earlier parts of the year related to occupancy and depreciation. FX will continue to be a headwind. We will have some increased markdowns in the fourth quarter so that we can stay on top of the inventory movement. We are committed to and aggressive in ensuring that we get our inventories rebalanced. But coming back to your question, Sharon, on sort of core versus seasonal, we are developing a merchandise segmentation strategy that will enable us to balance the product, different elements of our assortments based on the anticipated life of those, the product life of those different parts of the assortment. And that should give us an advantage in how we build supply chains to deliver those and capture margin opportunities. So again, I guess, the punchline here is that we think we should be able to deliver great margins on both seasonal and core products, and that's how we're drawing up our plans. Laurent Potdevin : And Sharon, looking at it from a pure product standpoint. I mean, looking at what's coming in, in spring and summer from a print technique, from a texture or from a construction standpoint. I mean I really -- I've said that all along. I mean, there's no reason why seasonal should deliver less margin than core, especially when you compound that with our scarcity strategy around the seasonal product. So we feel very confident that there shouldn't be any margin discrepancies between seasonal and core, and I actually think that we're not even thinking about seasonal and core that way anymore. And I'd love to take this opportunity to remind all of you that Miguel Almeida, who's leading digital, is on the call with us. And over the next few calls, I'd love to expose all of you to more of the management team. So obviously, digital is a center of excellence that we're building. Miguel has got a massive experience in that area. We're very excited about it and it's obviously a great opportunity for us. So if you've got questions for Miguel, don't make him feel bad for being silent here. Just ask him some questions. Operator : Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : On the success of pants and bras and men's, what were the product classifications that had more opportunity this quarter in terms of getting to your overall comp? And Stuart, on the markdown front, what -- which classifications had the markdown? And as you guided to markdowns for the Q4 period, does that mainly have to do with what you've articulated with your warehouse sales or what should we expect in store? And then, Miguel, on your side, buy online, pick up in store and mobile, they're major ideas for integrating bricks and clicks. Just curious on what are the next major hurdles in the flagship? The Flatiron flagship has a lot of interactivity, so wondering what we can see there for the innovation ahead. Laurent Potdevin : So Oliver, I'll take the least amount of time to answer your question. The largest opportunity right now for us is women's tanks. And Lee and Duke on the Brighton community side have actually put a fully dedicated team to just look at that opportunity and quickly bring product to life that we're proud of and that we love. So I'll leave it at that. That's clearly the biggest opportunity, one we're focused on. Stuart Haselden : And Oliver, it's Stuart. So the -- on the markdown question, there's a couple pieces there. Certainly, we have added activities, namely the physical warehouse sale, the online warehouse sale that we did earlier in the year and the 2 warehouse sales we now have teed up for the fourth quarter. Those certainly serve to increase the amount of markdowns that we have and are part of the guidance that we gave and the results in Q3. And otherwise, we are taking steps with regards to markdowns to make sure that we are staying on track with the clearance goals that we have to move through the inventory we have in an orderly manner. So in October, we did see -- we saw traffic slow in the final weeks of October. And there was some incremental markdown activity there to, again, stay on top of the inventory movement. We -- and the guidance that we have given for Q4 reflects the quarter-to-date activity and the -- as well our expectations at this point for the balance of the quarter in terms of actions we'll need to take to, again, stay on top of that inventory movement. Miguel Almeida : Yes, and this is Miguel. On the point of buy online and pick up in store, it's one of our critical initiatives to improve the guest experience across channels, something that our guests have been telling us that they really want to see from us. The RFID that we have in North America will enable us now to accelerate the testing, learning of those experiences, and -- but I'm mostly excited about what then the RFID technology, beacon technology, will help us learn about guest behavior as they are buying and browsing products in our stores. So that's -- it's one of the key priorities for us. We will learn significant things about the best way to implement these. The testing and learning on top of the RFID will help us do the right expansion in North America. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Miguel, I will actually take the opportunity to ask you a question because I'm very interested in the upcoming website relaunch. Can you maybe give us a little bit of highlight of some of the functionality that you're adding, maybe content that you plan to add or add over time? And how you plan to improve the overall experience comprehensively online with digital with this new website? Miguel Almeida : Yes. Thank you for the question, Matt. So we're very excited about the redesign coming in, in Q1. It's an outstanding opportunity for us to bring our brand content and commerce together. The current experience is very decoupled from a commerce and content perspective. The new website will allow us to bring those 2 elements into 1 cohesive experience for our guests, both across web and the mobile experience as well, but then -- and that, the redesign itself will be just step one in terms of our digital experience evolution. What gets me most interested is then the personalization capability that will come over the course of the year. We're investing significantly in building our CRM and analytics capability, and the new website will allow us to really deliver contextually relevant experiences to our guests that bring the storytelling of our product and brands into the digital space. And then we'll connect those guests with -- back with our stores as well through some of the capabilities that we were discussing before. So we're very excited about seeing the new site coming to life in Q1. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about the 300 basis points of product margin opportunity, I mean, is basically what you're saying at -- you're expecting aggregate gross margins positive in the first quarter of next year for us to think about a larger inflection in the second quarter? And then just on the phasing, I mean, is it fair to think about 200 of the 300 in 2016 with the remainder in 2017? Stuart Haselden : Hey, Matt, so let me try to sharpen what we said a little bit there. In Q1, we expect to see sequential improvement in gross margin year-over-year versus the prior quarter, meaning the Q4. So I think we're seeing -- we're going to see a nice sequential improvement in Q4 versus the quarter we just reported, but still will likely be down year-over-year. As we get into Q1 of 2016, we'll see a further sequential improvement in gross margin, again, as our work to improve our supply chain efficiency and all the things we mentioned takes -- gets farther along. I didn't say necessarily that gross margin in Q1 would be up. We'll give more specific guidance in -- on our Q4 call, but I think what we are comfortable committing to is that we will see a sequential improvement in Q1. We see greater opportunity in Q2 and beyond in 2016 to see a greater inflection in our product margin and gross margin opportunities, and that's a combination of, again, just being farther along in the initiatives that we have. The FOB cost improvements in particular are going to be more second half weighted than first half, and there will likely be some actions we'll take that will weigh on margins related to just getting our inventories aligned in the first quarter. So I'm not going to put a number on what that product margin improvement looks like in 2016 today. We'll be able to speak with more precision to that again on the Q4 call. But I guess, conceptually, we're just saying, given what we know now about inventory flows into the first half of 2016, we still feel confident about the order of magnitude of inflection that we can achieve being consistent with that 300 basis points pre-FX product margin back to 2014, but it's likely going to take us a little bit more time into 2017 -- first half of 2017 to fully achieve that. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up, to circle back on the inventory, what's the best way to think about the content of the excess product? And then just to be clear on that, so are you basically saying that versus your initial plan for the on-hand reduction, you really only stand 10,000 units behind plan, which is about 4% below that game plan to clear 260. Is that kind of the best way to think about where you're at today versus what you had laid out 3 months ago and then just the go-forward content? Stuart Haselden : That's right. I think our -- what we had laid out was 100,000 units in Q3. We came in around 90,000, so still feel good. Directionally, that keeps us on track, and we'll be able to complete that part of the plan in the fourth quarter as we had described. But again, the biggest change in the inventory outlook for Q4 is really that in-transit, the decisions we made around it, we feel strongly that those are the right calls. We think otherwise it would be shortsighted to not ensure that we're protecting our flows into the first quarter. And otherwise, not take advantage from a margin standpoint of our ability now to shift from air to ocean. The consequence of that unfortunately increases our in-transit at the end of Q4. But nonetheless, again, we feel strongly those are the right decisions. I think what we will plan to do at the end -- as part of our Q4 call, we'll break out and provide some details on our on-hand inventory levels versus the in-transit so that we can demonstrate the degree to which our on-hand inventories are coming in line, and also quantify what the impact on the -- of the in-transit increase will have been. Matthew Boss : Okay, great. And then just one housekeeper, are same-store sales quarter-to-date in line with the fourth quarter mid-single-digit guidance? Stuart Haselden : I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Matthew Boss : Are same-store sales so far, quarter-to-date, in line with the fourth quarter guidance for mid-single digits? Stuart Haselden : Yes. So I think how I would answer that is that the next few weeks of the quarter in December are huge weeks from a volume standpoint. We're also up against a little tougher comparison in these weeks, and our comp assumption is probably just under the mid-single-digit range. So we're a little more conservative over the next few weeks in regards to the comp in that time frame, more conservative than we are for the quarter overall, if that makes sense. Chris Tham : Operator, we've now run out of time for questions. Again, thank you everyone for joining us today. We'll talk again soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, SVP of Finance. You may begin. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; Stuart Haselden, CFO; and Lee Holman, EVP, Creative Director, who will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K will be available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I will turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure today to share the results of a very solid fourth quarter. I will speak to some highlights of 2015 as well as our priorities into 2016 and beyond. Stuart will then walk you through our financial and guidance in more detail. 2015 was a transformative year for lululemon, one where we successfully reached key milestones that are positioning us for continued growth and improved profitability over the next 5 years. The strength that lululemon demonstrated in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations as a result of continued top line momentum, focus on growth margin and inventory levels. While we have room to improve, we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth in 2016. From a top line perspective, the fourth quarter delivered 22% constant currency revenue growth, including exceptional full-price sell-through during the key holiday weeks. We delivered an 11% global combined comp, the result of accelerating performance across our channels and regions. Our e-commerce revenues continued to outpace our overall growth, posting a 33% increase in the quarter. While inventory levels are still elevated, they are significantly lower than our prior estimates. This reduction happened while delivering growth margins above the high end of our guidance. In looking more closely at the results in the quarter, we see exciting momentum by category, channel and geography. Our women's category continued its strong performance in Q4, with bottoms delivering double-digit comps, reflecting the continued strength of our product assortment. The successful launch of Engineered Sensation with new technical fabrics and innovative construction techniques drove the business, led by the new Align Pant, designed to minimize distraction and maximize comfort. We also saw a sequential improvement in women's tops, where comps turned positive in the quarter, led by the success of our seamless program. And I'm actually excited to see what will come next with the Align Pant, as we launch the new Align Crop in the next couple of weeks. Our men's category continued to outpace our overall growth with another strong comp of 24%, driven by our sweat category. It's been exciting to see the acceleration in men's, as we build on the continued success of franchise items such as our Metal Vent tees, our short program and our ABC pants. With a total penetration to sales of just 16% and a renewed focus on creative direction, we're only getting started in the men's category. Our North American stores posted accelerating comps versus the highest prior year comparison, supported by strong full-price sell-through in the peak holiday sales period. The quality of sales speaks to our unrivaled product performance and to our educators who deliver exceptional experiences that are unique in the retail landscape today. Canada showed a strong trend in Q4 that continued into the first quarter. We are so proud of our Canadian business and the performance in our home market. It speaks to the loyalty of our guests and the strength and scalability of our brand globally. Within our North American footprint, we increased our square footage by 15% in 2015 through new stores, store optimization and expansion. We opened our new West Edmonton Mall, which is now double its original size and is the most productive store in the world. We opened our Flatiron store in New York, introducing HUB seventeen, our community space. We've now also brought our lab concept to the United States with our first location, which opened yesterday on Bond Street in New York. lululemon lab is our hub of creativity for functional and experimental design that tapes into the culture, trends and technology of the people and places it celebrates. We are excited about what our teams can do in this new location, and we'll continue to look for the right opportunities to grow our footprint strategically in key markets. As I turn to our digital culture, we are building an ecosystem that will create unique experiences for our guests. As I mentioned earlier, our e-commerce revenue in Q4 grew over 30% to just over 20% of total sales in the quarter. This will only continue to increase as we expand our digital business model, with the introduction of innovative digital experiences, leveraging CRM capabilities and the expansion of more sophisticated digital marketing strategies. I am thrilled to see what Miguel and his team are doing as we continue to build out channel-agnostic strategies for our guests to engage with lululemon whenever, however and wherever they want to. Internationally, we continued to make important progress in Q4 towards our expansion goals. In Europe, we remained focused on winning in London, where we opened another great location in Q4 at Westfield mall. And we are finalizing exciting new locations in capital cities around the world, including Seoul and Tokyo. Our success is based on the discipline and commitment to go to market when our communities are vibrant and pulling us in. It is a nimble, powerful and unique strategy that further solidifies our footprint as we expand our global presence. 2015 was a pivotal year in which comps accelerated, margins stabilized and critical infrastructure was established. Last month, we completed our management team with the arrival of Gina Warren, our Executive Vice President of Talent and Culture, to lead, nurture and evolve our most important asset, our people. lululemon now has a full management team in place, a diverse group of global citizens, incredibly talented and deeply ingrained in our culture. This team is more aligned than ever with our goal of building a highly profitable global brand. Our deliberate focus on being design-led is fueling our growth, and our focus on operational excellence is driving our earnings expansion. In addition to the highlights I've already mentioned, we also saw important progress in building key capabilities to support how we will scale the business in the coming years. First, we made traditional investments in our product design and innovation capabilities, reorganizing our Whitespace team as well as our design and merchandising team. We established the brand's first-ever Creative Director role and appointed Lee Holman to drive our design-led approach. This drive to unify men's and women's is creating greater alignment and a strengthened brand vision. As a result, the role of Senior Vice President, men's, held by Felix del Toro, has been eliminated. I want to personally thank Felix for his important contribution over the past couple of years. Second, our supply chain was and continues to be a major focus for us this year. We've made important steps towards building a reliable and scalable supply chain to bring to life our design vision. And I'm delighted to announce the hiring of Ted Teknisi [ph], who has joined us in the role of Chief Supply Chain Officer. Ted is an industry veteran who will bring his leadership and experience to the tremendous amount of progress that was made these past couple of years. Looking forward to 2016 and the next 5 years, we're excited and ready to leverage the capabilities we built in 2015, as we resume earnings expansion and scale our business as an originator of brand. By 2020, our plan is to double our revenue and more than double our earnings. We will achieve this through 4 distinct growth strategies : first, product innovation. It is central to how we continue to create transformational experiences for our guests to live and breathe the sweat life. Our products are rooted in function, and our designers mandate it to be proud of every single product they create. Specifically, we will focus on 2 areas : building our women's sweat category to include expanding and improving our tops business with the same focus we've had on bottoms. Our product assortments in the second half of 2016 will capture that substantial opportunity and growth potential. The other major product opportunity is the continued expansion of our men's category. With a focused creative [ph] vision, we will see continued disruptive innovation in product. Our focus will be on training, run and yoga as we elevate and diversified our stable offering and build out our seamless program. The second growth driver is the continued store buildout in North America. Square footage growth in the U.S. will continue to be a key component of our strategy to fully develop current communities, and we are continuing to open new stores where we have underserved markets. And the third growth driver is the ramp-up of our digital culture, as we scale our uniquely lululemon guest experiences in ways that are channel-agnostic and global. Our vision is to design and nurture a digital ecosystem that amplifies human experiences, relationships and connections. Digital is a critical platform for us to tap into the power of our collective [ph], both online and offline, allowing us to continue engaging with our guests in an authentic and personalized way. As our guests increasingly engage with us online, this channel will continue to grow rapidly and likely will account for more than 1/4 of our business by 2020. We are laying the foundation for our long-term digital capabilities by building out our core functions in areas such as analytics, digital product management and digital marketing; enhancing our guest experience with a mobile-first mindset to connect digital and physical experiences; strengthening our e-commerce operations and igniting digital marketing based on a powerful new CRM platform. This insight will give us the ability to interact with our guests in ways we haven't been able to before and will drive traffic and conversion across all of our channels. And lastly, the fourth growth driver as we look forward to 2020 is our international expansion. We are continuing to focus our expansion in key capital markets to build brand awareness. This will support future and broader store expansion in those types of geographies. We expect to open 11 stores in 2016 and further accelerate in 2017 and beyond. Combined with our e-commerce business, we expect international to account for 20% to 25% of the business by 2020. In pursuing these growth drivers, we will remain true to the pillars of our brand operating model that you've heard described us now for over a year : our product, our guest experience and our brand and community. Under the leadership of Lee Holman, the product organization will deliver product growth by applying our unique perspective and insights into solving problems for athletes, designing with the lens of functional innovation and impeccable craftsmanship. Guest experience has and always will be a differentiator at lululemon. Within our physical location, we see further opportunities in expanding and enhancing our experiences as we evolve our footprint and as we build our digital culture. We expect our store portfolio to be a combination of our standard 3,000 square-foot store, larger format in key high-volume locations and smaller format stores that are relevant for smaller markets of destination resource location. And finally, brand and community is a diverse ecosystem of activity that fosters storytelling and nurtures relationship with our guests in stores, on our digital platform and through experiences in our local communities. Our unique grassroot model continues to be incredibly powerful and relevant. When combined with our investment in public relations and a digital platform, it is getting amplified on a global scale. So as we look to the start of 2016, our outlook for the year is healthy with a return to solid earnings growth. This is a culmination of the foundation and infrastructure we've put in place over the past couple of years while creating a high-performance culture focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth, putting us well on our way to achieving our 5-year goal of doubling our revenues and more than doubling our earnings. With that, I'll now turn things over to Stuart to review our financial results and provide guidance for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter of 2015 and highlights from the year. I'll then provide details for our outlook for 2016 and the first quarter. I will also provide further details of our growth plans for the next 5 years, as Laurent has described. The fourth quarter was an important period for us as we posted accelerating double-digit comps against our highest prior period comparisons of the year. We also made improvements in our product margins and solid progress in realigning our inventories, which helps set the stage for the recovery and profitability in 2016 that we had been building towards this past year. Turning to the details. Q4 total net revenues rose 16.9% to $704.3 million, with the increase in revenue driven by several factors that include : a total constant dollar comparable sales growth of 11%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 5% and an e-commerce comp of 33%; and also an increase in square footage of 20% versus last year, driven by the addition of 61 net new company-operated stores since Q4 of 2014, 30 net new stores in the United States, 2 stores in Canada, 5 in Europe, 3 in Asia and 21 ivivva stores. And finally, these factors were offset by the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $28.3 million or 4.7%. During the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new company-operated stores, 6 in the U.S., 1 in Europe and 2 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 363 total stores versus 302 a year ago. There are now 284 stores in our comp base, 41 of those in Canada, 188 in the United States, 31 in Australia and New Zealand, 1 in Europe, 1 in Asia and 22 ivivva. At the end of Q4, we also had a total of 84 showrooms in operation : 25 lululemon showrooms in North America, 21 internationally and 38 ivivva. Company-operated stores represented 72.3% of total revenue. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $146.3 million or 20.8% of total revenue compared to 19% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-up stores, warehouse sales and outlets, totaled $48.9 million versus $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $354.5 million or 50.3% of net revenue compared to $310 million or 51.5% of net revenue in Q4 2014. The factors which contributed to this 120 basis point decline in gross margin were : 30 basis points of overall product margin increase, primarily driven by stabilizing initial merchandising margins, lower airfreight costs, offset with higher markdowns compared to Q4 2014; 110 basis points of decline due to the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar; and 20 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation, and 20 basis points of deleverage and product and supply chain overhead costs. SG&A expenses were $188.2 million or 26.7% of net revenue compared with $152.9 million or 25.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. This 23% SG&A dollar increase is due to the following : an increase in operating expenses associated with new and existing stores, showrooms and outlets; increased variable operating costs associated with the growth in our e-commerce channel, including digital marketing expenses; increased head office costs associated with strategic investments and supply chain consulting expenses associated with our gross margin improvement plan initiatives. These items were offset with a stronger U.S. dollar, which, on translation, decreased reported SG&A by $13.7 million or 6.2%, along with an increase in foreign exchange revaluation gains of $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result, operating income for the fourth quarter was $166.3 million or 23.6% of net revenue compared with $157.2 million or 26.1% of net revenue in Q4 2014. The tax rate was 29.8% compared to 30.3% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $117.4 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to net income of $110.9 million or $0.78 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. The negative net impact to earnings from foreign currency in this quarter was $0.03 per share. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 138.2 million versus 142.4 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 2.1 million shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $49.52 per share. We now have completed a total of 421.5 million in total share repurchases, with approximately $28.5 million remaining on our original authorization. Capital expenditures were $35.4 million for the quarter compared to $30.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Turning to the highlights for our full fiscal year 2015 performance. Net revenue was $2.061 billion, up 20% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a 10% comparable sales growth. E-commerce sales totaled $401.5 million or 19.5% of total sales. Gross profit was $997.2 million or 48.4% of net revenue compared to $914.2 million or 50.9% of net revenue in fiscal 2014. Net income for the year was $266 million or $1.89 per diluted share compared to $239 million or $1.66 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. This is based off of an effective tax rate of 27.8% in 2015 versus a 37.6% effective tax rate in 2014. Normalized for transfer pricing and repatriation tax adjustments, our adjusted EPS was $1.86 for fiscal year 2015 compared to $1.89 in 2014. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $501.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $284 million or 36% higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. This marks a sequential improvement to our inventory levels from the end of Q3 that was better than our prior estimates. This improvement was the result of 3 factors : first, the higher sales outcome enabled us to move through more inventory than previously estimated; secondly, we took incremental markdowns in the quarter to help address the overhang from prior periods; and lastly, we saw more favorable in-transit levels that were generally in line with the overall year-over-year increase for the quarter. The improvement to our prior estimates for in-transit inventory related primarily to refinements in the timing of shipments impacted by Chinese New Year. We are, in fact, seeing inventory levels rebalance with sales now that we are deep into Q1. So we remain confident that our inventories will be well aligned with forward sales at the end of the quarter. Turning to our outlook for 2016. We now see our plans for a recovery in profitability coming into sharper focus. At this point, most of our assortment plans for the year are set, and we have visibility to the gross margin inflection that we will deliver beginning in Q2 and continuing through the second half of the year. This inflection, combined with continued strong comp sales momentum, will drive the recovery in earnings growth we have been working towards over the last year. Q1 will mark the last step in our transition to regaining earnings growth as we complete our work to rebalance our inventory levels and extend efforts to strengthen our supply chain capabilities. Turning now to the details of our Q1 and fiscal year 2016 outlook. We expect revenues in Q1 to be in the range of $483 million to $488 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the first quarter of 2015 and assumes the Canadian dollar at CAD 0.75 to the U.S. dollar and 8 new store openings. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 47%. The factors driving this are : continued improvements in product margins as we benefit from lower air freight usage and improved initial merchandise margins. This is partially offset with higher markdowns as we work through the inventory overhang from prior periods. The impact of FX from a weaker year-over-year Canadian and Australian dollar, which is the largest headwind to gross margin; moderate occupancy and depreciation deleverage, although improved versus last year; and finally, slight deleverage in product and supply chain expenses. We expect SG&A in the first quarter to delever significantly from Q1 2015, primarily due to currency revaluation losses that we anticipate in the quarter as a result of the significant strengthening of the Canadian dollar over the last 2 months. We anticipate that approximately half of this deleverage for the quarter will result from currency revaluation. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 138 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 per share versus $0.34 a year ago. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.285 billion to $2.335 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits. We expect to open up to 44 company-operated stores, which includes up to 11 new stores in Asia and Europe, and also 12 ivivva stores. This represents a square footage increase of approximately 12%. As we have mentioned, we expect gross margin for the year to increase from 2015 beginning with a positive inflection starting in Q2 and carrying forward each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year. We will deliver this gross margin improvement from several areas, including reduction in air freight, as we shift a higher portion of product flows to ocean freight; improved logistics costs, as we optimize mode selection for the movement of our goods; improved duty costs, as we pursue identified first-sale opportunities; FOB cost improvements, as we improve our demand planning, reduce cancellations and late-stage change orders; and lastly, other efficiencies from a more disciplined go-to-market process such as lower fabric liability and improved development ratios. We expect modest deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2015, driven by strategic investments in supply chain, digital, guest experience, brand and IT systems. We expect higher deleverage in the first half of the year due to the currency revaluation impact expected in Q1, with the second half planned roughly flat to last year. As a result, we expect operating margin to lever from 2015 for 2016 overall, with some improvements beginning in Q2 and accelerating in the second half of the year. We expect our fiscal year 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share. This is based off of 138 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q4 2015 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 30.2%. This includes an estimate of an overall net negative impact to earnings from foreign exchange for the year of approximately $0.06 per share when compared to fiscal year 2015. We expect capital expenditures to range between $150 million and $155 million for the fiscal year 2016, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments. We're excited for 2016, a year when we will continue the top line momentum from 2015, rebalance our inventories, recover our product margins, resume double-digit earnings growth and extend our growth strategies, as Laurent described. As we look beyond 2016, we see a compelling growth model emerging, with economics that are well within the company's past performance levels. Laurent outlined the 4 growth strategies that collectively will enable us to double our revenues to roughly $4 billion by 2020. Looking more closely at each of these, we see a convincing case for this level of growth. First, our continued investments in product innovation are building a pipeline of new technology, fabrics and designs that will be a foundation for the mid-single-digit comps we expect to deliver over the next 5 years. Our pant wall launch this year helped deliver a 19% increase in women's bottoms from September to January. And we are eager to see what Tom and Lee will do with women's tops later this year. This game-changing level of innovation will be the catalyst to enable growth in our women's category to reach approximately $3 billion in total revenues by 2020. Our men's category might be even more exciting, posting an average quarterly increase of 20% over the last 10 quarters. Given this growth trend, it is not a stretch to expect our men's category to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2020. Secondly, the continued buildout of our North American store fleet offers the lowest beta part of the growth story. With much runway remaining in the U.S., this region will deliver a major portion of the double-digit total square footage growth we expect in the coming years. This will include both new stores as well as expansions and relocations, the latter being an important evolution of our real estate strategy. We are also now incubating several new real estate formats that we'll talk more about later in the year. The third growth strategy, our digital business, continues to deliver strong momentum, and the work Miguel and team are up to has everyone here excited, so much runway with essentially no cap on the upside. This has been an important part of our comp story, with annual e-commerce sales growth over 20% every year since the site launched in 2009, and we're only now reaching 20% penetration. We expect that this business will reach 25%, 30% or more of the total revenues for the company over the next 5 years, new website, new CRM and customer analytics, new digital marketing and new leadership. Very excited for what the team is building. And finally, international. It's hard to overstate the potential for us in Asia and Europe over the next 5 years. As Laurent described, we expect international to reach 20% to 25% of our total revenues over the next 5 years. We also expect international to be accretive to earnings by the end of 2017. Looking beyond top line expansion. We continue to see our operating profit recovering to the low 20s, led by the recovery in our gross margins. This recovery began in Q4 2015, continues in the current quarter and accelerates in Q2 and into the second half of the year. We see much of the margin recovery happening by 2018 with more modest improvements through 2020. And to be clear, this simply represents a reversion to the mean of where our gross margin has performed previously, certainly not extending our model into uncharted waters. And regarding SG&A, we expect modest leverage over the next 5 years. Importantly, our strong top line growth should enable a virtuous cycle of reinvestment to fuel our growth drivers going forward. We are obviously excited about our potential in 2016 and over the next 5 years, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, I open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Regarding the unification of men's and women's, what do you think we should expect in terms of what may happen to men's just because the momentum has been so strong there? And also, as we look forward, you did mention that your inventories are a little bit more than you would have liked. Which products is that related to? And Laurent, if you could highlight anything we should expect with the women's tops momentum and innovation there, that would be helpful for as we think about modeling the back half. Laurent Potdevin : I think that was 4 questions in a row. So I'll pick up the men's question. I want to remind everybody that we've got Lee in the room with us. But really, the unification of men's and women's under one overarching vision is really just strengthening the brand. So when you think about telling global stories of functional raw materials or construction, I mean, now we have a platform that really is much larger than it was before. And I always talk about Ocean and Duke, our muses, being able to share a walk-in closet, and we are one brand. So I'm very, very excited about the power, the unification and truly being design-led, as Lee build his organization. So Lee, I'll let you chime in on that. But it's really the first time that, as an organization, we are design-led across men's and women's, both from a functional and from a design standpoint. Lee Holman : Yes. I'm just really excited about 2016 and beyond. And it already starts from moving from a house of brands to a branded house. And what I mean is just aligning under one creative vision, having a pipeline of innovation that taps into men's and women's, think of the Engineered Sensation, how you can take that platform and build it from a men's and women's point of view. So I'm just really excited about driving the men's and women's business forward and a constant stream of like innovative product that we can bring to our guests. Stuart Haselden : And Oliver, it's Stuart. So on your question regarding inventory, and I think you're asking any specific categories we would call out in terms of the current inventory balance. First, I'll say, we're pleased with the improvement that we saw in the quarter. I would offer that the inventory balances are very current, and we're not seeing any deterioration and aging. There's not a specific category, I'd say, we're particularly heavy. And I think we're -- as we look forward for the year, we expect to see inventories, by Q1, come in line with our forward sales trend. Inventories over the course of the year may even begin to look lean, I think, on a 2-year basis versus our sales trend that will look appropriate. But we're pleased with the progress that we made on the inventory balances, as I said, and no particular categories I'd call out. Laurent Potdevin : And Lee, do you want to touch real quick on the question around tops? Lee Holman : Yes. I think on the women's tops business, and we can look at the men's as well. It's really having a real heightened focus and obsession around how do we bring balanced assortment of newness, and also how do we make it easier to outfit within stores and on digital with our bottoms business. So really offsetting around how color and print work together, how different textures -- one of the biggest callout that we're hearing from our ambassadors and our athletes is technical in the bottom and natural on top. And we're really covering that with our new assortment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Lee, the question is for you. Can you talk about -- before you got there, there was this kind of push and pull and a balancing between core basics and the seasonal product. And I'm wondering how that strategic direction has changed under your vision. And then for Stuart, if you can talk about merch margin recovery over this long-range plan that you've laid out for us. Where can the merch margins return back to, say, over time? Lee Holman : I think coming in a year ago in October, I think it's really around how do we heighten up those functional, seasonal stories with newness and new silhouettes that we are hearing from our ambassadors and our athletes, but also with a balanced offensive classification excellence. And I'm really proud of every product that we constantly put out. Core is constantly evolving. We always look at our fits. We look at how things are shifting really to more of a high rise rather than a low rise. I mean, that's something we're hearing from our guests. And I think what's very unique about coming here in lululemon is just the constant feedback we're getting from our regional managers, our store managers and our ambassadors that we can really react to shifts in trends. And also what's really exciting is just about how people are working out very differently. Shifting to more of these hybrid classes that are combining high-sweat activities and low-sweat kind of activities like yoga is moving and we're moving with yoga, which is really exciting, and then tap it into training and run, that Laurent talked about earlier, with new innovative product. Just so excited about, as we get through this year and beyond, with the new innovative experiences that myself and Tom will bring in. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Great. Yes, Adrienne, so on merchandise margins, as you suggested, as we're looking forward in terms of the recovery, what I would say is we see in the second half of the year, the anticipated recovery in product margins or merchandise margin taking shape consistent with our product expectations. We see this extending into the first half of next year as planned and beyond. And we think we can achieve the level of recovery that we had targeted previously and communicated with investors. That said, I would like to shift the focus here to gross margin in our discussions, where we can provide more transparent guidance to investors. And I think that's likely what you intended with your question anyway. We'll certainly provide details on the components of gross margin as we go forward, but ultimately, that's the metric we have to improve in order to drive recovery in our operating profit. And so specifically on your question of where we think we can get back to, I think we still feel like the low 50s in aggregate for gross margin is where we can recover our gross margins. That will be the primary impetus for a recovery in our operating margins to the low 20s. We don't see that changing. We think over the next 5 years, we should be able to get back to that level of performance. And we'll continue to provide update as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about traffic versus ticket on that plus 5 store comp? And what assumptions are built in to your comp guidance for '16 at the store level versus e-com? And then, within that store assumption, again, traffic versus ticket. And just bigger picture, can you talk about pricing power you think you might have? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Paul, so to make sure I hit this right, so we'll -- I'll give you some color on what we saw in traffic, Q4 and into Q1, and then just talk about how it connects to our comp outlook. So we have seen positive store traffic in the first quarter, both in stores and online for sure. And that's really against the backdrop of a pretty challenging retail environment. That said, the traffic has not been as strong in the first quarter as we had experienced in the fourth quarter. And then thinking about how that connects to our comp guidance, we planned comps for the year and for the first quarter at mid-single digit. That's how we're bought. And certainly, if the guest votes above this, we can do better. But at this point, we feel like that guidance for our comps is appropriate, and that's certainly reflective of the traffic trends that we're seeing in the first quarter. As we think about looking back at Q4, with the really strong traffic, the other factor that buoyed our comp results in the fourth quarter was just a very strong AUR outcome. And that connects, I think, to your ticket question. So certainly, traffic and AUR were the drivers of the comp performance in the fourth quarter. I would say that's largely extended into the first quarter, although, as I just mentioned, we're -- it's tempered by some moderation in the traffic trends in the first couple of months in the quarter. Laurent Potdevin : As far as your question, I mean, just to chime in real quick on pricing power. I mean, I think first of all, pricing power is dangerous because it's chipping at the equity of the brand, where we think we have tremendous power in innovation. And when we deliver innovation and value for our guests, we actually do have pricing power. And that was very clearly validated when we relaunched our pant wall and also with our men's business. So as long as we're focused on innovation and as long as we deliver innovation across categories and across gender, I mean, we have tremendous pricing power. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : I guess, Stuart, I want to focus on the international side. So 11 openings this year from, I think, 9 last year. And then in the prepared remarks, you mentioned by 2020, getting to about 20% or 25% of sales, which is a pretty big jump from today. So I guess my question is, can you help us understand how you get there in terms of new door growth versus productivity? And then can you talk about the ramp in profitability there from what, I guess, is losses today to breakeven next year to what kind of contribution you'd expect by 2020? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Thanks, Ike. So to be clear, that 20% to 25% does include our Australia business, which we have about 30 stores today in Australia and New Zealand. But certainly, the bigger part of the story is with the acceleration of our growth in Asia and Europe. And so certainly, we're building a pipeline of showrooms in each of those geographies that we believe will support an acceleration in store openings in the coming years. And then as we think about just those 2 geographies, we're particularly excited about the results that we're seeing in Asia. We've seen strong results or strong performance in the new stores we've opened in Singapore and Hong Kong. We're targeting other capital cities in the region, Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing, in the near future for new stores that we're just -- we think will be particularly successful both in terms of profit and the total volume that the stores will generate. We're also pleased with the traction that we're getting in London. We've had some important openings in London. We've got 3 or 4 more teed up for this year, really focusing on building our brand awareness in this pretty critical capital city for that region to help drive the brand awareness. And that's -- the strategy is such that we're balancing, executing our proven showroom strategy that helps us derisk these new store openings, seed brand awareness, seed demand in those markets with developing a stronger brand awareness regionally through opening these high-profile stores in these capital cities. So certainly, as you think about the profitability, we think we'll reach a point by the end of next year, where we'll have a critical scale, particularly in Asia and Europe, where we believe we can begin to leverage our overhead. And that should accelerate beyond '17, as we achieve greater and greater scale. I wouldn't look at the number of openings that we've had in '15 and '16 as a straight line. We will expect that we'll be able to increase the store opening cadence as we get deeper into the 5-year plan that we've outlined. Laurent Potdevin : And remember that we've got a very focused strategy. I seek capital cities to raise brand awareness. So later this year, we'll be actually announcing a couple of different go-to-market strategy to really increase that. So we're being very innovative and curious in how we can accelerate, how quickly we run brand awareness in those capital cities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about same-store sales by category, can you talk about comp performance, those tops versus bottoms in the fourth quarter, specific initiatives just to expect this year in tops and really the best way to think about bottoms in the back half just lapping the pant wall? And then finally, on the first quarter, what have you seen in February and March versus the mid-single-digit comp guide? I think any color would be really helpful. Stuart Haselden : Okay, Matt, it's Stuart. Maybe I'll speak to your latter question on the Q1 trends, which really is sort of along the same lines of what Paul asked a few minutes ago. And I'll turn it over to Lee to kind of talk about the plans we have and the trends that we've seen in women's tops and bottoms. So in Q1, as we mentioned, we've set the comp guidance at mid-single digit. We have seen traffic, while positive in the first quarter, not quite as strong as it had been in Q4. So we feel like the mid-single-digit guidance is appropriate. That said, as I mentioned, if our guests vote above this, there's potential to do better than that. But at this point, we feel like this is -- that guidance is appropriate. And really, as we think about the KPIs that underline that comp guidance, it's really the same story from the fourth quarter where we're seeing improvements in AUR and modest positive traffic in the first quarter that get us to that comp outlook. So hopefully that answers your question regarding Q1. And Lee, can you speak to... Lee Holman : Yes. I think, on our tops business, we're really excited at how we're getting to the back end of the quarters around bringing newness into our tops business, if it's from a natural point of view, from a fabrication and more technical soul and really looking about how we layer in a system of dress, which is really around back about harmonies and tops. So how is your first layer, your second layer work for your outerwear, so that when you go into storytelling in the stores or when the guests come in, it's really easy to outfit. And then what I'm really excited about the bottoms business, it's really extended to Engineered Sensation platforms that we did in Q4, and then adding new fabrications that really heighten out those sensations. So you're going to see a lot more new fabrication, a new execution on printing techniques within our pant wall as well and more obsession around craftsmanship as well, really driving this notion around engineering rather than veneering. That's really engineering the fabric, really getting back to those design principles around fit, fabrication, silhouette and finish, and really going back about how lululemon's really started with the fabrication around luon, the unique properties around that. And also it made you look amazing, so how do we get back into that and driving innovation from all the product that we're driving? And I'm really excited about how we're bringing these innovation products for the next year and beyond. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : I guess one question, just maybe give us an update... Laurent Potdevin : Brian, we can barely hear you. Brian Tunick : Is that better? Laurent Potdevin : Not really. Go ahead. Brian Tunick : Just on the supply chain and your design calendar and lead times, just maybe give us an idea of what's happened over the last year or 2? How long does it take to get product in the store? What kind of testing are you doing? Just an overall view point there. And then the second question is on omni-channel, your new DTC launch. Can you maybe talk about timing? Where are you on some of the projects there? Stuart Haselden : Brian, it's Stuart. So on your first question, in terms of the supply chain and the product calendar, fundamentally, the timetable for how we bring products to market is unchanged. And we're really operating on essentially a 9-month seasonal calendar, where we're making financial commitments probably 4 to 5 months out. And the balance of that 9 months is related to design and development. So I mean, that's largely unchanged. Certainly, we're always looking for ways to improve that timing and create flexibility. Our fast-turn strategy is really the most prominent way we've tried to do that in terms of leveraging fabric that we own into trends that we see emerging in stores on a shorter lead time. And that's, I think, a well-understood strategy we've had. We're always looking to try to grow that where it makes sense to, again, create a greater degree of flexibility to respond closer to market. So I hope that answers your question there. On the omni-channel and direct-to-consumer, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, a lot going on. Miguel is rapidly building an impressive team. We're making a lot of important technological investments. We had mentioned, I think, previously that we are building towards a new launch for our website. That is definitely still the case. That website is now live internally, and we're testing and looking at a launch externally to our guests in early Q2. So plans there are on track as we had previously described. I mean, additionally, from an omni-channel standpoint, it's important to mention the work that we're doing at CRM. So we're building new customer analytic capabilities that the company has never had. And that will enable us to better tailor, better craft our communication with guests in a sophisticated way that we just have never done. It will give us better understanding of our customer segments, how they're performing, how they're trending, what's working, what's not, so that we can just become a stronger, more customer-centric business. And then connecting that with the technological improvements in RFID, how we're connecting our pools of inventory across channels so that we can meet our guests, as Laurent described, in a channel-agnostic manner so that we're able to connect those experiences between stores and online more seamlessly. So that's a big part of the growth strategies over the next 4 years. It was one of the 4 that Laurent had mentioned, and it's certainly something we're investing aggressively behind. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Alexander of BB&T. Paul Alexander : Any learnings from the New York Flatiron stores so far? And then just a broader question about flagship stores. It sounds like the international strategy will rely heavily on capital cities. Will North America get any more kind of flagship stores? Laurent Potdevin : I think we -- this is Laurent. I think we talked about that on the last call. I want to be really clear when we talk about flagship store. And what we've got is that we've got a very proven, powerful formula with our 3,000 square-foot stores, and we're experiencing with more formats. So whether it's a larger format or a smaller format in a resort, beach mountain location, but it's not a flagship -- we don't build flagship from a branding standpoint that are losing money. So we look for the same profitability. We just build larger format when we want to show a broader assortment of the product where we've got much better or much stronger traffic. So it's not so much a flagship. It's a question of really having the right assortment where we need it and provide the global assortment with digital air cover. So you'll see larger format where it makes sense, but you won't see us build flagship as marketing or branding exercises. Chris Tham : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We'll talk again soon. Stuart Haselden : Thanks. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, SVP, Finance. Please go ahead. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to lululemon's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; and Stuart Haselden, CFO; along with Celeste Burgoyne, our SVP of the Americas, who will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started today, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to share with you today the results of a successful first quarter. I will start by offering a few highlights of the quarter, and I will then provide insights on our continued progress towards our 5-year plan, including each of the 4 growth strategies that were outlined on our last call. Stuart will then provide details on financials and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. We experienced continued momentum in Q1 that was the result of comp sales increases and gross margin improvements that exceeded our projections. Most relevant, we saw inventory levels get in line with our sales trend while exceeding gross margin expectations. We delivered Q1 revenues of $496 million, gross margin over 48% and adjusted EPS up $0.30, which included $0.06 of net FX pressure, primarily due to significant FX revaluation losses that we incurred as a result of the strengthening Canadian dollar in Q1, which Stuart will expand upon. While we are pleased to see the gross margin recovery in Q1 exceed what we had planned for, the continued recovery we are experiencing into the early weeks of Q2 is a validation of our team's work across our entire supply chain from design to in-store delivery. Our foundational work over the last year is paying off, and the earnings recovery we have planned for 2016 is taking shape. Likewise, with inventories now back in line, we have removed this strain on the business and are positioned to bring our innovation platform and our design vision to life powerfully, both in stores and online.  While store traffic comp wasn't as strong in Q1 as in Q4, we delivered a total revenue increase on a constant currency basis of 19%, driven by an 8% combined comp, the result of continued positive comps in our stores and e-commerce growth in the high teens. Given the retail macro environment, driving traffic has been a focus and continues to be one. The aligned product launch is a great example of the inherent success in combining innovation, storytelling, education and visual merchandising across channels. This launch drove traffic while enhancing brand engagement and margin. You will see more holistic product launches in the months to come as we deliver new styles and innovative fabrics across categories and genders.  Looking broadly across our business, we saw solid performance in key product categories as well as continued momentum across channels and geographies. We posted a 21% increase in our men's category, the sixth consecutive quarter of growth above 15%, and we posted another double-digit comp in women's bottoms as the success of our innovation continues to delight our guests around the world.  By channel, our stores delivered another strong positive comp, marking 4 consecutive quarters of positive comps. In Canada, where we have the most brand awareness, our guest loyalty was a catalyst in delivering a particularly strong trend. As a result, we posted a higher store comp than our U.S. store, which clearly made our Canadian team incredibly proud. Globally, online sales increased 18% in Q1 on top of a 31% increase in the first quarter of last year, a penetration of nearly 20% of the total business. These results put us on track to achieve our long-term vision. Operational excellence and building a sustainable high-performance culture have been a strategic focus for the past couple of years. I couldn't be more thrilled with the results we're seeing across all functions at lululemon. Specifically, and as it relates to supply chain, I am proud of the team's accomplishment in building a scalable foundation as we grow into a global, iconic brand. There is still work to do, and yet our accomplishments are reflected in the improved gross margin performance. On our Q4 call, we outlined 4 key growth strategies for 2016 and the next 5 years that will deliver revenue growth that doubles our 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] sales and earnings growth that will more than double during the same period. Q1 marks solid progress against these goals, which I will touch on specifically now. As a reminder, these 4 strategies were product innovation across current and new categories, reaching our full North American potential, building and leveraging a digital culture and building our global footprint through international expansion.  First, and with product innovation. We see tremendous guest response when we lead with innovation and articulate a unique functional point of view. We deliver our best work by never compromising and solving problems for athletes and yogis while being focused on craftsmanship and design. Our ambassadors are our local heroes and a unique source of inspiration. These individuals reflect our culture, share our core values, test our product to their limits, provide us with invaluable feedback and inspire us to create the best product for athletes and yogis. We recently hosted our annual Ambassador Summit in Whistler with 100 ambassadors from 9 countries around the world. Our collaboration with these athletes will continue to drive future innovations throughout 2016 and beyond. I recently had a chance to review the first prototypes of the winter 2016 season, and I'm really looking forward to our guests experiencing the powerful combination of function and fashion that Lee Holman, Tom Waller and the team are about to deliver. In July, we will cheer our athletes on their journey to Rio. On July 20, in Toronto, we will officially unveil the 2016 Canadian beach volleyball team equipment that all beach volleyball players representing Canada will wear while competing at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio. This summer will mark the first Olympic Games where lululemon has partnered with Canada's beach volleyball team to create one-of-a-kind equipment designed specifically for them. The custom gear was developed with real-time feedback from the athletes of the Canadian women's and men's beach volleyball team. Rigorous tests in on-court and in-house at lululemon's whitespace resulted in the ultimate designs that will allow the athletes to perform at their best, without distraction, while looking fantastic. As it relates to Q1, we saw improvement in the women's tops category, which comps positively and continues to gain momentum. A standout in the quarter was our Swiftly franchise. The performance of the Swiftly was bolstered by the introduction of True Black, a fabric and yarn innovation that achieves a unique depth of color. We also extended our bra assortment, giving our guests more option, both from a support and design standpoint.  And last but not least, our Fast Turn team, which is set up to bring product to life on shorter lead times, continues to be an important part of our strategy. A perfect example of the agility Fast Turn affords us is the success we saw in our Making Moves collection. In men's, we continue to see strong performance in our core franchises with new silhouettes in our seamless program and continued strength in our pants category driving strong comp. And with [indiscernible] across men's and women, we are focused on driving the men's sweat category and bringing new fabric innovation and styles to markets throughout our assortments. This month, we're excited to introduce the ABC construction that was pioneered with the ABC pant into more men's style to keep our male guests distraction-free throughout the day.  Turning next to our second growth driver, reaching our full North American potential. In Q1, we opened 2 new lululemon stores, along with 6 new ivivva locations. This supported our total square footage growth in Q1 of 18%, keeping pace towards our 12% annual goal. We also saw strong performance from recent key store optimization projects, including our Prudential Center store in Boston, our Northbrook Court store just outside Chicago and our Chinook expansion in Calgary.  These optimizations represent an essential element of our realistic strategy to best meet guest demand. And as our e-commerce business accelerates, we continue to see potential to expand our physical presence through different formats in North America. And where we have opened new stores, we see a corresponding increase in e-commerce penetration, reflecting the importance of building guest-centric and channel-agnostic strategies. As we have mentioned on previous calls, technology continues to be a very successful way for our educators to connect our guests to our entire inventory pool.  Our third growth strategy is building our digital ecosystem to deliver enhanced experiences anytime, anywhere and however our guests want to engage with lululemon. If you haven't already, I encourage all of you to visit our new environment at lululemon.com, which launched last month. The site now allows us to share richer community and product content with deeper storytelling that connects product design to our ambassadors and our local community. The site also features a streamlined checkout process to provide a better purchase experience. And our shop app now provides a functionality to see store product availability; therefore, giving our guests the option to get instant gratification by picking a product at their local store. Being able to turn on this incredible functionality is the result of leveraging our RFID technology, which gives us inventory accuracy at the store level above 98%.  In the second half of the year, we will fully roll out our CRM capabilities. We're moving quickly to test, implement and optimize our guest analytics engine and connect it with our digital marketing strategies. Finally, our fourth growth driver, our international expansion. We continue to make progress as we build vibrant communities in key cities across Europe and Asia. We opened our first street-front location in Asia and first store in Singapore situated in an iconic and historic sub-house on Duxton Road. This multilevel store includes a community space perfectly designed to host community classes and events. We also opened our first Japanese showroom, which I visited a couple of weeks ago, located in Tokyo's Harajuku district and on the corner of Omotesando and Cat Street. At about 900 square feet, this showroom is already one of our strongest performing showrooms, validating our go-to-market strategy and the potential of the Japanese market.  At the beginning of May, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea. I had the opportunity to attend the store opening and was inspired by the energy of the community as well as our entire team from our educators to our ambassadors.  And our IFC location in Hong Kong remains a highlight, producing about $5,000 in sales per square foot. While our Tmall presence is growing very rapidly building brand awareness across China, our disciplined and thoughtful approach to market entry and brand awareness building remains a very powerful strategy to ensure we create authentic and long-lasting relationship with our communities as we continue to expand our global collective. In Europe, we are pleased with the progress we made in the quarter and have some exciting developments on the horizon. We will open our first store in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland in July after great success with our showroom there over the past year. In the summer, we will be opening our first shop-in-shop in one of the world's premier shopping destinations in London. This location will allow us to build brand awareness and give our educators the opportunity to build the collective in a different environment. Other brand-building opportunities are underway in London that we look forward to sharing with you on subsequent calls. This is still just the beginning of our journey in Europe, and we are focused on winning in London. To support our growth strategies, our brand and community team continues to create brand resonance around the world. Last week, we launched our Summer of Yoga tour in the U.S. We'll cover 7,500 miles of open road in 45 days, stopping at a dozen locations across the U.S. as well as select Wanderlust festivals. Each stop will include a yoga and meditation experience led by one of our ambassadors as well as a pop-up shop, featuring this year exclusive Wanderlust products.  And here in Vancouver, we are gearing up for the event of the year, the fifth annual SeaWheeze Half Marathon, happening Saturday, August 13. SeaWheeze clearly isn't your average half marathon. Heralded by SELF magazine as one of the best running races to sign up for in 2016, it is 13.1 miles of breathtaking scenery, salty ocean air and over 10,000 runners. This year's race sold out in 30 minutes. So if you're not running, there is always a Sunset Festival, an evening of yoga, music, dancing, food and of course, beer. When it comes to the people at lululemon, what has always been exceptional is only getting better. Our educator installment as a turnover is at its lowest level ever in the brand's history, which is a testament to the commitment and investment we make in our people's development. Our leadership team is the strongest lululemon has ever assembled. It is global, diverse and a combination of people with tenure, combined with new additions to the team. Together, they provide the organization with deep experience and knowledge in design and innovation, vertical retail, digital as well as a real focus on culture, talent and operational excellence. Last but not least, we have welcomed 2 great new additions to our board this year, and both are bringing talent, insight and energy to our discussion. Kathryn Henry joins us with over 20 years of strategic IT and retail experience and is a longtime friend of lululemon, having previously served as Chief Information Officer. And Jon McNeill joined us in April and is President of Global Sales, Delivery and Service for Tesla Motors. He's one of the most respected leaders in America today, whose success as an entrepreneur has earned him a reputation as both an innovator and operational leader. Today, we have the right people throughout lululemon to support the execution of our strategic 5-year plan and invent future beyond 2020. In conclusion, Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Our performance was driven by our unique business model, encompassing product innovation, engaging guest experiences and a passion for the communities we live in. As we look to the rest of 2016 and beyond, I am inspired by the progress we're making, in particular, the return to earnings growth, driven by gross margin expansion that we see taking shape in Q2. I am proud of our teams who have been relentlessly building the capabilities and infrastructure that will drive and sustain our long-term growth and profitability. Celeste Burgoyne, our SVP of the Americas, is joining us this morning and is available to answer your questions later during the Q&A session. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Stuart, who will review our financial results for the first quarter and provide guidance on the full fiscal year. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our first quarter results. I'll then review our current outlook for the full year 2016 and also the second quarter. But starting with Q1. We saw a period of continued top line momentum within the context of a challenging retail environment. We delivered accelerated progress in recovering our gross margins and completed our work to rebalance our inventory levels in an orderly and disciplined manner. And when considering the impact of FX on our results in the quarter, we're pleased with the underlying recovery in earnings that Q1 represents, which we now see extending into Q2. Looking more closely at the details of the first quarter, total net revenue rose 17% to $495.5 million, with the increase in revenue driven by several factors. First, a total constant dollar comparable sales growth of 8% comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 5% and e-commerce comp of 18%. Secondly, an increase in square footage of 18% versus last year, driven by the addition of 57 net new company-operated stores since Q1 of 2015. 26 net new stores in the United States, 1 store in Canada, 1 in Australia, 5 in Europe, 4 in Asia and 20 ivivva stores. And finally, these factors were offset by the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $7.3 million or 1.5%. During the first quarter, we opened 10 net new company-operated stores, 2 in the U.S., 1 in Asia, 1 in Australia and 6 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 373 total stores versus 316 a year ago. There are now 290 stores in our comp base, 41 of those in Canada, 191 in the United States, 29 in Australia and New Zealand, 2 in Europe, 1 in Asia and 26 ivivva.  At the end of Q1, we also had a total of 71 showrooms in operation. 25 lululemon showrooms in North America, 20 internationally, along with 26 ivivva showrooms. Revenues from company-operated stores totaled $358.7 million or 72.4% of total revenue compared to $314.1 million in the first quarter of 2015 or 74.2% of total revenue. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $97.6 million or 19.7% of total revenue compared to 19.7% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year.  Other revenue, which includes outlets, showrooms, strategic sales, pop-up stores and warehouse sales, totaled $39.2 million versus $25.8 million in the first quarter of last year. This increase in other revenue relates primarily to the addition of 7 outlet stores since Q1 2015 in order to ensure appropriate liquidation capacity for our growing full-price business. It's also worth noting that our outlet store volumes are not included in the store comp calculation. Gross profit for the first quarter was $239.1 million or 48.3% of net revenue compared to $205.9 million or 48.6% of net revenue in Q1 2015. We're pleased with this progress against our gross margin goals. The factors that contributed to this outcome were 40 basis points of overall product margin improvement, primarily driven by lower FOB costs, reductions in raw material liability expenses and lower airfreight, offset with higher markdowns compared to Q1 2015 as part of our final steps to complete the rebalancing of our inventories.  Offsetting this improvement in product margin was 50 basis points of decline due to the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. And lastly, 20 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation. SG&A expenses were $181.5 million or 36.6% of net revenue compared with $137.8 million or 32.5% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A in the quarter was burdened by the impact of the significant strengthening in the Canadian dollar. This impact was higher than our expectations when we gave guidance due primarily to additional FX revaluation losses that we incurred in the second half of the quarter. Keep in mind that the Canadian dollar appreciated from $0.75 versus the U.S. dollar at the time of our last earnings call to just under $0.80 by the end of Q1. The resulting revaluation of the U.S. dollar balances accumulated in our Canadian entity significantly increased the FX losses reported in SG&A. Specifically, we incurred $13.5 million in revaluation losses in the quarter, which are reflected in total SG&A. This represented a $9.1 million increase over Q1 last year. Setting that aside, the remainder of the SG&A deleverage was due to consulting costs tied to our gross margin and supply chain initiatives, which are winding down now in Q2 as well as increased digital marketing efforts to drive traffic to our stores and then website and higher corporate support center overhead, which included $1 million of severance incurred in the quarter. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $57.6 million or 11.6% of net revenue compared with $68 million or 16.1% of net revenue in Q1 2015.  Tax expense for the quarter was $11.8 million or 20.6% of pretax earnings compared to 30.3% a year ago. The decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to a $5.6 million tax recovery, which we recognized in Q1 2016. This is connected to the company's transfer pricing arrangements and estimated taxes related to the associated plan to repatriate foreign earnings. Net income for the quarter was $45.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to net income of $47.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the tax and related interest adjustments, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.30. Importantly, the negative net impact to earnings from foreign currency this quarter was $0.06 per share versus the prior year, reflecting the significant strengthening in the Canadian dollar in the quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 137.5 million versus 142.3 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 240,000 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $65.01 per share. By the end of the quarter, we had completed a total of $437.2 million in total share repurchases, with the remainder of our $450 million total authorization now having been completed in early Q2. Capital expenditures were $26.6 million for the quarter compared to $27.9 million in the first quarter of last year.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $550 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $286.2 million or 21% higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a 3% decrease in inventory per square foot. This result reflects the substantial work begun a year ago in response to the supply chain disruptions we experienced in the first half of last year. We are pleased with how our teams across the company, from sourcing and logistics to stores and digital, were able to unwind this excess inventory position, while maintaining the integrity of our pricing and minimizing the impact on margins. We were also pleased to see that our preliminary inventory position at the end of May indicated an increase in the high single-digit range versus last year. We now expect our inventory growth at the end of Q2 and for the balance of the year to sit beneath our forward sales trend.  Turning now to the details of our Q2 and fiscal year 2016 updated outlook. We expect revenues in Q2 to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2015 and assumes a Canadian dollar at $0.77 to the U.S. dollar. This also assumes 8 new store openings in the quarter. Q2 marks a key growth margin inflection point for the company, as we have discussed for some time now. Our supply chain initiatives have made significant progress, and our margin goals remain on track. So for the second quarter, we now anticipate gross margin to increase approximately 120 basis points, over Q2 of last year. Consistent with what we have previously outlined, the increase is attributable to the following : higher product margins through improvements in key areas, including reductions in FOB costs, lower airfreight and reductions in raw materials liability costs through better controls and process changes. These will be offset by modest occupancy and depreciation deleverage. And based on the prevailing rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a nominal impact to gross margin in Q2.  We expect SG&A in the second quarter to delever significantly from Q2 2015, with roughly 1/3 of the impact attributable to lapping FX gains incurred in Q2 last year and the balance associated with the cost of completing the supply chain and gross margin initiatives, incremental digital marketing, technology projects and also brand and community investments. Assuming a tax rate of 30.2% and 137.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share versus $0.34 a year ago. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.305 billion to $2.345 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open up to 40 company-operated stores, slightly lower than our prior estimates, due to timing shifts in selected openings. This includes 11 new stores internationally and 12 ivivva stores and represents a square footage increase of approximately 12%. We expect gross margin for the year to increase from 2015 beginning with a positive inflection, starting in Q2 that we just outlined and continuing as we head into the back half of the fiscal year, as we deliver the benefits from the cost improvements, duty and logistics opportunities and more disciplined supply chain processes that we have been working on now for several quarters. We expect deleverage in the full year SG&A versus 2015, driven by strategic investments in our supply chain, digital capabilities, CRM infrastructure, guest experience, brand and IT systems. We expect the greatest deleverage in the first half of the year, driven notably by the FX losses we incurred in Q1, with some modest level of deleverage now expected in the third and fourth quarters. We expect our fiscal year 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 or $2.05 to $2.15 normalized for the tax and related interest adjustments in Q1. This is based off of 137.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding and also assumes an effective tax rate, 28.9% or 30.2% on a normalized basis. We expect capital expenditures to range between $160 million and $165 million for the fiscal year 2016, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments. This is higher than our guidance when we last spoke with you in March, due to the purchase of a land parcel in Vancouver for general corporate purposes.  In closing, Q1 marks several key milestones for us : sustained top line momentum fueled by product innovation; margin recovery ahead of expectations that validates our supply chain efforts; and the rebalancing of our inventories to position us for disciplined growth this year and beyond. We're excited for the trends we're now seeing emerging in Q2, which keep us on track to deliver the margin recovery and earnings inflection we've been working towards now for some time. Much work remains in front of us, but we are encouraged by our success in Q1 and progress so far in Q2. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Tracy Kogan : It's Tracy filling in for Paul. I have 2 questions. First, on gross margins. So you beat your guidance for the last 2 quarters in a row. And I'm wondering if we should be thinking a little more optimistically about your gross margin goals for 2016 and 2017 relative to what you previously talked about. And then secondly, on SG&A, what changed in your guidance that you're now expecting deleverage in the second half? Maybe that's related to FX, I'm not sure. Stuart Haselden : Tracy, it's Stuart. Yes. So on the gross margin for the year or just the gross margin in general, I think we were happy with the results that we saw in Q1. Certainly, saw upside in things that we mentioned on the call, the FOB costs, the fabric liability and airfreight, all better than expected. And those were offset by the markdowns that we mentioned. We see that continuing into Q2. And we're pleased with the progress again, that we're making against our plans. At this point, we feel like the guidance that we've given properly reflects the order of magnitude of that recovery. Certainly, there's always potential to do better, but we feel like the guidance where we have positioned it is appropriate, given the risks and opportunities that we see in the supply chain and our margin plans. The other elements of gross margin, occupancy and depreciation. Occupancy and depreciation will remain a headwind, as we mentioned. Certainly, those costs are more fixed. And to the extent we exceed our revenue expectations, we'll deliver more leverage on those fixed cost elements of the gross margin. And certainly, the FX is a wild card at this point. For Q2, as we mentioned, we see it as a relatively nominal effect as we look year-over-year versus last year. But that can change as we saw in the first quarter as well. And then on your second question, with regard to SG&A deleverage in the second half, I think the -- it's really a function of just as we refine our outlook for the second half of the year, we are seeing some modest level of deleverage. And I would say that translates to less than 100 basis points in the second half. And it's really just a function of where we see the current estimates on the FX impact, the translation and revaluation as well as just the investments that we continue to make in our business. So we feel like that connects to a healthy operating margin recovery in the second half of the year. We expect to see earnings up in the second half, double digits. We expect to see a healthy recovery in our operating margins as well, as we're able to flow through the improvements in our gross margin, to a greater degree, in the second half of the year. So I hope that answered your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen. Oliver Chen : Stuart, the rebalancing of inventory is really impressive. So for second quarter, what should we assume in terms of maybe second quarter and back half in terms of markdowns relative to last year, given that it looked -- it sounds like the inventories are in really super shape. And Laurent, on that topic of women's tops, where are you in that within that innovation? What needs to happen next in terms of what we should look for, whether it be pricing or styling? And are there any changes ahead as you think through the back half in terms of how you're evolving the pant wall, whether it be products or visual merchandising? Because I know there is a lot of innovation focus in that area as a store as well. Stuart Haselden : Great. Thanks, Oliver. I'll address your first question. So we're very pleased with the inventory position that we're in and the work that the teams have completed, as I mentioned. We expect to see markdowns moderate into Q2 and the balance of the year, and that's reflected in the margin guidance that we've given. And we noted on the call, in the prepared remarks, that as of the end of May, our preliminary inventory results indicate that inventories are up in the high single-digit range in the end of May. And that just reflects the further moderation in that year-over-year inventory growth. And as we mentioned, we expect inventories to be up to a lesser degree versus our revenue increases. So I think, as you look at it on a 2-year basis, the inventory position is still -- it's still full. We have plenty of inventory to drive our revenue projections. We're pleased to see the year-over-year trend come back in line, or actually will be -- sit beneath our forward sales trends. So inventories are healthy. They're clean. They position us in a manner that enables the optimization of our assortments. We're not dealing with the prior inventory overhang and it should translate into a better experience for our guests as well. Laurent Potdevin : And Oliver, from a tops standpoint -- I mean, we're actually really pleased. I mean, I would say that we're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be. And if you've been in our stores, you've seen the assortment shifting in the right direction. I mean, some of that is really the result of the power of our Fast Turn group, which really works on shorter lead times. And you can see different silhouettes. I mean, the Making Move collection with the pleated tags is a great example of bringing something to market really quickly. The Swiftly franchise has done really well. But I would say, I would attribute the current success mostly to the new silhouette, the looser silhouette, the one that you can layer. And that combined with the success of our bras, the Make A Move Bra, the Rack Pack Bra, the Get Down Bra, has really put us in a strong position. So I just looked at the spring '17 product and last week at the winter '16 product, and I'm absolutely thrilled with the progress that we're making. It's very much -- you'll see function and fashion coming together in a way that you haven't seen in quite some time, if not ever. And it's really the result of the product reorg that we've done and a number of talent that we added to the team from a design standpoint. So that combined with the progress that we've made in supply chain and being able to throw the product to bring the design intent to life the way we want to, it feels really powerful and it's actually showing up on the floor right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I think this is the first quarter in a while where your e-com hasn't kind of grown as a percent of sales. And I know it's chasing a moving target. But just curious as to what you think is going on in that channel, if you expect it to outpace the bricks-and-mortar for the full year. Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Stuart Haselden : Sharon, it's Stuart. So yes, the e-com growth, still double digits, high teens. We're not going to feel bad about that. It is a little lower than what we've seen last year. We feel like the penetration has the potential to grow well above 20%, easily could reach 25% to 30%. I think we talked about that in our 5-year goals. I would expect, as the digital team is able to ramp up the full impact of our new website, as we're able to bring online, particularly in the second half of the year, the full capabilities of our CRM efforts, we're going to see healthy trends in that e-com sales trend and would expect penetrations to increase over time. And so we're not seeing any red flags per se in the Q1 results. Laurent Potdevin : And remember that we are really focused on building guest-centric and channel-agnostic strategies. So the launch of the new website is actually a great example and a great foundation for what's to come. And we had -- with every website launch, we have anticipated a slight degradation in business as guests get used to the new user experience. And actually what we've seen is better conversion, especially on mobile and a very rapid adoption to the website. So we feel very good that as we launch the full analytics capabilities of our CRM and we tie that to our digital marketing strategy, we've got -- we're actually going to leapfrog from where we've been. So I'm very excited for what's to come there. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : On SG&A, can you just talk about investments that are embedded this year versus 2017? I guess the question being, does deleverage stabilize or potentially even turn to leverage next year as mid-single-digit comps were to persist? And then just secondly on international. Just the best way to think about the time line for international profitability. Stuart Haselden : Sure, Matt. It's Stuart. On the SG&A question, yes. I think we're going to get past the major supply chain investments really in Q2. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll begin to lap those investments in the prior year period. So it will be -- it will create some tailwind from an SG&A standpoint. That's embedded in the guidance that we've given. I think that then we have that in a more pronounced way as we get into '17 and beyond, as the -- we don't have these lumpy supply chain project pressure in the SG&A. So that element of it will certainly moderate even in the second half of the year and certainly into '17. We're always going to have things we're investing in. We're going to -- we're not in a place where we're squeezing SG&A to drive earnings. This is still a growth story. It's about revenue growth. It's about margin expansion. Those are the underpinnings of how we will recover a stronger earnings trajectory. We're going to invest in SG&A where it makes sense. But that said, we expect it will moderate even into the second half. Laurent Potdevin : And from an international standpoint, I mean, we continue to be really pleased with the strategy of entering key cities in key markets. So when you look at our performance in Asia, I mean, we've got all of our stores over $1,500 or $1,600 a square foot, with IFC in Hong Kong topping the list at $5,700 a square foot. So very happy with that. The Tmall penetration that we're seeing there is really putting a lot more eyeballs on the brand where we don't have a physical presence. Europe, in Europe, we're very focused on London. The retail environment in London has been a little tricky lately until they go through the election at the end of June. And what we've seen is in the market where we've got a great community, we're doing really well, including King's Road, Covent Garden and Marylebone. And in a couple of cities where we're probably gotten a little bit ahead of the vibrancy of the community, we're not seeing the same result, and that would be Danburg [ph] and Richmond. So it's actually a great sort of validation that focusing on the key markets and going where we have the community pays off. And I would actually love to add that in our remarks we have hinted at the fact that we're going to find a couple of different ways of going to market in London that will definitely drive brand awareness in a really powerful way, and we're very excited to share that with you probably in the next couple of weeks. Matthew Boss : And if I could just sneak one more in. Given some of the larger picture shopping mall trends, what kind of traffic and comp trends have you seen so far in 2Q just versus the first quarter and the mid-single-digit guidance? Stuart Haselden : So Matt, I'll give you a little color. I might invite Celeste to comment as well. The traffic was softer in the first quarter versus what we saw in Q4. And it was softer late in the quarter as well, and that persisted into the first couple of weeks of May in Q2. We have seen the traffic trends improve in the last couple of weeks. So there's been a mixed trend in the -- in terms of traffic in the first part of Q2. AUR and conversion have offset that to help us deliver the comps that we reported in Q2 -- Q1, we guided to in Q2. But may -- I'll ask Celeste to add some color. Celeste Burgoyne : Yes, Stuart. I think you hit it. I mean, basically we did see Q1 traffic not being as strong as we saw in Q4. However, when we look at the highly negative macro trend, we feel really good that we were favorable to that. AUR and conversion gives us really good indication that our new product drops are resonating with our guests as well as our continued focus on a great guest experience, both online and in stores, is continuing to pay off. So as we look into Q2, we continue to see the momentum in AUR and conversion maintained. So it definitely -- it gives us confidence as we shift into Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Oppenheimer. Anna Andreeva : I was curious if you could talk about the monthly comp progression in 1Q. Should we think April was the weakest month of the quarter, given the traffic comments that you made? And sorry if we missed this. What were comps by division in 1Q, Canada versus U.S. and Australia? And secondly, I guess to Laurent, just holistically, thinking through the pricing architecture for LULU, I think we are starting to see some of the opening price points in tops specifically. Is that an opportunity to extend the customer reach for the brand? And any tweaks you guys need to make to pricing architecture in bottoms, especially? Stuart Haselden : Anna, so that was a mouthful. So on the comp question and traffic, the -- we're not going to break out the comps by month. I think, as Celeste said, we saw -- we are very encouraged by the strength in AUR and conversion. Traffic, as I mentioned, was weaker in the second half of Q1, and that persisted into the early weeks of May before becoming stronger in the last few weeks. So that's embedded, again, in the results that we reported in Q1 and then in the guidance. By region, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we saw strength in Canada, in particular. And Canada actually posted a store comp that was slightly higher than the U.S., which, again, we look at that as a strong indicator of the -- just the strength of the brand and how -- in our most mature market, we're driving some of our strongest results. And again, it speaks to our assortments and our in-store execution. So -- and then on the -- on your question regarding pricing... Laurent Potdevin : Think about pricing, Anna, on the bottom side. I mean, we're very happy with the pricing architecture. I mean, as I was mentioning in looking at winter '16, spring '17, we're delivering a lot of innovation. And so we price with the value that we deliver to the guests. I mean, we are very confident that we've got, with the pricing architecture, both across categories within the global standpoint as well. And with tops, I mean, we're like where we need to be. I mean, we see a lot of success, and we see the opportunity to actually bring innovation and continue to be sort of really honing the [indiscernible] of the market the way we always have. Operator : Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Stuart, I just wanted to ask -- I think you said $0.06 in the quarter due to FX hits. Can you just remind us how many pennies of FX headwind you had planned for in the quarter? And then, Laurent, as we look into the back half of the year and reflect on the very successful pant launch that you guys had in the third quarter last year, can you talk about your product strategies and how you're thinking about driving your business to the next level as we proceed through the year? Stuart Haselden : Kimberly, it's Stuart. So the EPS impact from FX certainly exceeded our expectations. We did expect deleverage in the quarter. You might recall that we had mentioned that in our guidance back in March. And we had, at that point, even seeing the Canadian dollar strengthen significantly from around $0.70 at the end of Q4 to $0.75 at the time of the call. Safe to say that the actual result exceeded our expectations in terms of the level of pressure that we saw from FX. Canadian dollar, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, strengthened $0.05 from $0.75 to $0.80 in the last 4 weeks of Q1. We did not expect that. And so I think we had an estimate of around $0.03 in the prior outlook that we had. So where it landed was almost double our expectations. And so the -- it's something that is really part of the exposure that we have from our -- the cash balances that we accumulate in Canada in U.S. dollars. It's not really the translation of the Canadian P&L per se. And I would add that we've taken steps already to -- from an operational standpoint to reduce our exposures in those cash balances. And at this point, our exposure is less than half of what it was in Q1. So we feel like we're going to be able to mitigate this exposure to some degree as we go forward. But certainly, it's something we will continue to be focused on. Laurent Potdevin : And on your product question, Kimberly, I think that the pant launch was successful and was really the very beginning of what we're about to do. I mean, when you see summer land, you'll see a completely different assortment. I mean, that being sort of collapsed the studio and the car deal [ph], pods and making them one group -- I mean, you're going to see a hard wall, you're going to see the ability to put outfits together across the entire assortment. It's going to be a lot more powerful. You're going to see a lot more newness in fabrics, textures and print, but also a very elevated attention to details to trim, construction, raw materials in a way that probably hasn't come to life in the past couple of years. So obviously -- and we'll continue to focus on run where we see a tremendous opportunity both for men's and women's. And you'll see most of the focus if not all of the focus on the sweat category, which we really own and want to continue to lead. So as it is summer -- I mean, you'll see an environment that is elevated, that speaks to function and that looks fantastic. Chris Tham : Thank you, everyone for joining us today. We'll talk again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, Senior Vice President, Finance for lululemon. Please go ahead. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; and Stuart Haselden, CFO.  Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.  Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.  Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour.  [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a strong quarter with revenue of $515 million, earnings up $0.38 per share and most importantly, the return to earnings growth we had predicted. The level of execution across our 4 key strategies : product innovation, building a digital ecosystem, North American growth and international expansion, combined with our focus on operational excellence, drove our continued performance. What pleases me most, with regards to our performance, is the quality of our results, which were driven by the ongoing top line momentum, as our investments in innovation continued to drive the business. Our SG&A came in a bit higher, in part due to accelerating some investments, which Stuart will speak to later.  Gross margin improvement accelerated substantially and the inflection in product margins we've been building towards exceeded expectations as we posted a 260 basis point increase over last year. This is the result of the initiative that started a couple of years ago to build a scalable supply-chain and create a world-class sourcing structure to support our global expansion plan. I could not be more proud of the team's accomplishments in delivering this return to earnings growth. We are planning for this growth to accelerate into the second half of this year and beyond.  Reflecting on our global opportunity. We are leading and supporting one of the most significant movements taking place, a continued trend towards a more active and mindful lifestyle. At the same time, retail is evolving at an increasingly rapid pace. We're observing a shift in the way consumers engage with brands, how they connect with each other, and how they value focus-driven brands. Each choice is increasingly built around experiences rather than transactions. This evolution creates a tremendous opportunity for lululemon. Our highly productive physical footprint, augmented by our digital capabilities, combined with a deep understanding of the communities we're active in, gives us the unique advantage and flexibility to adapt quickly to consumer behavior. Despite a challenging macro environment, our educator, our products and our focus on operational excellence have driven another healthy mid-single-digit  comp in the second quarter. We saw continued performance in our store as well as an e-commerce comp of 16% after normalizing for the online warehouse sales that occurred last year. Looking more broadly at results across all categories in Q2, we saw our design vision powerfully come to life and resonate with our guests. Within the women's category, guest embraced unique design details, such as mesh, braiding, bonding and engineered prints. Our Minimalist collection, designed for studio, and our Goal Crusher collection, designed for high sweat and run, incorporated some of these details and are a favorite with our guests. Our tops assortment continues to evolve, and we saw sequential improvement in our bra and tank categories, up 13% and 3%, respectively, year-over-year, driven by a powerful color assortment and growth in shirtless tanks. The combination of function and fashion is beautifully expressed through prints, patterns [ph] and textures, with the deutrider [ph] print that launched in July being a perfect illustration of this combination. Other future product highlights included continued strength in men with midteens comp, driven by new product and continued strong performance in iconic styles, such as the ABC pants and Metal Vent seamless tops. Finally, our focus on operational excellence is the main driver of gross margin and earnings improvement. Benefits from sourcing, logistics and more disciplined supply chain processes drove these results. Next, let me detail the  progress we've made across of the 4 strategies that are driving our long-term goals. First with product innovation. I am truly inspired by the continued evolution of the product assortment as it comes to life. Our return to being a design-led organization is coming through clearly, with an overarching vision translating across categories and genders.  Nowhere was that better exemplified than with the 2016 Olympics and our partnerships with the Canadian women's and men's beach volleyball team. Hanging out with the athletes in July at our Cumberland store in Toronto was such a thrill, second only to watching them wear our product in Rio last month. This collaboration demonstrates the unique asset relationships that are at the core of what we do and how we work. Within our women's tops category, our design focus has been in newer materials, fit, layering and outfitting. Within tanks specifically, you can expect to see more natural feel fabrics, lightweight layering option and the expansion of silhouette to complement our outfitting with more fitted bottoms. In the back half of this year, we will also introduce a new fleece aesthetic collection for men and women. Fabric innovation is front and center with the introduction of a new fabric within our bottoms assortment in September. Providing gentle compression and crafted to minimize disruptions, Nulu has it all. It offers quick drying, sweat-wicking and lightweight coverage. Nulu looks -- will make its debut with the like-nothing pants, and will also be available in core [ph] styles, including the wunder under and high times.  This is lululemon's first Naked Sensation cardio pants specifically developed for sweaty indoor workouts such as spin. As we continue to raise the bar on craftmanship, we're also dialing up the visual impact of print, utilizing highly technical processes that allow us to achieve a richer level of color and detail without sacrificing function. You can expect to see this new digitally-engineered print on the Nulu's fabric we're launching, and in a variety of different style, including the new speed tight. Later in the year, we will also introduce a gorgeous Black Friday collaboration with Janina Nilero [ph], also known as Feather Girl [ph], a textile designer from Paris who works regularly with couture houses.  We combined the artistry of her feather designs with technical silhouettes and fabrics to create digitally-engineered print. Our next area of focus is reaching our full potential in North America, where we continue to expand our footprint strategically while also exploring new formats. In May, we reopened our Mall of America store as a co-located men's and women's space, totaling 5,080 square feet. A dedicated and larger men's space provide for an unparalleled guest experience. And since the reopening, men's sales have increased 80% over last year to roughly 26% of total sale, while total sales are up 35%.  We recently renovated our summer fit collection store in Detroit, one of the highest volume stores in the country. The men's business there is also one of the strongest across our portfolio. It's tremendously satisfying to see our momentum in this market, which is home to 4 professional sports team. In a rapidly evolving landscape, we don't take a one-size-fits-all approach to store format. This year, you'll see us open the doors to new, smaller format store that we're calling, local. These innovative hyper-local community stores allow us to come to life in front of -- influence communities that we wouldn't otherwise reach, offering events and programmings that are relevant to the local community.  These locals will be anywhere between 1,000 to 2,000 square feet with similar productivity per square foot as our standard stores. The Fort Collins, Colorado local, which opened on August 20, is the first and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. More locals will follow in select markets across the U.S. and Canada. With smaller retail footprint, we are more innovative about the way we connect with and service our guest, and we are able to reach the full potential of the smaller store format with air cover from our digital environment. Digital is our next key strategic priority. And since the launch of our new site, we've been focused on continually enhancing the guest experience with schemes and technology that are agile and nimble. This improvement extends to payment security. At the most recent Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, we were excited to be among the first retailers to implement Apple Pay across web, mobile and stores. This will ensure secure payment authentication across our digital access points. Our investment in CRM is already informing and enhancing the way we communicate with our guest, both in store and online. With a robust database that now includes over half of our guests, we are developing a unified, multichannel view that allows us to analyze and understand guest behavior and create greater engagement. As an example, I'm excited about the ship-from-store  pilot.  Online orders can currently be fulfilled some available inventory in 11 location. This is yet another capability that further improves our ability to service our guest, optimize our inventory sell-through at full retail. Earlier results have been positive, and we are extending this to 65 stores for the upcoming holiday season. Last, but not least, we are expanding our collection globally. As I have shared, building new and vibrant communities in key Asian and European cities is essential to our 5-year plan. On our last call, I mentioned several development, which have since come to life. In August, we opened our first ever lululemon shop-in-shop concept at Harrods, one of the world's most iconic retailers. This venture brings lululemon within the walls of one of London's most famous destinations. Our team on the ground is excited to introduce the SWEATLIFE to the 14 million guests that visit the store each year. This past July in London, we had a one-day SWEATLIFE festival and dance party for 1,500 old and new friends. Our guests joined local and global yoga ambassadors, including Chris Chavez and Gloria Latham, and sweated with the best studios in London, finishing the day off in typical lululemon fashion with a dance party led by Grandmaster Flash.  On August 19, we opened our first Maven [ph] store in Europe, within the historic Spitalfield market, one of London's oldest and most iconic shopping districts. And in Q4, we will open an 8,200 square foot store on Regent Street. With 7.5 million annual visitors to this area, it is one of the best shopping streets in the world. This store will be a key part of our capital city strategy and building the brand in Europe. To celebrate the store opening, we are partnering with Central Saint Martins fashion students to create a limited edition collection that will be sold exclusively at the Regent Street store. Turning to Asia. Our existing stores continue to perform well, and we are seeding  key cities in new markets. In July, we celebrated the opening of our first showroom in Osaka, our second in Japan following Tokyo. Located in popular shinsaibash area, the showroom is a great space that houses its own studio where the community team can host daily activities and classes.  We continued to build momentum in Asia last month with Unroll China, a signature online to off-line community program in partnership with Alibaba. Registration for a series of iconic experience or events sold out overnight with guests attending the first ever yoga party in the Forbidden City with some of the world's most celebrated yoga teacher. Unroll China was a significant moment in building brand awareness for lululemon in Asia. Finally, we also have 2 additional store openings planned later this year. Following the successful opening of our first store in Seoul, Korea, which just opened our second store in Seoul, located at Parnas mall, the largest underground mall in Asia. And finally, we plan to open our first store in Beijing later this year, located in Sanlitun, a key shopping and entertainment destination. We've been seeding China with 3 high-performing showroom, community events, such as Unroll China, and our presence on Tmall, which collectively are building awareness for the brand. We're only getting started here, and this will be a significant part of the global growth story going forward. In summary, our accomplishments and successful result in Q2 are being driven by our relentless focus on function, innovation and design; our authentic connections with our growing collective, which includes our educators, guest and ambassador; the amazing guest experience that we deliver at every touch point in-store and digitally, always adapting to where the market is going; and lastly, our high performance culture and focus on operational excellence, which drove our return to earnings growth. We're very well positioned to deliver on our plan to double revenue and more than double earnings by 2020, and I could not be more proud of the way our entire team is working together to deliver this result. I want to close by thanking our educators, who interact with our guest every day, are the face of lululemon around the world and remain, in so many ways, the key to our success. With that, I will now turn the call over to Stuart, who will review our financial results for the second quarter and provide guidance on the full fiscal year. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. As you mentioned, I will offer additional details on the results of our second quarter, I'll then discuss our current outlook for the third quarter as well as the full year 2016. Q2 marks not only the achievement of critical performance milestones, but also represents an important turning point for lululemon. The product margin inflection in the quarter reflects the culmination of our ongoing efforts over the last 2 years and sets the stage for successive quarterly improvements as we restore the company's profitability. The rebalancing of our inventories removes the prior overhang on our assortments and positions us to optimize our product offerings. And finally, the double-digit earnings growth in Q2 reflects our improving flowthrough on a continued strong top line. And this is just the beginning. As our SG&A investments are now moderating into Q3 and beyond, we expect to see accelerating earnings growth and expanding operating margins. Turning now to the details of Q2.  Total net revenue rose 13.6% to $514.5 million or 14.7% on a constant currency basis. The increase in revenue was driven by several factors. First, a total constant-dollar comparable sales growth of 5%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 4% and an e-commerce comp of 7%. Keep in mind, we held an online warehouse sale last year in Q2 that accounted for $6.6 million in volume. Normalized for this event, our e-commerce comp would have been 10 comp points higher this quarter and consistent with our Q1 trend, and our overall comp would have been approximately 2 comp points higher.  Secondly, an increase in square footage of 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 43 net new company-operated stores since Q2 of 2015, 17 net new stores in the United States, 1 store in Canada, 1 in Australia, 4 in Europe, 3 in Asia and 17 ivivva stores. And finally, these factors were offset by the foreign currency exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which had the effect of decreasing reported revenues by $5.3 million or 1%. During the second quarter, we opened 6 net new company-operated stores, 1 in Canada, 1 in Asia, 1 in Europe and 3 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 379 total stores versus 336 a year ago. There are now 309 stores in our comp base, 42 of those in Canada, 201 in the United States, 28 in Australia and New Zealand, 3 in Europe, 3 in Asia and 32 ivivva.  At the end of Q2, we also had a total of 68 showrooms in operation : 25 lululemon showrooms in North America, 20 internationally, along with 23 ivivva showrooms. Revenues from company-operated stores totaled $381.4 million or 74.1% of total revenue, compared to $339.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 or 75% of total revenue. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $87.4 million or 17% of total revenue compared to 18.2% of total revenue in the second quarter of last year. Our e-commerce penetration increased by 10 basis points when normalized for the prior year online warehouse sale. Other revenue, which includes outlets, showrooms, strategic sales, franchises, pop-up stores and warehouse sales totaled $45.7 million versus $31 million in the second quarter of last year. This increase in other revenue relates primarily to new outlets and growth in existing outlets since the second quarter of 2015. We expect that growth rates in our other channel to normalize in the back half of this year as we anniversary these openings. Gross profit for the second quarter was $254.2 million or 49.4% of net revenue, compared to $212 million or 46.8% of net revenue in Q2 of 2015, an increase of 260 basis points. This marks the first quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement since Q1 of 2014. The factors that contributed to this outcome include 360 basis points of increased product margin. This was driven principally by lower overall product costs that increased merchandise margins and reductions in raw material liability expenses, along with lower markdowns compared to Q2 2015. These improvements resulted from our coordinated efforts across the supply chain. Offsetting this improvement in product margin were 20 basis points of decline due to the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, 40 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation and 40 basis points from investments in our design, merchandising and supply chain functions that are included in our cost of goods sold. SG&A expenses were $180.2 million or 35% of net revenue, compared to $145.4 million or 32.1% of net revenue for the same period last year. The 290 basis point increase in SG&A rate was driven by increases in Store and Support Centre employee costs, including annual incentive and stock-based compensation expenses; investments in our Store Support Centre overhead, which include our digital, IT, brand and retail operations functions; investments to drive top line, such as digital marketing, product campaigns and related brand marketing costs and a slight decrease in net foreign exchange gains compared to Q2 2015. The deleverage in the quarter was higher than initially expected primarily due to the acceleration of key investments in our merchandising operations, CRM capabilities and brand strategy. Specifically, these investments will enable us to sustain and extend the margin recovery that's now building and also accelerate efforts in customer analytics and brand marketing.  As a result, operating income for the quarter was $74 million or 14.4% of net revenue, compared with $66.6 million or 14.7% of net revenue in Q2 2015. Tax expense for the quarter was $20.9 million or 28.1% of pretax earnings compared to 29.3% a year ago. The decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to a $1.9 million reduction in tax expense, which we recognized in Q2 2016. Similar to last quarter, this is connected to the company's transfer pricing arrangements and estimated taxes related to the associated plan to repatriate foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for the second quarter, excluding the above tax adjustments and associated interest costs, was 30.5%. Net income for the quarter was $53.6 million or $0.39 per diluted share. This is compared to net income of $47.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the tax and related interest adjustments, the diluted earnings per share would have been $0.38. There was a nominal impact to earnings from foreign currency this quarter versus the prior year. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 137.2 million versus 141.6 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 201,000 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $63.65 per share. By the end of the quarter, we had completed a total of $450 million in total share repurchases with the total authorization now having been completed.  Capital expenditures were $44.6 million for the quarter compared to $37.2 million in the second quarter last year. This includes the purchase of a land parcel in Vancouver for corporate purposes for $19.7 million. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $535.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was $277.3 million or 1.2% lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2015, reflecting a 15% decrease in inventory per square foot. Our inventory levels and composition remained healthy, particularly when looking at the 2-year comparison. We are well-positioned from an inventory standpoint to achieve our back half sales expectations. We expect our inventory growth at the end of the third quarter to continue to sit beneath our forward sales trend as we anniversary our elevated inventory levels from last year. Turning now to the details of our Q3 and fiscal year 2016 updated outlook.  We expect revenues in Q3 to be in the range of $535 million to $545 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single-digits  on a constant dollar basis compared to the third quarter of 2015 and assumes a Canadian dollar at CAD 0.77 to the U.S. dollar. This also assumes 9 net new store openings in the quarter. We are pleased to see the gross margin inflection that began in Q2 now extending into the initial weeks of Q3, and we expect this recovery to continue taking shape through the second half of this year and beyond. For the third quarter specifically, we anticipate gross margin to increase in the range of 200 to 250 basis points over Q3 of last year. This increase is attributable to the following : higher product margins through lower overall product costs, which is the most significant component; duty, trade and logistics efficiencies and continued reductions in raw materials liability costs through our improved buying and sourcing processes. These will be offset by slight occupancy and depreciation deleverage and a modest deleverage in product and supply-chain SG&A. And based on the underlying foreign exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact to gross margin in Q3. We expect SG&A in the second half to delever, but to a much lesser degree than the first half. For Q3 and Q4 combined, we anticipate approximately 100 basis points of deleverage with Q3 slightly higher and Q4 slightly lower. This SG&A outlook reflects incremental spend associated with merchandising and brand strategic investments as well as digital and IT cost associated with our omni-channel strategies. Assuming a tax rate of 30.5% and 137.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44 per share versus normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.35 a year ago. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.325 billion to $2.350 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open up to 42 company operated stores, which include the local that Laurent talked about earlier, 11 new stores internationally and 12 ivivva stores and represents a square footage increase of approximately 12%. We expect gross margin for the year to increase from 2015, driven by the improvements delivered in Q2 and carrying forward for the remainder of the year. We expect deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2015, driven by the strategic investments that were mentioned earlier, principally in supply chain, brand, digital and IT systems, along with the net FX revaluation losses incurred so far this year. We expect our fiscal year 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.19 or $2.07 to $2.15 normalized for the tax and related interest adjustments incurred this year.  This is based off of 137.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. It also assumes an effective tax rate of 28.7% or 30.5% on a normalized basis. We expect capital expenditures to range between $165 million to $170 million for the fiscal year 2016, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments. In closing, we are heading into the second half of the year in a position of strength, continued top line momentum, fueled by product innovation and the underlying strength of our brand and guest experience. This, together with a much improved operational foundation that has now begun to deliver on the anticipated gross margin recovery, well-positions us for the accelerating earnings and the inflection in operating margin that we now see materializing.  With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. Kate Fitzsimons : This is Kate Fitzsimons on for Brian. I guess, first is on the gross margin. Stuart, can you just speak to your expectations for markdowns into the back half now that inventory is so lean? And then, secondly, I guess, just product costs in particular appear to be coming in much faster than we anticipated. You'd previously spoken to that 300 basis point merch margin opportunity. I guess, just how is what you're seeing from a product cost perspective making you maybe reevaluate that opportunity, more bullish, just how should we think about that there? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Kate. On the -- on your questions on gross margin, let me just cast some or offer some clarity rather on the results in the second quarter and how we were able to exceed our expectations and our prior guidance. So there were really 3 factors that enabled us to exceed expectations in the second quarter. First, it was a favorable selling mix. We sold a higher proportion of our products from the higher-margin categories. The second factor was less markdowns. To -- more to your point, we saw a higher full price sell-through result in the quarter. We had less markdowns that were needed in order to stay on top of our inventory movement. And the third factor was a favorable duty cost outcome. We saw better-than-expected savings from our first sale programs. Specifically on markdowns, as I mentioned, the results that we saw in the second quarter were better than expected. I would -- looking forward into the second half of the year, I wouldn't necessarily expect that, that same outcome would continue just given the healthy position that we have in our inventory now. So I would expect markdowns to normalize to some degree into the second half of the year and perhaps not be quite as favorable as we saw in the second quarter. In terms of the product costs benefits that we are achieving, we are in fact on track to achieve the order of magnitude of the 300 basis point improvement as we look back to 2014 levels over the next few quarters. And so that is -- that program to recover that level of profitability is materializing. We're pleased with the progress we're making. And by the -- I would say, by 2017, certainly, the middle of 2017, we will have achieved the majority of that cost or that product cost improvement. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on the SG&A front, can you just expand a little bit on the commentary regarding the moderating investments? And specifically, how should we think about the comp needed to leverage SG&A as we get into next year and into 2018? Stuart Haselden : Yes, I would say the SG&A takeaway from the guidance and the results we just announced is that we expect SG&A to moderate into the second half of the year and into 2017 as well. Over the long term, I would expect us to be able to leverage SG&A at a high single-digit comp level. So -- but in the near term, we've just completed a number of critical strategic investments in relation to the infrastructure of our supply chain and merchandising. The bulk of those activities are wrapping up in the second quarter, and that is what's giving rise to the moderation in SG&A into the second half and then further into 2017. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up. Can you speak to the cadence of comp you saw this quarter as we kind of move from the start to the finish? And then just what did you see in tops versus bottoms? And was performance in August versus your mid-single-digit  guide pretty consistent or anything to think about as we think about the progression from here? Stuart Haselden : So I'll speak to the comp progression and just the underlying drivers of the comp, and then maybe Laurent will speak to the product category performance. We did see traffic continue to be a headwind for us in the second quarter. We were able to offset that with improvements in AUR and UPTs that enabled us to deliver the positive comp that we reported. The traffic headwinds have extended into the third quarter, but similarly we're seeing upside in AUR and UPTs that are offsetting it. The trend has been choppy, and I think we're not immune to what's happening from a macro standpoint. We're not going to be able to break down the specific periods within the quarter, but the trends, we didn't see a huge divergence sort of beginning to end of the quarter, safe to say. Laurent Potdevin : I think that when you look at the product category, I mean, we continue to see a lot of strengths in the bottoms, women's bottoms. I mean, it's double-digit comping. And every time we've introduced new silhouettes, new functionalities, some of the details that came in the past couple of months and new fabrics, I mean, we see a fantastic response from our guests. So I really do feel that as we continue to -- we had the loss of the pant wall last year, and that was a moment in time where we introduced a couple of fabrics and a few silhouettes. And since then, we've been continuing to introduce silhouettes, if you think about the Align Pant or the Align Crop and every time we've done that, we've actually seen great response. And actually, where we've actually delivered more value to the guests and taken price increases, we've seen no price resistance. So really pleased with that. And the work that we're doing in tops is really starting to -- paying off, especially with tanks and bras. Operator : The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Laurent, I'm wondering if you can look into the back half of the year and talk to us about the product initiatives. I'm not sure if the tank wall full relaunch has yet been executed in the stores. And then how do you think about the opportunities and challenges as you begin to anniversary that women's pant wall relaunch from early September last year? Laurent Potdevin : I think -- I don't think we should think about necessarily anniversarying the pant wall. I mean, the pant wall was a new way of presenting the product assortment with fabrics and silhouette, but it was really sort of a matter of starting to educate on sensation. And so I would really think about, for every product category, but specifically with pant, as a continued flow of innovation. So you're going to see,  we're going to introduce new looks with new fabric in September. And so you're going to see, the way we educate on sensation, you're going to see that continue. But within that education, you're going to see new fabric, new silhouette. So I feel like we've got the right pipeline of innovation, both from a fabric, a silhouette and as well from a print and texture standpoint, we've got the right pipeline of innovation to continue to perform in the category. So I feel really good about that. When I think about the back half of the year, what I'm really excited about is if you think about the first half, what we've done from a digital standpoint, we really put a great foundation in place. So we launched a website. For the first few weeks of the launch, I mean, we actually did better than we expected as user get a new user experience. But we invested less in digital marketing as users got familiar with the environment. And in the second half, I mean, now we've got CRM fully implemented. We've got capabilities to do A/B testing on everything we do. And we're going to see continual improvement with -- if you think about the whole experience, we are really relentlessly focused on reducing all the frictions with our guests. So from the way you're browsing to the way you're looking at the product pages, to the check-out, you're going to see a lot of improvements. So the foundation was put in place in Q1. We were able to achieve some great performance. And now we can really accelerate with tools that we're putting on top of that foundation. So I'm really excited about not only the impact that it will have online, but I mean, we benefit greatly from that work in stores as well. And so when you think about ship-from-store program or the continued success of our BBR apps that access online inventory in the stores, I mean, all of that coming together, I'm really, really excited about that. Operator : The next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : On the topic on the online business and what's happening there, what would you isolate as the biggest year-over-year changes we should look to as we look to the back half? I'm just curious about thinking about inventory management across both online and offline and what opportunities you have there. And as you did elaborate on CRM, is that going to help traffic both online and in stores, like what's the linkage between CRM and the big opportunity to drive revenues? Laurent Potdevin : I wish we had more time to answer that question because there is so much going on in the back half. But I mean, if you look at -- simply look at what happened with the mobile app. Like since we relaunched the website, I mean, we went from a 2.5, 3 star rating in the app store to a 4.6 star rating, which really speaks to the new user experience. So you had a couple of questions. I mean, if you think about CRM and analytics, I mean, one, the ability to test everything we're doing is something that we didn't have and something that's paying off instantly. So we can put different product pages up and know within hours what works, what doesn't work or what works better. From a men's standpoint, I mean, lately, we've been able to send like a men's personalized homepage to the guest that we know, and that had over a couple of weeks an improvement of 7.5% in conversion for that segment, which was fantastic. I mean, if you think about in-store reengagement with sharing all of that CRM data so that the store can actually create events that are catered to very qualified guests. And we can actually switch from a weekly e-mail that was really product-based to opportunities that are more event-based. So maybe you're a lapsed guest and we're getting you back or maybe you're a first time guest and we can really talk to you in a more personalized way, and all of that's coming to life in the back half of the year. So to your question, it's -- you're going to see continually and it's very agile and nimble, the environment that we build with the team that we have. So you're going to seek continual change through the entire experience and it will benefit the stores as well. And we're linking inventory. So when you think about ship from store, I mean, it's really going to allow us to use potential like broken sites curve to move them much faster at full retail. So avoiding those onesies and twosies markdown in the stores, then we'll have access to those items much faster. So there's a lot going on in the back end of the year that will bring the entire ecosystem together. Oliver Chen : And Laurent, the shop in shop at Harrods sounds awesome. And I know there's so much demand for both the brand and really wholesalers just kind of replicating a lot of what you do. What's your long-term vision for how wholesale should play a role as you think about your global strategy and as you grow your business and think about speed and awareness versus direct to consumer from lulu? Because there are potentially a lot of great brand partners out there, but there's pros and cons to using the wholesale channel? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, I mean, I think it -- well, first of all, when you mention a wholesale, I mean, I think it's really important for people to know that at Harrods, I mean, it is our employees and our inventories. So what we're known for is the experience, I mean, we actually create and control that experience, which is really, really important. I mean, I've said before, I mean, it's -- the structure that we have being vertical, really allows us to not only create amazing experience but also gives us the margin structure to work with the best fabrics and the best textures.  And what you're going to see in the second half some incredible prints. So I think you're right. There are opportunities around the world to evolve the model. Harrods is one of them. What we're doing in China with Tmall is -- Tmall is growing incredibly fast in China, and it's putting a lot of eyeballs on the brand. So we've got opportunity strategically to work with partners. And I certainly wouldn't say that it's going to a wholesale model. I mean, we're very happy with the structure that we have and the extent [ph] that it allows us to create for our guests. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : Just curious. Where is the tops business right now relative to where you want it to be? And assuming that we're not all the way there, at what point can we expect to see the majority of that improvement complete? And then, second, I just want to clarify something. Stuart, I thought on the last call, you had mentioned that May maybe started off a bit slow. So I just wanted to clarify if, in fact, the monthly performance was actually consistent across the quarter or if May was the weaker month and you finished stronger. Stuart Haselden : Paul, it's Stuart. I'll ask that -- I'll answer that question on the comp first. So the -- we did see the quarter start out slow from a traffic standpoint. We did not really see a meaningful improvement in the traffic trend throughout the quarter. So that remained a headwind for us for the second quarter. As I mentioned, there are other KPIs, specifically AUR and UPTs that were able to have help offset that. As we drill closer into AUR, it's a combination of favorable mix as well as price. So that trend has largely extended into the first few weeks of Q3 in terms of those store KPIs. And then on tops? Laurent Potdevin : And as far as the tops business, I mean, I think you're going to see improvement. I mean, I think you're seeing a lot more looser silhouette. I spoke to the tank, the shirtless tank that are performing really well. We've got double-digit comp there. I think we still have some work to do on the jackets, but we've got a great fleece program coming in the fall both for men's and women's. So I don't -- I mean, your question was how far are we along. I think you're going to continue to see there's a lot of fabric innovation. There's a lot of silhouette innovation. So I mean, it's -- I don't think it's ever a finished project. It's a little bit like the pant wall. We're going to continue to innovate, and you're seeing a lot of it on the floor coming in the second half. But there is -- I mean, when I think about the new fabrics and the silhouettes and the textures and the print coming in spring of '17, I mean, I'm -- I think we've got a lot of room to continue to grow. I mean, if you think about the ratio to pants, I mean, we're starting to grow that ratio again. And fully reaching the ratio of tops to pants, I mean, really creates a lot of room for growth. Paul Lejuez : And Laurent, can you just remind us what that ratio is? Laurent Potdevin : Right now, it's about 1.2 or 1.3. Stuart Haselden : Yes, then we could easily see that expanding to over 1.5. Laurent Potdevin : Yes, yes. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Cody Ross : It's actually Cody Ross on for Adrienne this afternoon. Just a quick question. There recently was a large bankruptcy of a shipper. Do you guys think that this will have a big impact in your business in the rest of the year? And has your guidance contemplated this at all? Stuart Haselden : Cody, it's Stuart. So we don't have any concerns about our supply chain or our suppliers or the shipping partners that we use. So we have close relationships with blue chip partners and really no concerns at all there and have seen no disruptions in our shipping partners or supply chain broadly. And our guidance reflects our confidence in our supply chain structure. Operator : The next question comes from Jessica Schmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jessica Schmidt : I guess, can you just elaborate a little bit on what the response has been from some of the new products that started coming out under -- I think it started coming out over the past few weeks and how that's sort of resonating with the customers so far? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, I mean, it's been -- I mean, I think you see that actually in -- we talked about the traffic headwinds and when you see the UPT and the AUR and the level of conversion, I mean, I think that really speaks for the product. I mean, in August, actually, I think we ended up being really lean with some of our summer products. And I actually think it's a great position to be in. I mean, it speaks for how quickly the products flew off the shelf. And we probably left some business on the table in some of these new products that flow through the store and through online, so really, really pleased with not only the assortment, but how the assortment merchandises together. So I mentioned that on our last call, but we used to have really sort of different vision and design and print and colors for studio and cardio, and all of that now being an overarching vision that actually extends to the men's category, really allows our guests to put outfits together more easily and in a more powerful way. So very pleased with what we're seeing so far. Operator : The next question comes from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Laurent, it was really interesting what you said about locals. I really would like to talk a little bit more about that. Can you give us any more information? Where would it be appropriate to open these small stores? Are we talking places like Aspen, Colorado? Or are we talking about some -- an opportunity to really reach out and get meaningful distribution physically with this format? Laurent Potdevin : Well, I mean, if you think about -- I mean, I think Aspen is a great example. You can think about mountain resorts. You can think about fish [ph] communities. You can think about influencing communities, where we don't have the need for a full store. And when you think about our international expansion and what we're doing globally, I mean, we have a \"Local in Tokyo.\" So in Harajuku, we've got a 900 square foot location that's absolutely gorgeous and that's getting a lot of traffic. And it's really -- and I can see them -- I could see having a lot of locals in Tokyo where you have one that's dedicated to men, one that's  dedicated to run. So I think it's influencing communities. It's resorts [ph], it's smaller market. But especially with everything we're building from a digital standpoint, I mean, we can really support -- having the ability of the product assortment in a more nimble and -- in a more nimble way and with a lighter footprint. Matthew McClintock : And Stuart, if I could just real fast. Could you remind us how many remodels that you've done overall for the fleet in the last year and how many we should expect on a normal basis? Stuart Haselden : Yes. I think we did 10 last year and we have 12 planned for 2016. And similar, I would say, similar amount that I would expect going forward annually. Operator : The next question will come from Betty Chen of Mizuho Securities. Betty Chen : I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the traction you're seeing in Asia, especially in China? Are you seeing that customer purchase pattern any differently in terms of the mix or price points, or top to bottom? And then also, any change in terms of how quickly we could see those store rollout  plan? I know you mentioned what we should expect in the back half, but how about 2017 or beyond? Laurent Potdevin : Really, when you think about Asia, I mean, actually when we look at the product mix, I mean, we don't really see any significant difference in the assortment between the rest of the world and Asia, which is -- I mean, we really talk about building a globally inspired line which resonates with guests around the world. No significant deviation from what you're seeing in the rest of the world. I mean, what I'll say that on the Tmall, we see a very, very strong accessory business, and it's people that are [ph] engaging with the brand for the first time. And so we're pleased with that. As far as stores, I mean, the showrooms have been performing really, really well in China. Actually, when you think about Beijing and Shanghai, and so that's where we've being most focused. And the ambassador strategy is really working well. I mean, we had this amazing event a couple of days ago in the Forbidden City. We had 3,000 people doing yoga, and the event was done in partnership with Alibaba and sold overnight. So I mean, I really think that we've got momentum. We are focused on the right cities. And as far as the assortment, I mean, it's resonating. It's the same assortment that's resonating with the guests that we've seen in the rest of the world. Betty Chen : How about, Stuart, in terms of the 4-wall or ROI, how should we think about those stores performing? They are smaller, but is the rent typically a little bit higher? But with the higher productivity, is the 4-wall similar to North America? Stuart Haselden : Yes, we're pleased with the 4-wall economics. It is more expensive to do business in Asia and much of the world, and that translates into higher labor cost and higher rents. But we're still pleased at the 4-wall profits that we're seeing. It's probably 300 to 500 basis points lower than the North American -- the average for North America. But still, we're very happy with the level of profitably we're seeing. Laurent Potdevin : One thing that we see with consumer behavior, and you know that, is that they're obviously a lot more engaged from a mobile standpoint. So all the work that we're doing from a digital standpoint will allow us to sort of get to the new guests a lot faster and more efficiently and profitably.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Tham, Senior Vice President, Finance, for lululemon athletica inc. Please go ahead. Chris Tham : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Laurent Potdevin, CEO; and Stuart Haselden, CFO. Lee Holman, EVP Creative Director, will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.  Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of the company's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in the company's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another strong quarter with revenues of $544 million and normalized diluted EPS of $0.47, representing earnings growth of 34% versus last year, a substantial inflection point for lululemon. Similarly to last year, as we entered Q4, sales results have been mixed with a more recent strengthening in the China, and Stuart will offer more details later on our outlook.  That said, we continue to be on track with our 5-year plan of doubling our revenue and more than doubling our earnings as we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategies, ranging from product innovation, expanding our international footprint, building a $1 billion men's category and connecting our global collective to our digital ecosystem. In the most recent quarter, we saw the top line momentum from the first half of the year continue as we delivered a plus 7% combined comp. A critical component of our success in Q3 was our gross margin performance. The ongoing focus on our supply chain, upgrading our sourcing and our logistic structure drove a 420 basis point gross margin improvement over the past year. This gross margin expansion is a key element in the earnings recovery that we see today and expect going forward. Taking a closer look at our result this quarter. We delivered a mid-single-digit comp in both tops and bottoms within the women's category, with our bra revenue growing more than 20%. Our performance in tops and tanks was perfectly illustrated by the success of layer combination, such as our scoop tank, a lightweight self-lift top, which paired beautifully with our Free To Be Zen and Energy Bras.  As you will remember, we completely redesigned our pant wall a year ago. The 11% comp we experienced in this category in Q3 validates the strength of our assortment as this anchor category continues to resonate with our guests.  The Align Pant, which uses our exclusive Nulu fabric, has become our #1 pant style in less than 1 year. Continuing to build on the Naked Sensation family, we just introduced the Nulux fabric designed for high-sweat and high-intensity training. The Like Nothing Pant, made with Nulux, landed in the top 5 new styles introduction, demonstrating that our focus on innovation results in fantastic guest demand. In our men's category, we delivered another mid-teens comp in Q3, consistent with the momentum from the first half of the year. We continue to see strong performance with our key franchises, ABC construction, Metal Vent and shorts. And as we focused on innovation and expanding our product offering, we showcase the collaborative creation process with our athletes through the voice of our Advanced Concepts team. The story highlighted our technical outerwear focused on thermoregulation, breathability and active layering systems, along with the design and craftsmanship of the garments. The outerwear collection was designed for cold-weather workouts as well as urban commuting and travel. At the pinnacle of our innovation, we were excited to introduce the Einn Shell, engineered from a single pattern piece to reduce weight without sacrificing function. Our Whitespace R&D team worked out the critical attributes minimizing weight and distractions in the garment while achieving the highest level of performance in an outdoor environment.  Turning to the key strategies that will drive the success of our 5-year plan. I will now highlight our progress within product innovation, international expansion, building our digital ecosystem and last, but not least, maximizing our North American potential. Starting with product innovation. Our design vision continues to cut through with the application of more intentional and beautiful craft details grounded in function. These details are what sets us apart and what our guest continues to expect from us. We introduced new artwork and texture in our Rest Less series, which is an expansion of our women's seamless assortment. And we continue to stand for critical fabric innovation for sweat across both women's and men's.  While I cannot completely share the full plan with you, what I can tell you is that we'll be coming up with fantastic innovation in the bra category in 2017. Earlier this year, we opened our second lab concept on Bond Street in New York. Bringing our lab innovation to a broader audience for the first time, we launched the Splatter Reflective run collection both in our lab and online in October. The collection featured raw materials and prints that created a unique texturized reflectivity. We also launched a couple of men's products from our lab store online, which offered a variety of new silhouettes, including the Vector Jacket, a hybrid design that combines a button down shirt and jacket. Our labs, both in Vancouver and New York, are incubators for design, innovation and style exploration, and our lab strategy is gaining momentum, stretching beyond just 2 locations. You can expect to see the presence of lab-inspired products and designs offered online and in selected locations in the future. This winter, we are introducing specific innovation for men with abrasion-resistant yarns and thermal regulating benefits. Expanding on the Metal Vent Tech franchise, we're excited to introduce Metal Vent Tech Wool, which is a wool/yarn technology to keep our guests warmer and dryer during their athletic pursuits.  Turning to international. We are accelerating our expansion in China by densifying our presence in Shanghai and Beijing. This month, we will be opening our first 3 stores in China. We are operating 2 stores in Shanghai, the first at the financial hub IFC center with an outstanding 2,150 square foot location. Our second store in Shanghai will be located at Kerry Center, a 2,250 store location on Nanjing West Road. This premium area for shopping and business hosts a blend of local and Western culture, and both locations will benefit from a high volume of qualified traffic. Building on these first 2 locations, we're planning to open 2 to 3 additional stores in Shanghai next year.  In Beijing, we will open our first store in Sanlitun in the next few weeks. And to further accelerate our presence in China, we're also launching our local [indiscernible] in site later this quarter. I'm flying up to Shanghai tonight to be with our team and I'm proud of what they've accomplished in a short amount of time, growing this important and strategic market. These openings are happening on the heels of our performance on Alibaba's Singles' Day on November 11, the world's largest online shopping day. Our team on-site greatly exceeded our expectations, generating above 10,000 orders in 1 day.  In Europe, we are opening our international flagship store in Regent Street in London mid-January 2017. This iconic 8,200-square foot location is one of the best shopping streets in the world. To build momentum and celebrate the opening, we will be releasing a limited collection of products designed in collaboration with Central Saint Martins, where students and our in-house concept team partnered to create a print and textile capsule collection that draws inspiration from the great outdoors and nature's perfect imperfections. These fantastic locations in both in China and London will be key in continuing to build international brand awareness. Moving to our digital strategy. Our focus has been on bringing to life our design vision told through a combination of engaging story-telling, personalization and product assortment, while making the commerce experience scalable, easy and frictionless. We continue to leverage our CM engine to drive digital marketing campaigns, local store activities and events with deeper segmentation and knowledge of our guests, further enhancing our guest loyalty and experience. By using a channel-agnostic model, digital continues to boost the success of all of our channels. In Q3, we launched store inventory lookup on our mobile app and website, allowing our guests to see what inventory is in our store as well as the ability to ship from stores. We've also extended our platform globally, having completed our website redesign with the launch in EMEA and Asia Pacific, giving our guests a seamless experience. Finally, with our North American business. We continue to optimize and grow our store portfolio through a combination of standard store, expanded co-located stores and local that are uniquely tailored to their market and community. I'm particularly thrilled with the continued success of our expanded co-located stores. These approximately 5,000-square foot locations allow us to showcase a broader assortment of the men's line. In Q3, we reopened our yogawear store in Toronto situated in one of Canada's leading luxury malls. In addition to an expanded men's area, the stores include a personal shop service, where guests can receive one-on-one personalized consultations and fit sessions. Since the store opened, sales are up 35% while the men's business has increased over 60%. In the U.S, we just reopened Scottsdale Quarter, Wednesday before Black Friday. The store is now 60% larger. And so far, we've seen similar performance. We also opened our first 3 locals, which are locations under 2,000 square feet that allow us to enter intimate communities, create unique and curated experiences and build our brand. These locations are in Fort Collins, Colorado; Bend, Oregon; and Sun Valley, Idaho. We've seen tremendous success from our locals concept and have plans for additional locals next year.  We believe that this is a strategy that can apply anywhere in the world and is an exciting evolution of our showroom model. As is evidenced with our locals, engaging with our community and our guest in a unique and relevant way remains a powerful tool and differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are staying connected with our guests in unique ways. Our sweat box in New York, which is mobile pop-up complete with a treadmill, provided new guests with an opportunity to test our new run-specific technical gear. And as many of you have seen on various social channels, we kicked off the holiday with The Air Out There campaign. Building on this campaign, we also launched lululemon's first ever winter guest log book, which showcases our cold-weather technical gear with breathtaking images shot in Norway. With all of our strategy initiatives gaining momentum, we are on track to deliver on our long-term goals and this would not be possible without an amazing team of leaders, who inspire me every day with their passion for lululemon and what our collective stands for.  With people in mind, I'm excited to announce an important organizational updates. I'm thrilled to share Celeste Burgoyne's promotion to EVP Americas Retail. With over a decade at lululemon, Celeste is a powerful leader, who embodies our culture, values and consistently deliver exceptional results as she leads our largest team and operation. The Americas remain a critical part of our future and I could not envision a more inspiring leader to continue unlocking this potential.  Son Cho [ph] has joined lululemon as our Senior Vice President of Global Merchandising. Son [ph] has an extraordinary background leading global merchant teams, coming to us most recently from Marc Jacobs, where she held the role of Chief Global Product Merchant. Son [ph] will be instrumental in partnering with our design and innovation teams to continue to refine our merchandising capabilities and bring our design vision to life globally.  Greg Hurley joins us in Vancouver in the newly created role of SVP Global Store Design and Development. Greg will lead all of our real estate functions and setting the overall vision for store openings, relocations and remodels. Greg joins us most recently from Tesla Motors and prior to that, Apple, with over 20 years' experience in international real estate design and construction to infuse innovation and good boundaries to create one-of-a-kind experiences for our guests.  And joining us at the end of January is our new GM for EMEA, Gareth Pope, who will be based in our London office. Gareth has built his career expanding the global footprint of well-known brands, having most recently served as Converse GM for EMEA. Gareth's deep understanding of the European market will be invaluable in our international expansion. In summary, I'm really happy with our continued progress and excited for the future. The holiday season is what we gear up for all year and I'm grateful for our thousands of educators, who bring their passion, energy and commitment to build our collective around the world. With that, I will now turn the call over to Stuart, who will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide guidance on full year. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. I will start by offering some additional color and details on the third quarter results before discussing our current outlook for the fourth quarter and the resulting full year 2016. The third quarter was an important period that marked the achievement of several milestones toward which we have been working for the last couple of years. As Laurent mentioned, the gross margin results in the third quarter exceeded expectations as our supply chain efforts to recover our product margins are now in full swing. This recovery is continuing into Q4 and will extend into 2017 and become our new margin architecture. We also posted a moderating SG&A rate increase as expected, which enabled us to deliver strong flow-through on the continued top line momentum across all channels and regions. The resulting 36% increase in operating profit and nearly 300 basis points of EBIT margin expansion speaks for itself. And we are pleased to see the story continuing into the current quarter on which I'll offer details momentarily. But first, I'd like to review the details of Q3.  Total net revenue rose 13.5% to $544.4 million. The increase in revenue was driven by several factors. First, total constant-dollar comparable sales growth of 7% comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 4% and an e-commerce comp of 16%. We also increased total square footage by 11% versus last year, driven by the addition of 35 net new company-operated stores since Q3 of 2015 : 14 net new stores in the United States, 2 stores in Canada, 4 in Europe, 3 in Asia, 13 ivivva stores and offset with 1 store closure in Australia. We continue to be pleased with the strength of our store portfolio, where we've seen positive comps consistently across all age classes since last year. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact on reported revenues in Q3, increasing revenues by $700,000. At the end of Q3, we also had a total of 56 showrooms in operation, 20 in international markets and 36 in North America. Revenues from company-operated stores totaled $393.5 million or 72.3% of total revenue compared to 73.7% of total revenue a year ago. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $104 million or 19.1% of total revenue compared to 18.6% of total revenue in the third quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes outlets, showrooms, strategic sales, franchises, pop-up stores and warehouse sales, totaled $46.9 million versus $37 million in the third quarter of last year. Gross profit for the third quarter was $278.4 million or 51.1% of net revenue compared to $224.8 million or 46.9% of net revenue in Q3 2015, an increase of 420 basis points. The factors that contributed to this outcome include : a 450 basis point increase in product margin, driven primarily by higher merchandise margins from lower average unit costs and improved AURs; markdowns for the quarter had a nominal impact to product margin on a year-over-year basis. We maintained a measured level of clearance activity across our channels in Q3 as we lapped the physical warehouse sale in Boston last year. This ensured a healthy inventory position as we entered Q4. We also saw continued success in expanding our ship-from-store program that reflects the evolution of our omni-channel model. Specifically, we were able to leverage the clearance section of our website to move slower-selling styles in over 80 of our stores at a superior margin than we would have otherwise. This is a new capability introduced this year that we continue to scale.  We also saw 20 basis points of gross margin improvement due to foreign exchange. Offsetting these improvements and product margin was 50 basis points of deleverage from investments in our design, merchandising and supply chain functions that are included in our cost of goods sold. Store occupancy and depreciation expense growth had a slight benefit to gross margin for the quarter. SG&A expenses were $185.5 million or 34.1% of net revenue compared to $156.6 million or 32.7% of net revenue for the same period last year. The 140 basis point increase in SG&A rate was driven by increases in store and overall employee costs including annual incentive and stock-based compensation expenses, continued investments in areas such as digital, brand and IT functions and investments to drive top line such as digital, marketing, product campaigns and related brand marketing costs. These were offset with an increase in net foreign exchange gains compared to Q3 2015. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $93 million or 17.1% of net revenue compared with $68.2 million or 14.2% of net revenue in Q3 2015, an increase of 290 basis points.  Tax expense for the quarter was $25.3 million or 27% of pretax earnings compared to 18.6% a year ago. In the third quarter this year, we recorded a $4 million recovery that is connected to the company's transfer pricing arrangements and an associated repatriation of foreign earnings. This compares to a tax recovery adjustment in Q3 2015 of $7.7 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter 2016, excluding the above tax adjustments and associated interest costs would have been 31.3%. Net income for the quarter was $68.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share. This is compared to net income of $53.2 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the tax and related interest adjustments, diluted earnings per share in Q3 would have been $0.47 compared to $0.35 last year or an increase of 34%. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 137.2 million versus 140.5 million a year ago. This reduction is due to our recent stock repurchase program that was completed in Q2.  At our recent Board meeting, we received approval to repurchase an additional $100 million of our common shares in the open market at prevailing market prices. The program is intended to create shareholder value by making opportunistic repurchases during periods of favorable market conditions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. And finally, capital expenditures were $34.9 million for the quarter compared to $42.9 million in the third quarter last year.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $480.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $364.5 million or 2% higher than at the end of the third quarter of 2015, reflecting an 8% decrease in inventory per square foot. We expect our inventory growth at the end of the fourth quarter to now be more in line with our forward sales trend, which also takes into account in-transit inventory movement to manage around the product flows during Chinese New Year. Now turning to our outlook for Q4 and the resulting full year 2016. Like many others, we expense a slow start to Q4 in the first 3 weeks of November. Since then, we've seen a strengthening trend into week 4 with the Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday being particularly strong and continuing into December.  While we are encouraged by the recent trend and believe we will deliver a mid-single-digit constant dollar comp for the fourth quarter, we are updating our guidance to reflect a Q4 revenue range of $765 million to $785 million. This revenue range also reflects the opening of 15 net new stores in the quarter and a Canadian dollar at CAD 0.74 to the U.S. dollar, which is CAD 0.03 lower than the CAD 0.77 assumed in our prior guidance, and an approximate impact of $5 million to our prior revenue guidance.  The gross margin inflection that began in Q2 and Q3 is now extending into Q4. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate gross margin to increase by approximately 300 to 350 basis points over Q4 of last year. The improvements in our supply chain efficiencies and product costing that accounted for the Q3 gross margin expansion are the same factors now driving these improvements in Q4. Again, offset by slight deleverage in occupancy and depreciation and also in product and supply chain costs. We expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to delever by approximately 150 basis points. This SG&A outlook reflects investments associated with brand marketing, digital and IT areas of the business. Assuming a tax rate of 31.2% and 137.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.01 per share versus normalized diluted earnings per share of $0.85 a year ago. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.32 billion to $2.34 billion. This is based on comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to have opened 42 company-operated stores by year-end, which represents a square footage increase of approximately 11.5%.  We expect gross margins for the year to increase from 2015, driven by the significant improvements in our sourcing and supply chain structure. We expect deleverage in full year SG&A versus 2015, driven by the strategic investments that were mentioned earlier, principally in supply chain, brand, digital, CRM and IT systems, along with the net FX revaluation losses incurred so far this year.  Importantly, as our infrastructure investments moderate into next year, we expect to see a modest level of SG&A leverage in 2017 while still continuing to invest in our critical growth strategies. We will provide more specific guidance for 2017 as part of our Q4 call. We now expect our fiscal year 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.23 or $2.11 to $2.16 normalized for the tax and related interest adjustments incurred this year. This is based off of 137.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding and also assumes an effective tax rate of 28.2% or 30.9% on a normalized basis. We expect capital expenditures to range between $165 million to $170 million for the fiscal year 2016, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital, IT, supply chain and head office capital investments. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Tunick of RBC. Brian Tunick : I guess, first question for Stuart. I think you talked about 300 basis points of gross margin opportunity to recover from the 2014, I think, year-end levels. So just wondering, given what we've seen here, given what you're commenting on from Q4 guidance, any thoughts on a timing perspective of recapturing the 300 basis points or are there other levers to pull? And similarly on the pricing side, I guess, now that you're going to be lapping some of the price increases from Q4 last year, are there any elasticity or category learnings you can share with us on what you're seeing on your increased pricing? Stuart Haselden : Brian, it's Stuart. So absolutely. On the first question you have there on the gross margin recovery, first, we're really pleased with what we've seen in the quarter. The most recent quarter exceeded our expectations. As we've looked at the original goal that we had, of recovering the 300 basis points of product margin from 2014, and I'll remind you that was excluding the impact of FX, we are in the third quarter now in that range of recovery. And we expect to see that extend certainly into the fourth quarter and into, I would say, the greatest degree of inflection will occur in the second half of this year and into the first half of next year. And I think that's consistent with how we have framed it previously for folks. So we're pleased to be on track for that level of gross margin recovery. We believe that beyond the middle of next year, it becomes a structural element of our business model. We will see more modest improvements from that point forward and it connects to our broader 5-year goal that we'd outlined back in March of achieving a $4 billion business by 2020 with our gross margin starting with a 5 and our EBIT margin starting with a 2. And so I think this is an important milestone for the company and an important step in achieving that level of profitability and affirming very positively the progress against those goals. So and then on to your other question regarding pricing. We have really, over the last, I would say 12 to 18 months, built a new muscle within the company within our merchandising team around pricing. And it started with a very important project that BCG led for us. It actually helped us step from that project away from not just understanding where our pricing architecture fits within the industry, but also helping us build the internal processes so that we can have a more sophisticated approach to how we price our goods. I would say we've certainly benefited from that over the last, call it, 12 months. But as we look forward, the AUR improvements that we will see are not simply just raising prices. It becomes just a more robust process where we look for opportunities from a mix standpoint that will improve AURs, not just this year, but going forward. So where we see opportunities to evolve the mix of our business, those can and often will bring with them AUR upside, and it doesn't necessarily mean a price increase. So I think that's an important part of the business model that we need to help folks understand. From an elasticity standpoint, we're very pleased with what we saw from some of the more meaningful price moves that we made end of last year into this year. We made more measured moves in other regions, including Canada. And we're still collecting and evaluating those additional pricing moves. So overall, very pleased with the results of the specific moves. But even more importantly, pleased with the new capabilities regarding pricing that we've developed within the company. Laurent Potdevin : And Brian, I would remind everybody that a lot of our pricing strategy and the transition that we've made are being driven by innovation. So when you look at us launching the Nulu fabric and the alignment last year or the Nulux fabric, I mean, when we deliver innovation to our guests, I mean, we actually -- and where you see the value, we actually see very little resistance. So I mean, those pricing -- the pricing strategy has been driven for the vast majority of the product by innovation. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think multiyear, what's the best way to break down your mid-single-digit total company same-store sales target? Meaning, what kind of growth are you embedding between tops, bottoms and men's to hit that mid-single-digits on a multiyear going forward? Stuart Haselden : Matt, it's Stuart. So we certainly feel like that level of comp is sustainable. And that's how we think about our top line picture over the next 5 years. And as we had shared, we see our men's business growing in penetration somewhere in the ballpark of 25% of the total by 2020. That implies a faster growth pace for men's. The double-digit comps that we've seen in men's, we feel like we're just getting started. And we're thrilled with the momentum that we have in men's, but we see a tremendous amount of opportunities in front of us in that business. We've also been really pleased with the momentum that we've seen in women's pants. We had a very successful pant launch, pant wall launch last Q3. I think Laurent mentioned in his prepared remarks, we posted double-digit comp in women's pants in the third quarter of this year. We're seeing really strong momentum in women's pants into Q4, which really speaks to our ability to comp that business and drive innovation into our products consistently. And there's -- and Laurent mentioned some of the new fabrics and new designs that we have in women's pants. Maybe I'll pause there and let -- give the floor to Lee maybe speak a little bit more about some of the innovation in our product strategy that will drive that mid-single-digit comp. Lee Holman : Yes, I think it's just really exciting as you see Q3 come to fruition, there's been a pipeline of fabric innovation that's coming to our guests. I think this is just the start of the journey. You can see that we're bringing it to our women's pants business from 12 months ago with Nulu, then Nulux come in. And you can see that being see scale maximizing 2017. But then as Stuart said, just getting into the men's business, you'll see really leveraging our franchises around ABC, the Metal Vent and also our technical shorts and other innovation as we go through the year. So I'm very excited about the team's work and how we're bringing that together. And I think on the men's line [ph], just recently recruiting Ben Stubbington into the men's Senior Vice President job, just really actually elevates our talent across the leadership in design and merchandising. So really excited about the future and this is just the starting point of our -- how we land innovation to our guests. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up, as we move forward, what's the best way to think about square footage growth into next year versus the low double-digit pace this year? And just the profitability of international today and the opportunity as you see it? Stuart Haselden : So Matt, on the square footage question, I think what you're seeing in 2016 is the pace of square footage growth we would expect to see going forward over the next few years. The mix of how we will deliver that will evolve, obviously. We're really pleased with the progress in China, in particular. And that will become a growing and more important part of the square footage growth story. Maybe I'll let Laurent speak to the international strategy. Laurent Potdevin : I mean, as far as international, I mean, we talked in the remarks about the acceleration in China and the densification in Shanghai and Beijing. So I'm really, really excited about that and really excited about the location that the team has been able to secure. So and I'll see that. I'm flying there tonight. And so we said that by 2017, we'll have about 20 stores both in Europe and in Asia, and we'll be breaking even by the end of 2017. I think that what you're going to -- that statement is totally relevant. You're going to see an acceleration in Asia we've had a lot of momentum and a greater level of profitability. In Europe, we're going to be a little bit more patient, but the overall international picture really remains the same. Operator : The next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company. Oliver Chen : We had a question. Your omni-channel experience has really gotten much better and more exciting and more of a lifestyle picture. What do you think about the long-term prospects of how you will strategically utilize the We Made Too Much in terms of just making sure that you stay a brand appropriate as you engage in using that as an efficient way? And Stuart, on the markdowns for Q4, what are we -- what are you incorporating in terms of markdowns versus last year for Q4? It has been a tough industry environment for traffic volatility. So curious about your thoughts there. It sounds like your inventories are really under control. And Laurent, I had a question on tops. We were in the stores today, and we've seen a lot of nice moves towards flowy away from built-in, but built-in also having a strong offering. Just is that a permanent shift that you're seeing? Or is it kind of seasonal or cyclical? Would love your thoughts. Laurent Potdevin : So thanks, Oliver. I mean, I'd love to answer the question on tops. But I think Lee is going to do that much better than I will, so I'll let him speak to that. But quickly on your question on the We Made Too Much. I mean, our strategy is really clear. I mean, we're not making product for that section. We're not planning with that section in mind. And I think actually what we've seen recently, with being able to leverage the store -- the ship-from-store is actually allowing us to use that section to really clean up our inventory at a higher margin so I'm really, really pleased with that. So it's a matter of being really agile and using it as a really efficient tool and certainly, not building that as a category that -- or as section that we rely on. So that's on the why We Made Too Much. I mean, maybe Stuart can chime in on -- yes, second part of your question and then Lee can talk about tops. Stuart Haselden : Sure.  Yes, and on the -- and Oliver, on the We Made Too Much, so we're going to continue to leverage the various levers that we have to clear inventory that you're aware of. And we're just -- we're really pleased to have this new capability with ship from store that enables us to move this inventory, these slower-moving styles just more efficiently at a higher margin with a great guest experience. So this is -- I think in the quarter and what's been written, I think this is one of the most misunderstood parts of our business model right now. And so you simply -- you can't simply look at the style count on the clearance page on the website. It's not an apples-to-apples comparison to last year or even last week. As we are continuing to add new stores into the program, we're up to over 80 stores that participate in that today. And we'll obviously continue to evaluate what the most effective presentation of that page is and balance that with the overall experience for the guest on the website. But again, really, really pleased with the results. And I think it is reflected in the margin results and certainly the markdown results that we just reported. Lee Holman : Yes, and Oliver, on the tops, thank you for recognizing the shift that we've made. It's really had a focused team cross functionally to work on our tops business. And it really came down to leading with sweat with innovation and having a balanced assortment from shelf to shelfless tanks. We're leading with, obviously, our sculpt tank. But as you can see in the comps in our bras, really going back to some of our key franchises, from Free To Be -- the Free To Be Zen that we introduced and then Tranquil. And then how then are our guests wearing our tops together. So having really a diverse portfolio of fabrics from Pima cottons some of our silver innovation platforms. But really getting to -- close to our guests, understanding how people are sweating and transition through their day, as people are leaving more from a -- kind of a moving more in their lifestyle. So really tapping into that, but really around a balanced assortment. So I'm really happy about where we are and also the future opportunity around tops. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : As of last quarter -- I think as of last quarter, you had a few regions in Canada that were underperforming. I'm curious if you've seen any improvement in those regions. Maybe also just more broadly, can you talk about U.S. versus Canada performance and particularly on the traffic side? Stuart Haselden : Paul, it's Stuart. So yes, I think we had mentioned the underperformance in certain parts of Canada that the oil-producing regions have been challenged just from a broad macro economy standpoint. That generally continues to be the case. Canada, overall, in the third quarter performed well even with the soft trend in Alberta, in particular. And so as a result, there wasn't really a headline to call out in terms of Canada outperforming or underperforming the U.S. in the third quarter. And so the -- as we look forward to the fourth quarter, you've seen the choppy trends that we had described in the prepared remarks and we're looking to lean in and drive the business, where we see opportunities geographically. And we've seen some important store optimizations in Canada. I think we had 3 in the third quarter, 2 in the U.S., the Toronto optimization, in particular, was a very successful one. So we're pleased with how we're being able to find opportunities to evolve the square footage strategy in Canada, where we probably didn't see as much opportunity previously. And there's obviously more opportunity yet remaining in the U.S. from a square footage standpoint. So I think those are the headlines I'd call out. Laurent, I don't know if there's anything else you'd add? Laurent Potdevin : Well, the only thing that I would say from a Q4 standpoint in Canada is that I just recently visited a number of stores, and I think we've done \u2013 first of all, our people are incredibly energized. I mean, the store looked great and we've had a real focus on continuing to really engage with the communities and a real focus on digital merchandising and some of the windows. So I think that, as I said earlier, I mean, like the holiday season is what we gear up and the energy that I've seen in the stores and how good the stores look really give me a lot of confidence in our people's ability to really maximize the season that we love the most. Paul Lejuez : And any color on the traffic trends, Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Yes. On traffic, first, as we've said, we've been pleased with our comps and how we drove them over the course of the full year, not just Q3. And this has really also supported our margin outcome. And our focus with regard to traffic is in driving quality traffic to support a premium full price business. We're not simply going after every last bit of traffic possible. We're driving comps with higher AURs in a very healthy way for our brand. That said, while our store traffic is slightly negative, it is consistent with the trends that we've seen throughout the year and is substantially better than most of what we see reported in the industry broadly. And this -- the traffic that is out there today tends to be more serious about making purchases and not just window shopping. So we are still seeing healthy traffic from these guests. And as we look into Q4, there's really no reason that the Q4 traffic or the composition of our comps should be -- should really be that much different than it has been all year. So I think that's -- those are the headlines on traffic and why we remain confident in our comp trends. Laurent Potdevin : And when you think about traffic, I mean, obviously, I mean, the macro environment is what it is and we think it will stabilize. It's interesting to see the balance of online and brick-and-mortar and how it's happening. When you think about Amazon Go just launching their third grocery store, right? So I mean, we think it will stabilize and we're not waiting for it to stabilize. I think that's why we are really thrilled to continue to really push the colocated expanded format basically as we grow the men's business and we see the acceleration and as we grow the assortment. So those colocated stores, I mean, we know we've got highly qualified traffic, they are very vibrant communities. So that's really, really powerful. And then on the flip side, the locals, where we can be very nimble and very agile in entering some communities and leveraging our digital ecosystem to continue to drive traffic. So I think we've got -- we're not waiting for the macro environment to change. We think it will stabilize and we're taking steps. And then I would add that on game day and during the holiday season, I mean, we know how to drive traffic and our people are the best. On Black Friday, we had a plus 16% comp in the U.S. and on Cyber Monday, a plus 29% comp. And I think what's more exciting in those comps is that the full price comps were very similar to the overall comps. So that really speaks to not only our ability to drive traffic, but also our ability to continue to be the leading brand that sells merchandise at full price. Operator : The next question comes from Betty Chen of Mizuho Securities Betty Chen : I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about ivivva. The stores that we've seen, they look terrific. Seems like there's growing brand awareness. Certainly, that seems to be another big opportunity for the company as a whole. Can you talk about what you're seeing there? Any comp trends and any sort of latest thoughts around productivity and openings? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, you know what, I mean, we're actually really excited about ivivva. Actually, one thing that I did not mention on the call is Kristy Maynes, who was running Europe and who has been with us for quite a few years and is a very strong operator who was running Europe, recently relocated back in Vancouver and is leading the charge at ivivva. So for the first time, ivivva is actually looked as a standalone brand with a General Manager. And I'm thrilled to have her run this brand reporting into Celeste, and that's why we have Gareth coming in Europe. And so I think that the goal in 2017 is really to accelerate both the growth and also the profitability of ivivva by being a separate brand and being a guest that we've got between the ages of 8 and 12, is do we maximize the 4 years that we've got with these young guests and really looking at disrupting the model a little bit. So continuing to have those amazing experience, but how do we do that differently and more profitably? So really continuing to push what we do best with ivivva, which is engaging with that demographic, but really also having permission to disrupt the model and potentially look at the different distributions in different categories. So you'll see accelerated profitability in '17 and probably some evolution of the business model. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Stuart, I guess you talked about being able to leverage the clearance section on the website, move slower-selling styles in 80 of the stores. I'm just kind of curious, is there a plan to kind of move that technology into the remaining 300 stores? And then if so, is there timing behind that? And then just a quick follow-up. You talked about brand marketing as a driver of the higher SG&A in Q4. Just curious more color on that. Is that overseas marketing? Is that domestic? And then kind of how you think about your marketing spend as we go into '17? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Ike, so on the -- your first question. The number of stores that will participate in the ship-from-store is still a moving target. I would not necessarily expect that every store would necessarily participate in it. As we look at the size of the stores, the density of inventory and we set the parameters for what makes sense in terms of how we will be able to tap that inventory reliably to support web sales, we're still landing the exact algorithm for which stores are going to be good candidates to participate. So certainly, suffice it to say, we like it to be as many as possible. There's not a set timing other than I would expect it'll likely unfold probably over the next 18 months will land what the full penetration of store participation could look like, but that's something we can certainly continue to keep you abreast of. The -- on your second question with regard to brand marketing. It's -- we have a, as Laurent mentioned, we have a powerful and disruptive community marketing model. And that's something we're continuing to invest in aggressively. And so it's the elements of the model that you're familiar with in terms of how we get our educators into our communities to make those connections with our guests and our ambassadors, just continuing to evolve that model. And but then there's also investments that we're making from a brand standpoint to continue to explore are there new ways that we can maybe be louder in how we communicate the brand outside of the stand as well time-tested community model strategies. Are there other ways we can leverage a brand marketing voice. So that's -- we've invested into that into the second half of the year with the team here, led by Duke Stump. And so that's something that we'll be looking to expand and test in different ways into next year. So more to follow on that likely on the Q4 call, but that's something that's really coming together as we speak. Operator : The next question comes from Jessica Schmidt of KeyBanc. Jessica Schmidt : Can you talk about the competitive environment and sort of the higher-end yoga athletic category? And with some of the new product you launched, with the new fashion and technical components, I guess, do you think that these innovations are helping you maybe regain share? Stuart Haselden : So Jessica, yes, the competitive environment is -- it's crowded. It's a crowded space. And certainly, on one hand, we believe that it's growing the overall size of the pie, if you will. And I think, as Laurent had mentioned on previous calls, we view athleisure as a trend. And like all trends, it will come to an end, at some point. And those competitors who are not in the business in a high-quality manner are going to -- they're going to go away. So we view ourselves as, in many ways, a technology company that is investing in innovation to drive our business. And the pant wall launch last year and the continued investments in innovation that we have this year to continue to drive the business in that regard exemplifies when we invest in innovation, we win. Laurent Potdevin : Yes, I think it's really important to sort of differentiate from the athleisure trend and from how people want to live their lives. And I think that lululemon is the only brand out there that is truly a metaphor for how people want to live their lives and how they want to move. And that's true across gender, that's true globally. And we really actually don't see that lifestyle changing anytime soon. So I mean, you could argue that either the space is really crowded and we have a lot of competitors, or we have very few. And as long as we focus on function and innovation, and delivering value to our guests, I mean, we really don't see any risk to the market that we've created and the market that we continue to lead. So I'm really excited when I look at the runway of innovation, the categories that we can get into and the global sort of footprint that we're building. Lee Holman : Yes, and also, Jessica, I think just at the moment, I mean, you'll see actually as you go through the upcoming season just really heightened focus on building a pipeline in innovation. And I believe lululemon is very unique in a sense of our innovation team from the Whitespace but also Advanced Concept, and also we have different avenues of how we're building innovation from our lab strategy, also how we're gathering information from our ambassadors constantly and just really building out our pipeline. And I think you're going to see it come to fruition and really [indiscernible] scale and maximize. And I think the Nulu fabric is a good example of that being 12 months ago being launched and now being our #1 pant product, and I see that from Nulux as well, really building around at that sensation of naked and how you can build out in different areas of our business going forward. So I'm really excited about leading with innovation that really separates ourselves from the market. Stuart Haselden : Great. Thank you. Lee Holman : Thank you. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. I'll now turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Chris Tham : Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. Have a wonderful holiday, and we look forward to speaking again next quarter. Thank you. Stuart Haselden : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to share with you our strong fourth quarter and 2016 full year results. I will discuss current business trends and the initiatives in place to build momentum in the quarters ahead. Stuart will review our financials, provide 2017 guidance, and we'll then take your questions.  Let me start with our fourth quarter highlights. We delivered a very strong holiday season in the quarter, with operating income growth of 18%, driven by a healthy 7% constant dollar comp and gross margin improvement, up 390 basis points, which exceeded our expectations. I am proud and very grateful for the performance our teams delivered against the challenging macro environment. Our relentless focus on product and exceptional guest experiences allowed us to outperform during peak weeks, with strong full-price sell-through and merchandise margin. Taking a closer look at product. We continue to own our position as the leading brand for women's bottoms, comping 14% on top of a very strong Q4 last year. This was driven by the depth of our assortment in key franchises such as Align and wunder under and complemented by special editions such as tech mesh. In our bra category, the breadth of assortment drove a 10 comp, reflecting lululemon's strengthening position as the destination for active bras.  We are excited to see continuing strong momentum in our men's business, delivering a 20 comp this past quarter. From athletes, and as some of you may have seen, their coaches, to our growing male collective, our guest loyalty is driven by the core styles we're known for, with new editions such as Metal Vent Tech Wool and the License to Train capsule both performing very well.  Q4 also marked some significant milestones as we strengthened and amplified our global brand position. When we last spoke, I was on my way to China, where we opened our first 3 stores. Building on the energy of our Unroll China event last summer, I experienced firsthand the energy of our fantastic locations across Shanghai and Beijing.  These openings have been a catalyst in boosting our already strong performance across Asia. In addition, our presence on Tmall has shown tremendous growth, led by our performance on a Single's Day last quarter. Collectively, this reflects the strong brand affinity and the magnitude of opportunity ahead of us, and I'll speak to that later. In January, we opened our European flagship under London's Regent Street, one of the world's top shopping destinations. Reflecting our commitment and vision for the brand in the U.K. and Europe, this flagship features bespoke designs, concierge services and digital art installations. I am excited to build on the increased brand awareness since the Regent Street opening and the halo impact it will have across our European business.  2016 was a critical year and marks an exciting milestone for us. Just 3 years ago, we set on an ambitious agenda to reaccelerate our top line growth, regain our guests' trust and loyalty, build a digital culture, own our opportunity in men's and ignite our international potential, all while building a scalable supply chain infrastructure and focusing on operational efficiencies. The result of our work returned the company to positive operating earnings growth for the first time since 2013. Some significant highlights reflecting the strength of our strategy include : being design-led, blending fashion and function and building a solid innovation pipeline for both our men's and women's categories; evolving how we come to life in stores, from new formats, to connecting with new communities; our curiosity, relentless focus on innovation and discipline fuel our highly profitable physical presence in North America; setting the vision and building our digital ecosystem and culture; igniting international growth through expansion in key cities; rapidly building brand awareness outside of North America; maintaining strong industry-leading gross margin through completing the buildout of our supply chain infrastructure and focusing on operational efficiencies; and last but not least, building a world-class management team, filling key leadership roles across merchandising, digital, store design and leading our European expansion.  Our performance reflects the strength of lululemon and our unique position as the leading brand for an active, mindful lifestyle. Despite a slower start in Q1, 2017 is set up to be one of our most compelling years, with unprecedented product innovation and our sales global brand activations to drive growth towards our long-term vision. Looking specifically at Q1, let me articulate the immediate changes we have made to positively impact momentum this quarter and then share our plans for the future. The slowing sales trend in early Q1 has most acutely impacted e-commerce. We have clearly identified the issues : an assortment lacking depth in color for spring compounded with visual merchandising that did not powerfully translate our design vision. With focused urgency, our teams have been course-correcting the issues, with early indications reflecting an immediate and positive impact on performance. We will see more color in selected styles as early as next week. And from a visual merchandising standpoint, our Loud & Clear Jacket is the perfect example of what happens when we capture both design and function, infused with energy and movement into our e-com images. Since delivering these results, the performance of that jacket has significantly increased. Stuart will provide additional details on the first quarter.  As we write our next chapter of growth, I'd like to take a few minutes framing our 2017 priorities in the context of our 2020 plan to double revenues to $4 billion and more than double our earnings. Starting with brand, we have an untapped opportunity to tell the world who we are and what lululemon stands for. Beginning in early Q2, we'll launch our first global brand campaign, in partnership with a dynamic creative agency that is also the leading amplifier and distributor of content to millennials across the world. Through this disruptive and innovative campaign, we will strengthen our guest loyalty while also inspiring millions of new guests to join our growing collective.  Turning to product. The performance of our core business will be powerfully augmented, with an unprecedented current of innovation between now and the end of the year. In women's, we are on track to build a $3 billion business through our continued leadership in acclimatizing and innovating the fabrics and styles that define our standout performance in bottoms and bras. Leveraging the success of our #1 performing bottom, the Align Pants, we are thrilled to globally launch our new Fast And Free collection, designed with our top-performing Nulux fabric. For the first time, our innovative high-performance Naked Sensation, Nulux, will include a tights, crop and bra. Validated by Nulux' recent ascension as one of our guests' favorite technical fabrics, we know this launch will deliver substantial revenue for 2017 and beyond. Following extensive R&D, and in partnership with our athletes, in early May, we will reveal our newest whitespace innovation with a bold new concept that will disrupt the bra category and redefine women's expectations of active bras. This launch anchors our continued commitment to innovation that make lululemon the leading destination across our core women's categories. And last but not least, we have focused plans and resources in place to realize our substantial opportunities across outerwear and accessories in the second half of the year. Now turning to men's. This remains one of our largest growth opportunities and is on track to become a $1 billion-plus business by 2020. Our focus and talented cross-functional teams are bringing our men's vision to life. And with a clear design and direction and increasing brand awareness, we expect to see accelerated results beginning to take shape in the second half of the year. I'm excited by our men's performance, particularly within our co-located formats, where, for example, in our Mall Of America store, by doubling our dedicated men's square footage, we saw a 70% lift in the business with no increase in inventory. In 2017, we will open further co-located and local stores while optimizing our men's [ presence ] online to capture the significant runway ahead of us.  Shifting to digital. With the potential to grow in excess of $1 billion by 2020, we will continue to build our digital ecosystem this year and beyond. We are laser-focused on realizing the power of our CRM platform at scale and continuing the seamless expansion and integration of our omnichannel strategy to empower our guest-centric model for the future.  In Asia, to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity and unique digital landscape, we are building the infrastructure and a talented team in Shanghai to increase our reach, engagement and performance on a localized platform. As shared earlier, we will continue executing the immediate and longer-term strategies in place to accelerate our e-commerce growth, including inspiring our guests through more engaging visual merchandising, optimizing and expanding the online product assortment, improving guest experience to drive conversion and launching our new mobile app.  Turning to North America. We have substantial upside as we continued to ramp up our most established business. Our disciplined store expansion has produced a store fleet among the most productive and profitable in the industry. Our store teams are second to none, and we're continually inspired by their innovations, from new store formats to market optimization strategies. This year, we will target square footage growth of approximately 10%, with up to 28 new stores and 12 optimizations. This will also include additional locals, a strategic evolution of our showroom models, which has been successful in curating unique experiences and building brand awareness in smaller markets.  Looking towards our international potential. We are on track to build this into a $1 billion business by 2020. While pleased with our performance across our 3 major regions outside North America, our focus in 2017 will be on China. We will use a market densification strategy centered in Tier 1 cities, including Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou and Chengdu, with digital amplification to reach our guests across the entire region. With China's activewear market valued at $28 billion and growing, the world's largest middle class and over 450 million millennials living an increasingly active lifestyle, the magnitude of our opportunity in China is unparalleled. And the strong performance we've seen out of our store openings thus far gives us confidence in the market readiness as we accelerate our expansion.  Before I pass the call over to Stuart, I want to recognize the passion, commitment and creativity from our global teams who have all contributed to our success last year. With the goal of our ambitious 2020 plan to double revenue to $4 billion and more than double earnings in sight, we are on track to realize our vision through a constant flow of high-impact initiatives that will fuel our growth this year and beyond. At a time when experiences matter more than ever to consumers around the world, our vertical model puts us firmly in control of our destiny, and that destiny is one I wouldn't trade for any brand in the world. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Laurent. I'll begin today by reviewing the details of our fourth quarter 2016 and highlights on the year. I'll then introduce our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017 and spend some time offering additional color on the initiatives we have in place to deliver on our 2017 guidance and how this connects to our long-term growth plans.  The fourth quarter capped an important year for us that marked several milestones, including our successful efforts to recover our product margins as well as [ supporting ] progress against our strategic growth initiatives. In the quarter, we drove positive comps in both our store and direct channels, continued to extend significant gross margin improvements and ended the year in a healthy inventory position. This resulted in 18% operating profit growth versus last year and 130 basis points of operating margin expansion for the quarter. Turning to the details for Q4. Total net revenue rose 12.2% to $789.9 million, with the increase in revenue driven by a total constant dollar comparable sales growth of 7%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales increase of 6% and an e-commerce comp of 12%, and also an increase in square footage of 11% versus last year driven by the addition of 43 net new company-operated stores since Q4 of 2015 : 16 net new stores in the United States; 3 stores in Canada; 1 in Australia and New Zealand; 7 in Asia; 4 in Europe; and 12 ivivva stores. Foreign exchange had an effect of increasing reported revenue in Q4 by $2.8 million or 0.4%. During the fourth quarter, we opened 17 net new company- operated stores : 9 in North America; 4 in Asia; 2 in Australia and New Zealand; 1 in Europe; and 1 ivivva. We ended the quarter with 406 total stores versus 363 a year ago. There are now 346 stores in our comp base, 45 of those in Canada, 221 in the United States, 26 in Australia and New Zealand, 4 in Asia, 7 in Europe and 43 ivivva. At the end of Q4, we also had a total of 51 showrooms in operation, 16 lululemon showrooms in North America, 18 internationally and 17 ivivva. Company-operated stores represented 72.3% of total revenue. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $164.3 million or 20.8% of total revenue, a consistent rate with the fourth quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes strategic sales, showrooms, pop-up stores, warehouse sales and outlets, totaled $54.9 million versus $48.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  Gross profit for the quarter was $427.9 million or 54.2% of net revenue compared to $354.5 million or 50.3% of net revenue in Q4 2015. The factors which contributed to this 390 basis point increase in gross margin were 410 basis points of overall product margin increase primarily due to lower average unit costs and improved AUR, a continuation of the factors you saw driving the margin improvement in the third quarter. Markdowns continued to be well managed, with only 20 basis points year-over-year impact to product margin for the quarter. We also saw 10 basis points of leverage in product and supply chain overhead costs. These were offset by 20 basis points of deleverage from occupancy and depreciation and 10 basis points of decline due to the foreign exchange impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  SG&A expenses were $231.3 million or 29.3% of net revenue compared with $188.2 million or 26.7% of net revenue for the same period last year. This is 110 basis points above prior guidance of approximately 150 basis points of deleverage in the quarter and was the result of the following. Nearly half of this increase versus guidance is due to FX-related revaluation of U.S. dollar cash balances as we have seen the Canadian dollar strengthen significantly in the final weeks of the quarter. The balance of the increase was opportunistic investments to fuel long-term growth. As we have mentioned previously, when we see outperformance in sales and margin as we did in Q4, we will invest to continue to fuel our long-term growth. As a result, operating income for the quarter was $196.6 million or 24.9% of net revenue compared with $166.3 million or 23.6% of net revenue in Q4 2015 or an increase of 130 basis points in operating margin. The effective tax rate was 31.1% compared to 29.8% a year ago, which includes certain tax and related interest adjustments associated with the finalization of the company's transfer pricing arrangements and associated repatriation of foreign earnings. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would have been 30.6% compared to 29.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the quarter was $136.1 million or $0.99 per diluted share compared to net income of $117.4 million or $0.85 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the tax and related interest adjustments I just mentioned, EPS for the quarter was $1 per share. In addition, the negative net impact to earnings from foreign currency this quarter was $0.09 per share, $0.02 higher than what we previously estimated for Q4. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 137.2 million versus 138.2 million a year ago. There were a minimal amount of shares repurchased during the quarter under our recently approved $100 million authorization.  Capital expenditures were $43.3 million for the quarter compared to $35.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.  Turning to the highlights for our full fiscal year 2016 performance. Net revenue was $2.344 billion, up 14% on both a reported and constant currency basis, which reflects a 7% constant currency comparable sales growth. E-commerce sales totaled $453.3 million or 19.3% of total sales. Gross profit was $1.2 billion or 51.2% of net revenue compared to $997 million or 48.4% of net revenue in fiscal 2015, reflecting an increase of 280 basis points.  Net income for the year was $303.4 million or $2.21 per diluted share compared to $266 million or $1.89 per diluted share for fiscal 2015. This is based on an effective tax rate of 28.2% in 2016 versus 27.8% effective tax rate in 2015. Normalized for transfer pricing and repatriation tax adjustments, our adjusted EPS was $2.14 for fiscal year 2016 compared to $1.86 in 2015. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the year with $734.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $298.4 million or 5.1% higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a 5.7% decrease in inventory per square foot. This was slightly lower than expected due to the timing of in-transit inventory. As we head into 2017, we expect our inventory growth going forward to normalize and be more in line with our forward sales trend. Turning now to the details of our Q1 and fiscal year 2017 outlook. As Laurent mentioned, we've seen a slow start to the first quarter. Soft traffic in stores combined with lower conversion on our e-commerce site have weighed on our trend so far this quarter. Within our stores, we've seen conversion. AUR and UPT all remained solid, with traffic as the primary headwind. Despite this difficult trend, we are excited to launch a number of guest acquisitions and retention programs beginning this week and ramping into Q2. These programs leverage all parts of our business model and include the following : the launch of our Fast And Free Nulux collection, as Laurent mentioned, this week, leveraging our fast-turn capabilities to deliver color in selected styles to land in our stores next week and the expansion of our successful omnichannel strategies such as the ramping of our ship-from-store program from 85 to 145 stores by the end of Q2; the addition of our outlet stores to the ship-from-store program beginning in the first quarter; the introduction of a pilot of our buy online, pick up in-store capability beginning in Q2.  Within e-commerce, the online conversion trend has also been a particular focus, and we've taken aggressive actions to improve site performance, which I'm sure many of you have noticed. Our initial reads indicate that these efforts are gaining traction. That said, we expect revenues in Q1 to be in the range of $510 million to $515 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage decrease in the low single digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the first quarter of 2016 and assumes a Canadian dollar at $0.76 to the U.S. dollar and 10% more square footage versus Q1 last year.  We are seeing the product margin improvements we achieved in the second half of 2016 extend now into the first quarter of 2017 in a similar order of magnitude. However, these improvements are being offset significantly by deleverage on product and supply chain overhead and occupancy and depreciation expense due to the sales trend in Q1 sitting below our expectations. As a result, we now anticipate gross margin in the first quarter to increase by approximately 50 basis points versus Q1 2016. We expect SG&A in the first quarter to delever approximately 100 to 150 basis points, a function of our negative low single-digit comp assumption for the quarter. Assuming a tax rate of 31.2% and 137.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share versus $0.30 per share a year ago.  For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase of low single digits. This full year guidance reflects our view of strengthening trends in both e-commerce and stores as a result of the strategies we've mentioned around product assortment improvements, website enhancements and acceleration of our omnichannel model, and we are starting to see evidence of these strategies now materializing. We expect to open up to 50 company-operated stores, which includes an acceleration in our international store openings to 15. This represents a square footage increase of approximately 12% for the year.  We expect gross margin for the year to be flat versus 2016. The benefits from the product margin improvements that we have been seeing will have the most meaningful impact in the first half of the year and then moderate into the second half of 2017. Offsetting this is a modest level of deleverage in product and supply chain SG&A and in occupancy and depreciation, primarily due to the accelerated international store openings which carry a higher occupancy rate. We also expect full year SG&A rate to be flat versus 2016. We expect deleverage in the first half of the year, with an improved SG&A picture in the second half. As a result, we expect operating margin to be relatively flat with last year at 18%. We expect our fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.36 per share. This is based on 137.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which does not reflect an estimate of shares repurchased after Q4 2016 and also assumes an effective tax rate of 31.2%. We expect capital expenditures to range between $170 million and $175 million for the fiscal year 2017, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT and supply chain capital investments.  As we've mentioned on prior calls, operational excellence has been a priority to enable our growth strategies and recover our profitability. As we look forward to 2017, our agenda for operational excellence focuses on 3 areas. First, we will continue to develop our supply chain capabilities, building on the success we have seen over the last 2 years. This focus will not only enable us to maintain and extend our product margin recovery, but also help us strengthen our chase capabilities and provide shortened lead times in responding to market trends. An example of this currently includes our ability to accelerate color in key styles into our assortment to impact the first half of this year.  Our second operational priority focuses on SG&A and our current plan to deliver leverage on sales growth for 2017 and beyond. Earlier in Q4, we retained BCG to support us in a strategic effort to evaluate our cost structure and identify opportunities for cost efficiencies. We are now on the final stages of this work, which will help us become a leaner business and deliver operating results with less resource requirements. This work will enable us to reinvest a portion of these savings to support our growth strategies and also deliver the leverage in expenses for the balance of the year that our guidance contemplates. And lastly, our third operational priority is our IT infrastructure. We are deep into a number of projects that will support key operational capabilities for this year and beyond, in areas including : planning and allocation to build new abilities to flow inventory to better meet demand; e-commerce through enhancements to our website and mobile guest interfaces; and CRM to support our new loyalty programs as well as various elements of our guest engagement strategies.  In closing, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in the tenets of our long-range plan as we previously articulated them : revenues of $4 billion by 2020; gross margins in the low 50s; earnings growing faster than sales; EBIT margins in the low 20s. We see the results of 2016 as evidence of our progress against these goals. And we remain bullish for 2017 despite the slow start we've seen early in Q1, especially given that our most important growth drivers for the year are still in front of us and reflect exciting new elements of our business model, including the new product introductions we mentioned with Nulux in Q1; bra innovation in Q2; and jackets and outerwear as well as accessories into the second half; the e-commerce enhancements noted earlier such as the mobile app in Q2, visual merchandising improvements both on our websites and in stores; new guest acquisition strategies with our brand campaign launch in Q2; and our expanded CRM programs in the third quarter; the acceleration of our expansion in China; and finally, our men's initiatives ramping throughout the year. And we will accomplish all of this while building important new cost efficiencies through the strategic SG&A project that I mentioned.  We look forward to updating you on our progress on these programs and more over the course of the year. With that, I will open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So on same-store sales, I guess what have you seen from traffic and AUR so far in the first quarter versus what you saw in the fourth quarter? And I guess just how best should we think about comps you're expecting in the second quarter versus the second half? I'm just trying to gauge the improvement that you are embedding as we move out of the first quarter and your confidence level in that taking place. Stuart Haselden : Matt, it's Stuart. So on the comps in the first quarter, basically, as we were into the second -- into the final stages of the fourth quarter, we began to see conversion on our website soften. That trend has extended into the first quarter. We also saw store traffic soften in the early part of February. The other KPIs, particularly in the stores, remain solid. And in particular, AURs in stores remain strong. And so the headwinds that we're seeing in traffic really account for the softness in the store comp trends, and online, it's really related to conversion. So as Laurent mentioned, we're focused on addressing, in particular, the e-commerce softness through the assortment, through the color gaps that we saw on the assortment as well as how the visual merchandising on the site had opportunities for improvement. So we've been in aggressive actions on those points, and we're pleased to see positive results in the early days since we've made those changes. Beyond that, I think as we think about the Q1 comp, the guidance reflects just the quarter-to-date results and a measured outlook for April. We see more upside as we think about the balance of the year. And really, the guidance that we issued for the full year contemplates a degree of improvement across stores and e-commerce. That said, the improvement is more weighted to e-commerce. Many of the initiatives that we mentioned will benefit e-commerce disproportionately, specifically the site merchandising that I mentioned, also the mobile app launch in the second quarter, the omnichannel strategy as well, specifically ship-from-store, which has been a very successful initiative for us in 2016. We're expanding that, as I mentioned, significantly. And we'll have that expansion ramping through Q2 and benefit from that for the balance of the year. And also, there's just the broader macro trends that I think we're seeing across the industry, with consumers and our guests, in particular, shifting their shopping preferences to digital versus brick-and-mortar. So in terms of the store side of the equation, we've taken a sober view on our store outlook given the traffic trends. It's safe to say that our guidance does not reflect the same store comp performance that we saw in 2016. That said, we have a number of strategic sales-driving investments that will ramp over the course of the year that will benefit our stores and our website business in Q1. And in particular, February and March really did not benefit from all the initiatives that we've been talking about. And what we're -- and specifically, and we enumerated most of these on the -- in the prepared remarks, the product introductions are very important. The Nulux styles that landed this week have now risen to be our top sellers in both women's pants and crops. So we're excited to see the traction with Nulux. The bra innovation that we'll introduce in the second quarter, we believe, is also incredibly exciting and will -- can move our business. Jackets and outerwear, big businesses for us in the second half. We've had teams working to develop exciting new styles for that part of the business for the second half. And then also, as Laurent described, the brand campaign in the second quarter, we've never done -- had a strategy like that, so we're really excited to see how that can move our business as well. CRM in the third quarter and the expansion of our co-located strategies, which has proven exceptionally successful, we're ramping that into the second quarter. We see upside potentially for those -- for that strategy into the second half of the year as well. And the acceleration of China, so exciting comp trends in China. We've -- we're excited to see the number of stores opening there, increasing with more potential beyond that. So let me pause and see if Laurent would add anything. Laurent Potdevin : Well, Matt, I think that -- thanks, Stuart. Matt, I think what the performance that we've seen in Q4 was driven by the neutral and the jewel tones that were perfect for the gift-giving season and especially Q3, Q4. I mean, in Q1, we should have been bolder with the color assortment. And from a visual merchandising, we didn't bring that powerfully to life. Now with that said, we added a lot of talent on the merchant side later in 2016, with a real focus on visual merchandising. So we actually saw this trend happening very early on in the quarter, and with the much stronger supply chain, we've been able to react very quickly. So you're going to see more color showing up this next week actually. And we've actually added a lot of creative resources, both in Vancouver and in L.A., our ability to bring visual merchandising to life in a much more powerful way. So if you look at some of our products, which I'm sure some of you guys may have seen, whether it's the Loud & Clear Jacket or whether it's the Cool Racerback in hydrangea blue. When we've actually brought that to life in a way that we're proud of, showing fluidity and movement, the performance in sales has drastically increased. So disappointed with the beginning of Q1, and with that said, we own it. And by owning it, we also mean that we know how to fix it. And we've have seen very quick results in how we've been fixing it. So we know what to do. We're doing it. It's actually paying off. It's being validated in both traffic and conversion. And as Stuart said, I mean, I am more excited about 2017 than I've been since being around in 2014. I mean, we've got an unprecedented amount of product innovation and global brand activation that's ahead of us for '17 that will definitely drive traffic and conversion. So we're going to continue -- 2017 will be our best year ever, with earnings continuing to grow in line with sales. Matthew Boss : Great. And there's just one follow-up on the margin front. On gross margin, what's -- Stuart, what's the embedded product merchandise margin for -- in the first quarter and for the year? I'm just curious, what comp do you need to leverage the rod? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Matt, as I had indicated on the -- in the prepared remarks, we're seeing product margins recovering as expected in the first quarter. And to put a number to it, we're seeing product margins improving over 300 basis points in the first quarter, and we'd expect a similar trend into the second quarter. Unfortunately, the deleverage on our fixed cost components of gross margin is offsetting that to a greater degree than we expected as a result of the sales trend. And notably, we have 39 net new stores in Q1, which we didn't have last year, and the occupancy costs related to that is also weighing on that leverage point. So what we've said is that we will leverage our cost in the mid-teens total revenue growth rate. We're obviously falling short of that in the first quarter. We're happy with the product margin results overall. And I think the strategic cost reduction improvements that we've mentioned will benefit not only the SG&A line, but also the -- there's certain elements within the buying cost in gross margin that it will also benefit. So from a long-term basis, I still see us leveraging the cost structure at the mid-teens total revenue level. We'll probably do a little better than that in 2017 as a result of the expense initiatives we have underway. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: My question is -- Stuart, you mentioned something about the brand campaign. So I was wondering if you could talk more about that, the investment in that. Is that global? And then can you also talk about the investment as you build in multiple continents? What's the infrastructure investment? And what can it support outside of North America? Laurent Potdevin : Adrienne, this is Laurent. From a brand campaign standpoint, you've heard us, I mean, I think we're best in the world at grassroot initiatives, building communities and being [ pulled ] in those communities. And that's why we've been so successful with our physical footprint. Where we haven't always been as strong is really amplifying our voice, who we are as a brand, what lululemon stands for in the world. And as we grow the global brand, I mean, it's becoming increasingly important. So we've actually partnered with an amazing creative agency that's one of the world's leaders in editing and building content for millennials, and I'm not going to share today who it is, but we're very excited about the partnership to actually add the level of amplification that we need to really sort of share our voice. So it is a global launch. It will be focused on a number of key cities. It will be more focused on a couple of key cities around the world, and it will come to life mid-May. But it will be a very important moment in not only increasing our guest retention, but when you think about 2017 really being a year of bringing more eyeballs on the brand, guest acquisitions, I'm getting really excited about our ability in a really relevant, nimble way to put millions of eyeballs on the brand and therefore increase our collective. So it is a really exciting project, and I can't wait for -- I can't wait to share it with all of you. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Laurent, is it traditional media? And can you give a -- is it marketing dollars that are being reallocated? Or is it new investment in marketing dollars? Laurent Potdevin : It is. There is some element of incremental, and I wouldn't want you to think about it in terms of traditional. I mean, think about distributing that content in a really powerful way, but in a way that millennials are best at absorbing that content. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Fantastic. We'll be looking forward. And then the infrastructure? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Adrienne. It's Stuart. So the infrastructure priorities that we have globally are certainly to enable the expansion in Europe and Asia. We're seeing the fastest growth right now in Asia, and particularly in China. There is a lot of energy right now in building out the team and the infrastructure in China to enable the store opening pace that we'd like to see. I was in Hong Kong a few weeks ago with the team, evaluating how we can accelerate our market entry plans from a -- on a cross-functional basis. So we're aggressively recruiting the team to lead those efforts in the region, and we're excited with the momentum that we're seeing in China specifically. The team in Europe is being built out as well. We have a new GM, Gareth Pope, in Europe, who's helping us set the vision. So I'm sure there will be more to talk about in the future as Gareth develops that's strategy. But yes, it's definitely a big part of the -- of our long-term vision and that infrastructure is important to enabling it. Laurent Potdevin : Adrienne, maybe one more point on the brand campaign and the incremental investment. I mean, given the nature of how we're going to be distributing that content, we're going to have the ability to be very flexible in how we invest. So we'll see the reach of what we're doing by region, by segment, by channel, and so it's not -- we'll be very nimble in how we invest based on the region that we're seeing. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: So will you give us a heads-up on when that's being launched? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, we will. We're going to talk to you soon. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets. Brian Tunick : I guess on the 2017 comp guidance, maybe first, can you maybe give us some sense of how much an increase in ticket or AUR you're assuming in the business? Particularly on the bottoms side, are you assuming that bottoms have a similar year to 2016? And then maybe, Stuart, on the supply chain and calendar work, what inning are you in now relative to making some of these product changes. That sounds like Laurent's unhappy with what's in the stores right now on the color side and Lee's work as well? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Brian. On the guidance, as we think about the KPIs, we're seeing strong results in AUR. And our expectations were that AURs would moderate into 2017 as we begin to lap some of the really strong I&Es that we saw in 2016. I think we see more opportunity on the conversion side. As the product strategies and the product innovation lands, we'd be able to convert at an improved level both in stores and online. And I would say there's important traffic drivers as well between the brand campaign that Laurent just mentioned, improvements in our digital marketing strategies, the various CRM engagement enhancements that we have planned for the year, those will all drive traffic across both channels. But we're not relying on at least in how we've modeled the year, improvements in AUR to drive the comp. In fact, we expect to see AURs moderate. So I think that's how we're thinking about the comp from a KPI standpoint. And the -- on the supply chain work, we're really pleased with how that's proceeding. Ted Dagnese, our head of supply chain, has done a nice job of building out the team and continuing to take that agenda forward. And the partnership that we have with our suppliers is critical to that. We are continuing to now build on the success, as we mentioned, on -- in '16. The margin architecture that we landed is certainly a part of how we will manage the business and take it forward. We're turning our attention now to how to extend our supply chain capabilities to shorten lead times, to make us more agile, to identify how we can expedite product to market more quickly in response to market trends. And a number of our suppliers have had success with a number of other companies as well with that model that we're looking to learn from. So excited on the developments, see even more potential, even to gain efficiencies as our segmentation strategy within our supply chain continues to ramp. So a lot of upside as we think about supply chain and how it supports the business going forward. Laurent Potdevin : And Brian, to be clear, I mean, I'm not disappointed with product by any means. I think that our stores look better than they ever have, and I think that our vision for product is right on point where it should be. I mean, what we should have done in Q1 is be bolder with our color assortments, which would have been driving traffic and conversion and which would have lifted actually the entire range of product, including the more neutral tones. So I just wanted to clarify that. I'm really, really proud about where we are, where we're headed, especially when you think about innovation in categories. And that's actually being translated really strongly in our anchor categories for both men's and women's, with bottoms and bras, and with our technical products on the men's side. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Stuart, I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail. So you mentioned the quarter-to-date soft traffic in stores as well as softer conversion online. Can you maybe just help us out in terms of what's embedded in your down low single-digit comp guide for Q1 from both the stores channel and the e-comm channel? I'm just trying to understand where -- is pressure coming on both channels equally, or is it more one side of the other? Stuart Haselden : Ike, so I think versus our expectations, the e-comm channel has been softer than stores. The -- and I think as the guidance -- I know the guidance that we have given reflects a stronger recovery in trend in e-commerce versus stores, and it's related to all of the things that we described earlier that are sort of disproportionately expected to benefit our e-commerce business. The store business has been tougher, but not to the same degree as we've seen e-commerce. And maybe I'll invite Celeste to offer some commentary there. Celeste Burgoyne : Yes, thanks, Stuart. Yes, I mean, we've definitely seen a bit of traffic deceleration in Q1 from Q4, but overall, I'm definitely still happy with where we are. Regionally, we're seeing more impact in Canada versus the U.S. And in Canada, more impact in Alberta due to the resource sector. Overall, AUR, UPT and conversion are all holding strong in the store opportunity. And really, what we're focused on from a store perspective and really an omnichannel perspective is focusing on acquisition and retention and really being able to be agile and move to where the traffic is versus sitting still and waiting for traffic to come to us. So as we've spoken about with our real estate strategy, co-located and local both continue to be something that we see as really exciting opportunities from 2016 and into 2017 in areas we're focusing really hard on. And they both allow us to really capture traffic in the most relevant ways for those communities, co-located, expanding our square footage, for example, Mall Of America and Somerset, 2 key West co-located stores in 2016. We've driven more traffic in those locations and have grown the men's business, in particular, from 50% to 70% through more dedicated square footage. And then locals has also allowed us to go into smaller communities in a really locally relevant way. And the results have been something we're really proud of. Bend, Oregon and Fort Collins also, for example, have been 2 of the 4 that we're really excited about, and we'll continue to really push into that strategy into 2017. Irwin Boruchow : Just as a follow-up, I was just trying to find out, are you guiding both channels to be down? Or is one channel up versus the other? That's the specific question I'm trying to get at. Stuart Haselden : Yes, we didn't break it out. But I think it's safe to say the e-commerce channel is still up, just not to the degree that we expect it would be. And we're seeing more pressure on the comp in stores in terms of an absolute number. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Just to dig a little bit deeper on the 1Q. Stuart, can you maybe talk about February specifically versus March? I'm not sure if you could get into that detail, but it might help understand just the progression of what you've seen so far. Also, is the issue just as much in the men's assortment as women's? And then just separately, any way to quantify the level of newness you expect in F'17 versus '16? Not sure if you can break out what percentage of sales was driven by new product introductions in '16. What do you expect that to be in '17? Stuart Haselden : Okay, Paul. I'll try to cover as much of that as I can. I think to offer some of color on how Q1 has been shaping up, as I've mentioned, we saw a deceleration in e-commerce related to conversion that began in the last couple of weeks of January that's persisted into the early part of Q1, February and March. We saw it on the store side. Traffic headwinds become tougher early in February. So I wouldn't draw a distinction between February and the early weeks of March. I think what we're -- as we think about the guidance that we gave, the distinction we are drawing is we're expecting some measured improvements into April related to some of the things we've talked about. The Nulux program that's landed in stores this week, it's having a very strong guest response as well as the -- some of the chase activities that we mentioned that will begin to land next week. So February and March have not had the benefit of those particular activities or efforts. And then beyond April, into the balance of the year, there's just a number of things that we're focused on with major investments behind them that will help drive the different parts of the business that we've already talked about. From a product category standpoint, we've seen strength in bottoms across men's and women's. We've seen jackets and outerwear that had been a challenging category for us in the fourth quarter, and we've seen that continue into Q1. I don't know if Laurent or Celeste would add anything from a product standpoint. Laurent Potdevin : Yes, Paul, it's difficult to quantify newness. What I can say is that in '17, you'll see more newness both from a design standpoint and from a function standpoint. So when you think about launching a new fabric like Nulux, I mean, like the response has been tremendous. I mean, I think our tights' already #1 selling tights since the launch. So I mean, it really speaks for how well our new fabrics resonant with our guests. But also from a design standpoint, we've caught on in print. I mean, we've got a lot coming up. And when you think about the bra category that's already been performing strongly, we're going to have this really bold launch after a field of R&D and product testing with our athletes. So 2017 is -- the pipeline, and we've been talking about for the past years about sort of filling up the pipeline of innovation, and 2017 is really the year where both from a design and from a functional standpoint, we're going to see this pipeline really delivering the values to our guests that we have been waiting for. Operator : This concludes the time allocated for questions on today's call. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Okay. Thanks so much, everyone, for dialing in. We'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. On our year-end call, we reviewed our longer-term vision and 2020 plan to double our revenue to $4 billion and more than double earnings. Today, I will focus specifically on our first quarter business trends, which were positively impacted by the actions we took to build momentum early in the quarter. I will then touch on Q2 milestones that inspired our guests, from our first global brand amplification to our most innovative and integrated product launch to date. Stuart will review our financials and provide Q2 and full year guidance. We'll then take your questions.  Let me kick off the call by sharing our first ever global brand campaign, This Is Yoga. Through recontextualizing how the world sees yoga culture, we articulate the core of our brand and what defines and differentiates lululemon. The internal launch created an unprecedented energy and excitement across our employees, our educators and our ambassadors. And on May 15, we took yoga off the mat and into real life, sharing the power of practice with the world, reconnecting loyal guests with who we are and authentically reaching millions of new guests. We are proud of how powerfully this campaign has resonated with influential audiences around the world, creating 240 million global impressions and over 26 million views of the anthem video in its first 2 weeks.  The launch of This Is Yoga is just the beginning of our global brand amplification as we connect with millions of new guests in key markets around the globe. Before sharing our first quarter highlights, I'll update you on our decision to evolve ivivva to an e-commerce focused strategy. This new streamlined model, with 8 stores in key ivivva communities across North America, will enable us to continue serving our young ivivva guests who have come to know and love the brand so much. This decision will also be accretive to productivity, comps and earnings.  By August 20 of this year, we will close all but 8 of our ivivva locations, and Stuart will walk you through the financial impact for the year. While I know this is the best path forward for the future of our business, it's a very difficult decision due to its impact on our people, who we are deeply committed to supporting with integrity and compassion throughout this transition. I am so grateful for the passion and dedication of our people, the brand they've created and the impact ivivva will continue to have on so many communities of active girls. I'll now shift to our Q1 results. We delivered revenue of $520 million, a normalized gross margin increase of 210 basis points and an adjusted EPS of $0.32. Our adjusted EPS was better than our guidance and increased 7% over last year. Comps declined 1% in total with stores down 1% and e-commerce flat. Our normalized EPS exceeded our expectations, driven predominantly by stronger revenue and product margins as we continue to benefit from the evolution of our supply chain.  Our inventory remains well controlled, up 6% at the end of Q1 and in line with our sales growth. The actions we've taken to build momentum have had an immediate impact on our performance. This positive trend has continued and accelerated as we enter Q2. And as we look to the second quarter, we are seeing robust performance across all channels and categories with combined comps up in the low to mid-single digit and digital back to a double-digit comp trend. Turning now to some specific first quarter highlights. Let me share how the strategies we outlined on our last call have powerfully and positively driven our performance. Starting with women's. Our stronger assortment, combined with newness and functional innovation delivered a significant comp improvement. Towards the end of the first quarter, the cadence of new product launches and fabric innovation created excitement with guests and deepened our connection with the runners in our collective. Created in our new top performing Nulux fabric, Fast And Free brought our Naked Sensation across an extended range, including a tight, a crop and a bra. Guest response to Nulux overall continues to surpass our expectations and contributes significantly to our overall women's bottoms comp in Q1. And I am thrilled to share that together with new elite ambassador, Kerri Walsh Jennings, the 3-time Olympic Gold beach volleyball player and a truly inspirational role model both on and off the court, we launched our Mind Over Miles capsule. Featured in white, this collection was designed for guests who prefer [ a hugged in ] sensation, and was one of the top 5 selling style colors of this quarter. This collection is catered to our guests' growing demand for our Engineered Sensations across all product categories. Shifting to digital. Since April 1, we've doubled down on our digital strategies and our teams have been laser-focused on delivering a significantly enhanced digital experience. As I'm sure you've all noticed, the infusion of energy, movement and fun in how we've brought product to life, has exceptionally enhanced our guest experience and delivered an increased engagement and performance. Having just passed 2 million subscribers, the new creative approach has created our highest ever engagement across men's and women's, and delivered increased conversion. The clear and decisive actions we've made to inspire our guests and drive our digital performance is a compelling validation of the global runway ahead of us. Looking at men's. We delivered a high single-digit comp this quarter against an exceptional 21% comparison last year. Bottoms, often our male guest's entry to brand, remains a pillar of this business, comping up 20% in Q1. Our performance in men's tops accelerated as the quarter progressed, driven by the successful launch of the Somatic series training tops in our Intersec Fabric. This acceleration has contributed to an overall improvement in the men's comp, trending in the low double-digits. In Q2, key innovation launches, including light Metal Vent Tech Surge and pack and dash run tops will extend 2 of our top-performing franchises as we continue to solve for guests' functional demand.  Quarter-after-quarter, our performance gets us closer to realizing the full scale of our $1 billion plus opportunity in men's. While men account for 20% of our total business, they are just under 30% of all new guests. This will only increase as we strategically focus on guest acquisition through colocated stores, curated e-commerce experiences and by leveraging This is Yoga, where ambassadors like Jian Pablico and his practice of nonviolence, and London grime artist P Money and his practice of breath authentically connect with the broader millennial male audience.  Now turning to international, another exciting growth strategy and $1 billion dollar opportunity. In response to market demand, we are accelerating our expansion with 50 new store openings this year. Near-term, Asia holds the most significant growth potential. Building on the energy of our Harajuku location, we've seen exceptional performance at our new store within the stunning new Ginza Six complex in Tokyo. The guest response to our exclusive Tokyo white-on-white reflective capsule reflects the strong guest affinity of the brand in one of the most influential markets in the world. Building on the brand's performance and resonance in China, we are accelerating our densification strategy in Tier  1 cities, with the newest opening in Xintiandi, Shanghai, a vibrant iconic neighborhood destination for locals and visitors alike. In their first few months of opening, our China stores are outperforming all store metrics, currently tracking to over $1,600 in annual sales per square foot. Chinese millennials are some of the most digitally engaged consumers in the world, a behavior we are experiencing online with our Tmall business having doubled over the last 3 quarters.  The collective impact of our physical stores and digital presence is driving our impressive performance in this key market. In its second year and more than doubling in size, our Unroll China event sold out within hours. It kicked off May 6 at the Shanghai concert hall, with over 1,200 yogis experiencing the power of practice. Enhanced by live streaming, it's traveling across 6 cities with over 10,000 participants. Unroll China is a fantastic platform as we continue to build brand awareness across China. And our expansion this year continues across key cities, such as Chengdu and Guangzhou, as well as additional locations in Shanghai and Beijing.  Turning to Europe. London remains our key focus, delivering 50% sales growth on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Outside of London, we opened our second shop-in-shop in Dublin's Brown Thomas department store. Fueled by strong guest demand, the opening and performance has been exceptional, tracking at $1,600 per square foot. In North America, we continue to invest to realize the solid growth opportunities ahead of us, maximizing our potential through tailored and agile store format and leveraging our omnichannel tools that have greatly exceeded expectations with guests. We are driving double-digit square footage growth and on track to open 30 stores in key destination cities, including New York, where we are opening in an iconic space at 597 Fifth Avenue across from the Rockefeller Center as well as Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Boston.  While early into the second quarter, we are off to a great start with many exciting moments to come that will continue to drive our performance. With a clear mandate to accelerate momentum and drive growth, a highly collaborative and creative team is delivering quantifiable impact and is demonstrating what can quickly be achieved when we unite behind a shared vision.  And the results speak for themselves. In a short period of time, the team has delivered 2 new releases of our website, an enriched experience for iconic product launches such as our category disrupting Enlite Bra, bold and curated product experiences to align with This is Yoga campaign, and highly targeted and timely guest engagement such as our summer seasonal focus on women's shorts, which drove a 39% comp in the U.S.  Collectively, this work is meaningfully and sustainably impacting our performance. The scale of our potential in digital is crystal clear, and I've never felt more energized by our ability to realize a billion dollar plus opportunity in front of us. Last but not least, I want to focus on innovation. Starting with our newest whitespace launch, our category-defining bra, Enlite. Over 2 years in its creation, our industry disrupting research and development team created an innovative technology, enabling women to experience comfort, performance and aesthetics when selecting a run bra. Managing harmonious movement across the whole body, Enlite provides a freeing sensation, superior comfort and 0 distractions. Made from our proprietary Ultralu fabric in our signature barely there feeling, it provides optimal stretch, recovery and breathability. We are now at a [indiscernible] position in the bra category as we are in women's bottoms, delivering the most innovative and demanded product in the 2 categories that define the women's athletic market. Initial performance and reaction from our guests and educators has been exceptional, with Enlite receiving over 190 million media impressions, exceeding plan by 300% and instantly becoming our #1 selling bra. In just a few weeks, Enlite has created a significant halo across the category. And by balancing the overall assortment with a high support, molded fit option, our initial findings suggest that a significant number of guests choosing Enlite have not bought a bra from us before, creating the opportunity for the Enlite platform to improve our conversion by reaching a broader range of guests. In Q3, we will bring to market our newest fabric innovation, building on our unique leadership position in yarn development and raw material design. I know this newest addition to our Engineered Sensations range will create an even deeper connection with new and existing guests, who live for high sweat and high-intensity workouts.  Our whitespace team will continue to innovate the science of engineered sensation and the future of how people want to feel as they live a life they love. Before passing over to Stuart, I'd like to take a moment to share some great updates to our Board of Directors and executive team. First, a warm welcome to our new Co-Chairman, Glenn Murphy. I look forward to working with Glenn and know that his deep knowledge and experience will have a substantial impact on the future of the business. Next, I'm delighted to recognize Stuart Haselden, who is taking on the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. Since joining, he has led with clarity and confidence. And thanks to his work, we have the foundation and operational excellence in place to strive as we realize the significant growth opportunities ahead of us.  I'm also pleased to share that Sun Choe, our SVP, Merchandising, is now reporting directly to me. This ensures that our Creative Director, Lee Holman, and his team has the space to focus on design, while our merchants can effectively drive the design vision into profitable growth. We're happy to have Sun on the call with us today, so do feel free to direct questions her way also. As I look to our second quarter and the rest of 2017, I continue to see the unprecedented opportunity for lululemon. From our unique culture, our cadence of product innovation, designing the future of guest experiences, combined with This Is Yoga amplifying who we are globally, we are more powerfully positioned than ever to deliver long-term profitable growth as the leading global brand of an active, mindful lifestyle. Now, over to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. After a slow start to Q1, we saw business accelerate in the latter part of the quarter and we're pleased to see this trend now extending into Q2, with an even more pronounced improvement in the e-commerce trend that I'll discuss shortly. We also saw strong product margin performance in Q1 that exceeded prior estimates and enabled an earnings outcome well above our guidance. This reflects the ongoing benefits of our supply chain investments. Before reviewing the details of the first quarter, I'd like to offer some commentary on the impact of our decision to close our ivivva stores. I'll then review the details of our first quarter results and provide our updated outlook for the full year 2017 and also the second quarter. As Laurent mentioned, we plan to reposition ivivva as a primarily e-commerce focused business, with a select number of stores continuing to operate in key communities across North America. We plan to close approximately 40 of our 55 ivivva branded stores and expect to convert about half of the remaining locations to lululemon stores.  We'll also close our 16 ivivva branded showrooms and other temporary locations, and will streamline its dedicated support infrastructure. The store closures and restructuring will be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In connection with this restructuring plan, we expect to recognize pretax costs of between $50 million and $60 million in fiscal 2017, of which $17.7 million was recognized in Q1. The costs are composed primarily of asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, lease termination costs and a smaller portion for inventory provisions and severance.  Now turning to the details of Q1. Total net revenue rose 5% to $520.3 million, with the increase in revenue resulting from the following : an increase in square footage growth of 10% versus last year, driven by the addition of 38 net new company operated stores since Q1 of 2016, 22 net new stores in the U.S., 3 stores in Canada, 5 in Europe and 8 in Asia. This was offset by a total constant dollar comparable sales decline of 1%, comprised of a bricks-and-mortar comp store sales decline of 1% and an e-commerce comp that was flat. The impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $1.5 million or 0.3%. During the first quarter, we opened 5 net new company operated stores, 2 in the U.S., 2 in Asia and 1 in Europe. We ended the quarter with 411 total stores versus 373 a year ago and 352 stores in our comp base : 57 of those in Canada, 258 in the U.S, 26 in Australia and New Zealand, 7 in Europe and 4 in Asia.  At the end of Q1, we also had a total of 48 showrooms in operation, 30 in North America and 18 internationally. Revenues from company operated stores totaled $379.1 million or 72.9% of total revenue compared to $358.7 million in the first quarter of 2016 or 72.4% of total revenue. Revenues from our digital channel totaled $97.2 million or 18.7% of total revenue compared to 19.7% of total revenue in the first quarter of last year. Other revenue, which includes outlets, showrooms, strategic sales, pop-up stores and warehouse sales totaled $44 million versus $39.2 million in the first quarter of last year. Gross profit for the first quarter was $256.9 million or 49.4% of net revenue compared to $239.1 million or 48.3% of net revenue in Q1 2016.  The gross profit rate in Q1 was adversely impacted by 100 basis points related to ivivva inventory provisions. Excluding these items, adjusted gross margin increased 210 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter with the increase comprised of the following : 380 basis points of overall product margin improvement, primarily driven by lower FOB costs, higher average unit retails and a modest benefit in air freight, an extension of our strategic supply chain efforts that we've seen driving margin improvement over the last several quarters; foreign-exchange contributed to a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement in gross margin. Offsetting these factors was 200 basis points of deleverage, half attributable to occupancy and depreciation and the other half to fixed costs related to our product and supply chain team. SG&A expenses were $199.1 million or 38.3% of net revenue compared to $181.5 million or 36.6% of net revenue for the same period last year. The deleverage in SG&A was generally in line with our expectations and due to increases in store operating cost, digital marketing, investments in brand and community and IT, partially offset by a benefit in foreign exchange relative to last year.  Separately, as a result of our plans for the ivivva business, we incurred $12.3 million in asset impairment and restructuring costs associated with the write-off of capital assets and severance. Operating income for the quarter was $45.4 million or 8.7% of net revenue compared with $57.6 million or 11.6% of net revenue in Q1 2016. Excluding the pretax charges of $17.7 million related to the planned closures of the ivivva stores, adjusted operating income for the quarter increased to $63.2 million, reflecting 50 basis points of operating margin expansion versus last year to 12.1% of sales. Tax expense for the quarter was $15.1 million or 32.6% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 20.6% a year ago. Keep in mind, the prior year tax rate includes certain adjustments for the company's transfer pricing arrangement and associated repatriation of foreign earnings. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.8% compared to the 29.8% in the first quarter of 2016.  Net income for the quarter was $31.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.33 for the first quarter of 2016. Net income in Q1 2017 includes $13.1 million or $0.09 per share in ivivva-related charges. Excluding these charges, adjusted net income in the quarter was $44.3 million or $0.32 per share or an increase of 7% to an adjusted EPS of $0.30 last year.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were $137.2 million versus $137.5 million a year ago, which takes into account the weighted impact of 234,000 shares repurchased during the quarter at an average price of $54.60 per share. By the end of the quarter, we had completed a total of $12.8 million in total share repurchases under the current $100 million authorization, which was the maximum available for repurchase under our existing 10b5-1 program. Capital expenditures were $19.9 million for the quarter compared to $26.6 million in the first quarter of last year. The reduction relates primarily to fewer store openings as our store opening cadence this year is weighted more heavily to the back half. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $698.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $304 million or 6% higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2016, reflecting a 3% decrease in inventory per square foot. We expect our inventory growth at the end of Q2 and for the balance of the year to generally grow in line with our forward sales trend. Turning now to our updated outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2017. We are pleased with the results we are now seeing from our efforts to recover the sales trend in our e-commerce business. Quarter-to-date trends online are now comping in the positive low double digits and we see additional opportunity ahead. To deliver this important inflection in our digital business, we have taken aggressive steps to reorganize our digital teams and have leveraged certain external resources not previously contemplated in our financial plans. As a result, we will have certain onetime investments related to this recovery effort, which we will break out momentarily as part of our SG&A guidance. We're also pleased with the performance of our store teams in a difficult macro environment and we continue to see solid ongoing results. Please note that the guidance we are sharing excludes additional costs related to the ivivva restructuring.  For Q2, we expect revenues to be in the range of $565 million to $570 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low to mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2016 and reflects a low to mid-teens e-commerce comp estimate. This also assumes the Canadian dollar at 0.76 to the U.S. dollar and 8 new store openings in the quarter. We anticipate gross margin, normalized for ivivva, to increase approximately 100 basis points over Q2 of last year. This reflects strong product margin improvements partially offset by occupancy and depreciation trends similar to Q1. We expect SG&A in the second quarter to delever from Q2 2016 by approximately 350 basis points. This deleverage is greater than our original plans contemplated, with approximately half related to critical onetime expenditures to support our e-commerce business as we just discussed. These aggressive actions, encompassing site optimization, visual merchandising, improved social engagement and digital marketing in a short period of time have already made a significant impact, improving our digital comps from flat to low double-digits, and I am excited by the momentum this gives us for the balance of Q2 and the second half of the year. The remainder of the SG&A deleverage is related to brand and community investments associated with our new global brand campaign that we launched in May along with IT spend related to key technology projects. We expect foreign exchange to have a nominal impact to SG&A in Q2 based on actions taken to mitigate our exposures. Assuming a normalized tax rate of 31% and 137.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.35 versus $0.38 a year ago. It's important to note this includes approximately $0.04 to $0.05 of earnings impact from expense related to our digital acceleration work that I just mentioned. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.53 billion to $2.58 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low single-digits on a constant dollar basis. The guidance range takes into account the planned closures of our ivivva stores and the associated reduction in revenues, offset partially by the accelerating trends we are seeing take shape in the business and in particular, digital. We continue to expect to open up to 50 company-operated stores in 2017. This includes 15 or more internationally, and represents a square footage increase in the low double-digits. We expect normalized gross margin for the year to increase 50 to 100 basis points from 2016, reflecting the benefits of product margin improvements, primarily in Q1 and Q2 and moderating into the second half. We continue to expect deleverage in products and supply chain SG&A as well as occupancy and depreciation, primarily due to more store openings planned versus last year, including those higher occupancy international locations. We now expect SG&A for the full year to deleverage by approximately 50 to 100 basis points versus 2016. This includes the onetime digital-related investments, which I mentioned earlier, and accounts for approximately 50 basis points of the increase. In addition, we will continue to invest in brand and community activities, IT and our international business, notably to support our expansion efforts in Asia. As we complete our work in digital we expect the SG&A rate to moderate in the second half of the year and provide leverage in Q4. We now expect our normalized fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.38. This increase to our full year guidance reflects our confidence that the positive trends we're now seeing will extend for the full year. Our EPS guidance is based on 137.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and also assumes a normalized effective tax rate of 31%. We expect capital expenditures to range between $175 million and $180 million for the fiscal year 2017, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT investments. This is an increase versus our prior guidance of $170 million to $175 million due to increased investments to accelerate our digital business, plus additional capital related to new and remodeled stores. Before we take your questions, I wanted to emphasize the importance of the strategic measures we've taken to reorganize and strengthen our digital and technology capabilities. We have leveraged both internal and external resources in this effort to generate results quickly. These actions have carried costs that are impacting SG&A in the near-term, but we expect to realize meaningful SG&A leverage in Q4 as we clear these onetime investments. We are confident that these are the correct investments to make now to build our business for the long-term. We've also balanced these decisive near-term moves with thoughtful structural changes, including the recent announcements within our leadership team. I'm excited for my new role and the opportunity to work more closely with our technology teams. And I am thrilled to have Julie Averill joining us as our new CTO, leading all of our global IT functions. Julie has nearly 20 years of broad-based IT experience and was most recently Chief Information Officer at REI. I look forward to working with her to further build our technology infrastructure to achieve our growth plans. And with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Kate Fitzsimons : This is Kate on for Brian. Congrats on the quarter-to-date improvement. I guess just we were thinking about what actions, specifically, you took in Q1 that you think most directly impacted the comp trend just from a merchandise perspective. And then, I guess, with Sun in the room, I guess, when you're thinking about what changes you're making here in 2Q from a product perspective and into the back half, what do you see as the most meaningful opportunity in order to help continue the improved comp momentum? Laurent Potdevin : Thanks for your question. So the 2 most important actions we took was, one, is getting back with depth in the assortment that we had lacked earlier on in the quarter. And, two, was really, as we had articulated on the last call, really focusing on our digital experience. And I'm sure you've seen and I'm sure you've experienced it, but what we've been able to create in a very short period of time has actually brought to life -- or the brand to life in a way that is really, really powerful. And we've seen the highest engagement from our guests ever actually, whether it was a strap happy or the launch of the Enlite Bra or the campaign that we launched at that time. So I mean, I'll let Sun speak more, specifically to the assortment. But from an assortment and from a digital standpoint, I mean, we were incredibly focused. We articulated what we needed to do. We did it. And actually, the results exceeded our expectations. Sun Choe : And from the merchandising standpoint, I think 2 key things for us that really helped turn some of the trend around. The first thing was, we were quickly able to get back into color and print, so we do see that balance improving. And I think, given that we are a performance and functional brand, the fact that we had really strong launches in our Nulux fabric franchise, as well as the launch in our Enlite Bra, that really helped buoy the trend. And we know that we have a lot more of those innovation platforms and franchises in the pipeline for the future, so we remain optimistic. Kate Fitzsimons : Great. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on the Enlite Bra. Can you just speak to any pricing or branding learnings that came as you implemented that launch? Sounds like it's really bringing in some new customers to the brand. Sun Choe : Yes, we're really excited. It's our most expensive bra in our portfolio. We have seen 0 price resistance, so what we're finding is that if we have a technical solve and we're differentiated in the market, she's willing to pay the price. Operator : The next question's from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: My question is on the digital growth. First, on the gross margin. How should we think about the gross margin in that channel and the op margin, relative to brick-and-mortar? And then, Stuart, can you also talk about the inventory markdown, the $5.4 million? Was it all ivivva? Was it any go forward product? And is there any residual markdown in Q2 that we should expect? Stuart Haselden : Hey Adrienne, certainly. So on the profit profile of our digital business, and there is certainly disclosure that we provide in our Q. We enjoy a stronger operating margin with our e-commerce business. I mean, specifically, we did not have the rent and the payroll cost that we incur as part of our bricks-and-mortar business, and the product margins are slightly higher as well, as we have a more efficient way to manage our inventory pool online. So that is a benefit to the e-commerce business. And as we continue to have goals, to drive a higher proportion of our business through our e-commerce channels, that should have an accretive impact on our overall company operating margins. In terms of the inventory cost that we called out, and there is a [ wreck ] in the press release that addresses specifically the cost of the inventory provision we took related to the ivivva restructuring decision. That is entirely related to ivivva, and at this point, we do not expect further inventory provisions in the second quarter. We believe that should all fall within the first quarter disclosure. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So just a breakdown, the low to mid-single digit comps that you're seeing here in May, or that you saw in May. I guess how would you rank the sequential improvement by category, if we were to bridge the 400 basis point comp improvement versus the negative one in the first quarter? Stuart Haselden : Hey Matt, it's Stuart. Yes, I think that we're seeing strength out of the latter part of the first quarter into the second quarter, certainly in both channels. Versus our original expectations for Q1, we saw a really strong trend in stores in particular, in the latter part of Q1. We see that continuing into the first quarter. That's definitely part of the guidance that we gave. But importantly, and probably strategically, the work that we are in, in the digital acceleration effort has produced an important inflection in the trend of that business from the first quarter into the second quarter, which the quarter-to-date trend that we commented on in the prepared remarks reflect the impact that, that effort is having. We are very confident that those trends will continue. And as we mentioned, we see opportunity above the quarter-to-date trends. So that business being about 20% of the total, you can sort of back into how the relative impact on that comp guidance is shaking out, but we're really seeing strength across both channels. Matthew Boss : Got it. And then just a follow-up on SG&A, Stuart. Excluding the onetime items you laid out near-term, is it still fair to think about low single-digit comps as the multiyear SG&A hurdle rate? And then, I guess, if you could just touch on the strategic expense assessment, and what you found in Phase I and then just potential opportunities as we think about Phase II, which I think would be more next year opportunity? Stuart Haselden : So certainly, I think we've been pretty consistent that we expect to be able to leverage our cost structure at a low to mid-teens total revenue growth outcome. So the combination of the comp and the square footage growth are the factors that will help us achieve that. That's unchanged. We see that as the underlying fundamentals of how we have constructed the financial plan for this year and into next year. What's different, as we mentioned, is the onetime cost that we'll incur to recover our digital business. So that -- those fundamentals are not different. In terms of the, I think the second question was regarding the SG&A work that we had begun in the later part of last year. And that work we're benefiting from this year. We'll see, as we had mentioned on the prior call, we'll see that the full benefit of that work in the second half of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we expect it will be in a position to begin leveraging the top line estimates that we've offered. Operator : The next question's from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Great quarter. I actually wanted to focus a little bit on 2 questions. The first one is just, not to continue to talk about digital, but the digital change, there's been a lot of changes going on there. And I just want a high level, strategically, what specifically are you doing now that's having such a meaningful, immediate impact that you really didn't do before? And how to think about that in terms of one-time cost, Stuart? It would seem like maybe the onetime costs are consulting fees or something like that. How much of that is onetime? How much should we think about that as an ongoing cost, just to grow the business? Laurent Potdevin : Well Matt, if you go back a couple of years, I mean there was really no digital culture, no digital mindset at lululemon. And so we built this Center of Excellence with digital that really allowed us to put the tools, the platform, the foundation in place to really be able to build the global, scalable business that we knew we needed, including CRM, which didn't exist. We've done that over the past 2 years. We've got this outstanding foundation. And the last piece of the puzzle was really to bring the brand to life digitally in a way that's as powerful as in the stores. And when you think about our performance in the stores, it's all about human connections. We refer constantly about the educators being the most important role in the company, and so translating that online is difficult. So the focus over the past few months, now having the foundation in place has really been to bring the brand to life in a powerful way. And I think you can see that in the way the product is being shot, in the way we're talking about technology, and the way we're bringing video to life and maybe most importantly, in how we're linking social PR, our presence on mobile as well as on desktop. So that has had a very significant impact on the business. And it's really -- if you think about that Center of Excellence, we've built it. We've built the foundation. And the transition that we've been driven lately really brings all of the technology under Julie Averill, our new CTO, who will be reporting to Stuart, all the Digital Marketing, guest acquisition, driving traffic in our brand and community, which the timing is perfect with the launch of This Is Yoga. And then all visual merchandising with Sun. And finally, the operating part of running the channel under our leaders in the various regions with Celeste, Ken and Gareth, so that they can truly have a guest-centric vision to servicing our guests that is channel agnostic. Stuart Haselden : And Matt, just to follow on that and offer some details on the costs. A lot of the costs that we're incurring are related to getting results quickly. So there's a few buckets I would group them into. First is the technical, digital work related to our website. We identified a number of opportunities through the work that we started in the first quarter and are now continuing into the second quarter that were hard-core coding issues that we needed to tackle. And in order to do that quickly, we needed to bring in external resources so that we could have the critical mass, in terms of the expertise to do that in a quick manner. So that's a big part of those costs. Otherwise, you heard us speak about the creative content on the website, photography. We've engaged agencies to help us not only with the development of that creative content, but also in the photography itself. So the agency cost related to the photography and creative content are really the other pieces of the cost that we're incurring. The onetime in nature aspects and the way we've characterized it in that manner is that, again, we've asked these external resources to join us during this task force we've organized to help us drive change rapidly. And so, in order to do this under those time tables, that is what's giving rise to the additional costs that we're incurring outside of our normal business model. As we complete this work over the course of this summer and early part of Q3, we'll be able to transition and build on this work and take it forward as a new part of how we do business from a digital standpoint, and be able to better leverage and more normalize the cost profile. Laurent Potdevin : To add to Stuart's point. I mean, we've been -- we're very confident about doubling down on the investment because week after week, almost day after day, I mean we see the results in the business of the work that we're doing. So there is this real time feedback loop about the quality and the impact of the work that we're doing. Operator : The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : We have a question related to capabilities with digital and inventory management. What are your thoughts around how you feel about the bricks and clicks, in terms of the inventory in-store versus online? And Stuart, on the strategic supply chain efforts, could you just update us on what's ahead, in terms of opportunities there as you continue to make progress in both quality and speed? Those were our main questions. Thank you. Laurent Potdevin : Hey Oliver, this is Laurent. Quickly on the omnichannel, I mean, I think I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're actually really, really proud about the results of our omnichannel strategy. I mean, from the implementation of RFID to the ability to really maximize the use of inventory and obviously the margins that we deliver. I mean like the -- our mid-channel strategies are working incredibly well in -- both from a financial standpoint but also in servicing our guest. And we've got more of those coming online in the latter part of the year. And I'm spacing on the second part of your question... Stuart Haselden : Right, on the supply chain and some of the strategic, I guess, goals that we have there. Now that we're -- we've been happy with the results that we've seen in recovering our gross margins, and we believe we've established a more stable and reliable sourcing and supply chain organization. I think our next priorities turn to continuing to support our design teams from an innovation standpoint, so that we can enable the work they're doing from a sourcing standpoint, to bring to life meaningful innovation and designs that will matter to our guests and help us solve problems for athletes. In addition to that, I think importantly, we're continuing to look at ways for us to build flexibility into our supply chain, so that we can position raw materials in a way that we can respond to guest trends more rapidly. We saw some of the first examples of this late in the first quarter, where we were able to actually chase into certain styles where we saw gaps in color, and even introduce certain graphic styles that we hadn't done in a while so -- and with remarkable sell-through. So we're really pleased to see those initial wins, and those are -- that flexibility is something we're looking to expand. Laurent Potdevin : And from an organizational standpoint -- with Sun reporting to me from an organizational standpoint, I mean, we're going to create some healthy tension between merchandising and design, which will really allow us to sort of drive the design vision into profitable growth. Oliver Chen : Okay, and the last thing is on the product side. You've really made really great progress with Enlite and Nulux. Just how would you prioritize what are the bigger product opportunities? Or how would you prioritize for the back half between tops and bottoms, and outerwear and accessories could be an opportunity too. Just curious about how we should think about the catalysts relative to each other? Laurent Potdevin : Well you'll -- Oliver, you'll see it when it comes to life. So we're not going to tell you too much, too early. But one thing I can tell you, that we're obviously always focused on function first. And when we do that, it pays off tremendously, whether it's with Nulux or Enlite, I mean, we've got 2 incredible data points right there. So you're going to see a focus on functional when it comes to -- and that's really what makes us who we are. Operator : The next question's from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Mark Altschwager : Just a follow-up on the SG&A leverage discussion, and sorry to harp on it. The guidance for the year, I guess, really doesn't get you to that low to mid-teens revenue growth rate in the back half. Yet Stuart, I think you mentioned expecting meaningful SG&A leverage by Q4. And so I'm just trying to make sure I understand. I mean, as you get to Q4 would you expect to be at a point where you can leverage SG&A consistently on a go-forward basis? Or is the Q4 leverage on, call it a low double-digit revenue growth, more of an exception versus the rule? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Mark, it's a good question. I would say the way we built the model over the next 5 years and -- should enable us to deliver SG&A leverage in that top line growth range we mentioned, that low to mid-teens. I think in the fourth quarter, there's an opportunity to do better than that based on the work that we've done to improve our cost structure, coming out of the project that we had mentioned in the second half of last year. And we'll take those benefits forward. And the fourth quarter is our largest quarter from a sales standpoint, and a little bit more flexibility to, from a quarterly standpoint, to do -- to have leverage on our cost structure. Operator : The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : As you think about the ivivva business and the exiting of that business, what long-term margin and return improvements do you think can be expected? And then on another note, the improvement in color, is it where you want it to be yet? Or how should we see the product enhancements, whether it's on the color or whether it's the online conversion that changed in Q1, is there more runway to go? Stuart Haselden : So Dana, it's Stuart. I'll first respond to your question on ivivva, and then I'll let Sun respond your question on the color and the product, product strategy. In regards to ivivva, it was a very difficult decision in terms of the restructuring plan that we have announced, that came after much deliberation. As we look at the run rate of this business go forward, under the new structure that we have established, we expect the revenues to be a little less than half of what we saw last year. And it should be positioned to generate positive comps that will be accretive to the overall company comps, and it should also be positioned to generate a modest operating profit, where in all prior years we've operated ivivva, it's had a small operating loss. And as we mentioned, the restructuring and the store action should be largely completed by Q3. Sun Choe : And then going into color, I'd say we are happy with the improvement of the balance. We feel good in that we have a lot of white in the stores, which is seasonally, really appropriate, emphasizing light neutrals and some pops of color. I'd say that as we get into the back half of June and going into fall, we'll be even in a more ideal state. And as Stuart mentioned, we've just done a much better job partnering with the supply chain and making sure that we do have flexibility in our sourcing models. So always able to chase back into colors that sell out. And then, again, we feel very well-positioned from a portfolio standpoint, because we have a lot of key innovations in the pipeline for the back half of the year that's really focused on fabric, function and fit. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, can you talk about the promotional cadence in the business during the quarter? How that trended, how it's been in May to date? And also curious about store traffic, just what you saw, how did that progress during the last several months? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Paul. The promotional cadence has been healthy. We executed the warehouse sale, the physical warehouse sale in Dallas earlier this month to great success. It was a record for us that -- or approached, I should say, the record we had achieved previously with our Edmonton warehouse sale. The sales and AUR results from that event exceeded our plans. And I think it really speaks to not only the resilience of our clearance model, but also our full price business, given the level of interest and demand we saw in that warehouse sale. So otherwise, markdowns in stores and online are well managed, and I think our inventory position reflects that as well. So the markdown picture is very healthy and has been for much of Q1, and certainly now into Q2. Store traffic's an interesting story. It still remains a headwind for us. And that was a big part of the weakness that we saw early in Q1 that we spoke about on the last call. We have seen improvements in store traffic. And what's been interesting is, as we have executed on our Enlite launch, the Nulux Fast And Free launch and importantly, the This Is Yoga program or campaign rather, we have seen that these events have been able to move the needle in our store traffic as well as our online traffic. But what we've taken away from that is that it's actually possible for us to effect store traffic positively when we have compelling product and brand stories and events. So we're taking those learnings forward. We believe it creates interesting opportunity for us as we look forward. And as we think about KPIs generally, that improvement, sequential improvement in store traffic, still negative, still a headwind but sequentially better in the latter part of Q1 into the early part of Q2 is also being supported by improvements in conversion and UPTs in our stores, that is supplementing or complementing the continued strength in AURs. Ultimately, we need to see a balanced picture across all of our store KPIs to have a sustainable comp picture. So we've relied heavily on AUR up to this point, we still see strong AUR performance, but it's really important to see conversion, UPT and -- in a better place and also traffic improving. So thanks for your question on store traffic. Operator : The next question's from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I wanted to actually focus on the decision to accelerate the international openings, Asia versus Europe, and is it kind of more a fill-in of the existing kind of trade areas? Are you expanding into new trade areas and markets? And what are you seeing in those markets that's giving you the confidence to do -- to pull that lever and press on the gas at this point? Is it online demand that you're seeing? Or store level demand, or is it the showrooms, what you're learning from those? I think this is probably a pretty important part of the equation for you guys over the next few years. Laurent Potdevin : Thanks, Omar. I think it's all of the above. I mean, we're obviously seeing the opportunity and the scale of the opportunity in Asia, and we're seeing great momentum there. So whether it's our Tmall business doubling in less than 3 quarters, or whether it's store opening in the couple of -- first month at $1,600 a square foot, or the activity that we see on social or with the events that we're rolling out. I mean, that obviously gives us great confidence in our ability to accelerate our store openings in Asia, mostly in China. But it's also, honestly I mean, the ability to secure outstanding locations. So if you think about the store that we're about to open in Tokyo, within Ginza Six, or the locations that we've been able to open in Xintiandi in Shanghai, and in Beijing, I mean that obviously, we're not -- the pace of the openings is in no way jeopardizing the quality of the locations, that's what we think. So we see tremendous momentum in Asia, in Japan, in Hong Kong, in mainland China, as well as Singapore and Korea. And in Europe, we've grown 50% year-over-year, and it actually goes outside of London. I mean, you see the performance of Brown Thomas in Dublin, which really gives us -- which really validates the work that we're doing in Europe, and that fact that the halo effect that it has beyond London. Operator : The next question's Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Stuart, my question's on digital marketing investments, and can you just give us a little more color on the second quarter investments and why you would characterize them as onetime? Maybe if we understand a little bit better what those expenses are, we could get our heads around the onetime characterization. And then, secondarily, I would imagine that ivivva operates at a lower gross margin. So is there a permanent improvement in gross margin you expect to your business 1 to 2 years from the elimination of most of the ivivva business? Stuart Haselden : Okay. Okay, Kimberly. On the first question, the digital marketing investments, I would not include that as part of the onetime cost that we're referring to. What I am referring to are the technical design and development costs for the improvements to our website, that's one bucket. The second bucket is photography cost of outsourcing photography to a photography agency. And the third bucket is the brand creative content support that we have from an agency we've also selected to help us with that. And what I would say is, that what's creating much of the onetime nature of this, is the speed at which we're trying to accomplish these improvements and changes that we've identified we need to the website. There will be elements likely of the second and third buckets that we'll take forward, but not to the same order of magnitude that we're seeing right now, given just again, the time frame in which we're trying to accomplish these improvements. So hopefully, that clarifies it. The second question you had on ivivva, gross margin. Gross margins in ivivva are -- have not been as high as in lululemon. I think that's safe to say. By reducing the mix of the ivivva overall, yes, that creates some benefit to the overall weighted average, if you will, gross margin that we'll have. The ivivva business will be a viable business that we're -- we still believe in, albeit on a smaller scale, and we also have specific strategies and plans in place to improve the product margin of the ivivva business as we'll take it forward as primarily an e-commerce business. Operator : This concludes question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : All right. Thanks, everybody.

Our strong Q2 results reflect focused delivery against our key growth initiatives. The strategic pillars, including digital, international, men's and North America drove the improvement in our business as we progress towards realizing our 2020 vision to achieve $4 billion in revenue.  We've had some fantastic moments in Q2. We launched category-disrupting product innovation, such as the Enlite Bra; amplified and articulated the brand globally with This Is Yoga, reaching 50 million guests, equally split between men and women; and through powerful community activation, such as Unroll China, we connected directly with guests via live streaming our ambassador-led yoga class to over 150,000 people. As a result, we drove outperformance in Q2, delivering revenue of $581 million, a normalized gross margin of 51.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.39.  Our adjusted EPS exceeded our guidance and grew modestly versus last year despite planned digital investment spending. Our comp results were strong across channels and merchandise category. Our performance in Q2 and solid momentum we're seeing in early Q3 gives me great confidence in our strategy and long-term plan.  Today, I'll focus on the Q2 results and highlights of the quarter and share our plans for Q3 and the back half of the year. Stuart will review our financials and provide Q3 and full year guidance. We'll then take your questions.  As an originator brand, we remain at the forefront of the market we created, powerfully owning our position as the brand that defines an active, mindful lifestyle. And in a world of increasingly commoditized guest transactions, our relentless focus on innovation, human connection and our vertical business model allows our guests to enjoy holistic experiences that transcends the 4 walls of a retail store, unlocking tremendous growth opportunity as we reach new guests around the world.  From the launch of our first Mindfulosophy meditation lounge in our new store on Fifth Avenue, to the ecosystem of studio, store and community space we created for guests at Queen Street in Toronto, we design into a future of how people want to live their lives and connect with each other. Our laser-focused strategies to retain, inspire and inform guests through an enriched digital experience continues to drive performance. In Q2, we launched our first fully integrated product campaign online and in-store featuring the Enlite Bra. By highlighting its groundbreaking technology, created in our proprietary Ultralu fabric, our most innovative and most premium offering in bras quickly became a top performer, validating the significant potential ahead of us when we deliver category-disruptive innovation to our guests.  Toward the end of the quarter, we began our seasonal store retailing, showcasing lightweight jackets and outerwear. Collectively, these campaign strategies have contributed to a 23% increase in traffic year-over-year. In addition and relative to Q1, site conversion has increased by 30%.  We continue to make solid strides toward delivering a digital ecosystem that is a seamless extension of our store experiences, founded on human connection and deep product knowledge. Through improved creative photography and video that overtly highlight the innovative performance and functional detailing that defines our product, improved merchandise assortment and technical site enhancements, we are creating a consistently rich and compelling experience for guests. We are early in this journey, and I'm so excited about the tremendous impact our focus has had on the performance so far.  As you know, international is a key growth driver for us, and we see great opportunity as guests around the world seek to live more active, mindful lives. Let me start by highlighting our strong performance in Asia. Fueled by strong brand momentum, new-store openings and positive comps both in-store and online, this quarter, we saw 70% year-over-year market growth across Asia, highlighted by our momentum in China that has grown over 350% over Q2 last year. This exceptional growth is partially driven by the outperformance of new-store productivity. Our Tmall business increased 175%, fueled by more than doubling our traffic coupled with higher conversion.  Building on the brand's unique positioning to elevate lives through an active, mindful lifestyle, we hosted our second Unroll China event in May. Held across 6 cities with over 10,000 attendees, including 5,000 in Beijing, we shared the power of practice via live streaming yoga classes in Chengdu and Beijing, a concept we'll continue to develop as an extension of the brand's digital ecosystem.  We're on track to open 12 stores in Asia this year with 6 stores planned in the second half in China : in Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen. And to broaden our Asian footprint, we are thrilled about opening our third store in Japan later this year in the heart of Shinjuku, following our April opening in Ginza Six and our prior opening in Harajuku.  Having recently returned from Europe, while still nascent, it's exciting to watch the wellness trend in cities such as Paris and Munich begin to accelerate with new studios opening and increasing community engagement. Long term, I continue to see meaningful opportunity in the region as we build momentum with market growth over 50% year-over-year. We continue to believe that densification strategies in key cities, supported by a compelling digital ecosystem, is the best path to build strong brand loyalty. In the second half of the year, we're on track to open 2 new stores, including our first store in Munich.  In London, where we've built our strongest presence, I experienced firsthand our second annual Sweatlife Festival. This community event brought together 2,500 guests to experience a day of sweat offered by London's top studios while also taking yoga off the mat, through different talks, meditations and personal development sessions. Having personally done back-to-back spinning and boxing, it's safe to say that Londoners are set. Sweatlife is a very effective way to connect with and build our collective, and similar activation will be rolled out in the future.  Turning to North America. Before I share updates on Q2, our thoughts are with everyone impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And we are actively supporting our collective in the wake of this devastation. We have 8 stores in the region and have been working closely with colleagues and our communities to ensure the safety and well-being of our people and their loved ones. Returning to our North American performance this quarter. We recently opened destination locations in key market, including New York and Vancouver. In New York, we opened on Fifth Avenue, including our first-ever meditation lounge Mindfulosophy, acting as a destination for visitors from all over the world to escape the city and allow them the space to take a moment to breathe. We're thrilled with the performance so far. It's accretive to our New York store fleet and allows guests from around the world to experience the brand. In Vancouver, we have just reopened our very first store on West 4th in Kitsilano, a beautiful, colocated format that incorporates new technology, innovation and enhanced visual merchandising.  Supporting our growing presence and relevance in the run category, we were front and center at the Toronto Waterfront 10K as lead sponsor, creating incredible energy in our stores, interacting with our educators and ultimately reaching 4 million guests over the race weekend. In the Hamptons, in collaboration with SoulCycle at the Barn, we hosted guests throughout the summer. And just 2 weeks ago in Vancouver, we hosted our sixth annual SeaWheeze run and festival, arguably the best half marathon in the world, welcoming 10,000 runners from over 18 countries to experience the best of the brand and creating a positive halo impact on local store performance.  Focusing now on product. Our Q2 performance in men's positively reflect the $1 billion-plus potential ahead of us in this category by 2020. Men's is still one of our best-kept secrets, and we're focused on guest acquisition and talking to men in unexpected ways, through curated and targeted experiences, community activation and colocated stores. We continue to deliver significant outperformance in the core category of men's pants and shorts, seeing 23% growth in Q2, driven by the strength of our ABC franchise.  Tops also performed well this quarter with ongoing demand for our multiple Metal Vent styles, including Surge, where we delivered new innovation in the lightweight version, Henley and 1/2 Zip. Looking to Q3. I'm stoked about our first focused men's brand campaign launching mid-September, expressing our unique perspective as an extension of This Is Yoga.  Turning now to our women's business. Bottoms performed strongly, led by our Engineered Naked Sensation styles, Align and Fast & Free. Women's tops, both short sleeve and long sleeve, drove a really strong inflection in our comp as our guests responded positively to burnouts, engineered mesh and our supernatural fabrics, delivering the soft, natural feel guests love with high-performance attributes.  As we enter the second half of the year, I'm excited to see the momentum continuing in Q3 across jackets and outerwear, specifically within the core scuba hoodie and packables. With a dedicated focus on this category for fall, our teams have created an assortment balancing function and fashion.  Building on our core product offering, we launched an exclusive capsule collection with Taryn Toomey. Brought to life through a beautiful campaign, we had an overwhelming positive response with majority of online products selling out in the first day.  On the theme of exploration, we continue to invest in delivering the most innovative, quality, functional items across our guest needs. Given our unique ability to connect with consumers, enabled by the strength of our educators, we can easily adapt to new strategies to cater to our guests' wants and needs. For example, this fall, we're piloting our first head-to-toe guest offering in select stores across North America through a partnership with APL, a footwear brand that shares our values, [ living ] at the intersection of function and fashion. This model of partnering and learning how to deliver the best experience possible to our guests provides great insights as we explore new categories in the future.  Looking to Q3, we'll see the launch of our newest fabric innovation, Everlux, designed for high-intensity workout like spin, where a studio environment provides little airflow and high humidity as Everlux wicks the wet sweat like nothing else.  As I shared in my opening remarks, the initial response to our first global brand campaign has been positive and a great learning with an exceptionally strong connection in China as we look to accelerate how we amplify the reach and engagement of the brand. As we enter the fall, we're excited for you to see the next iteration of This Is Yoga brought to life in our men's and holiday campaigns. Before passing over to Stuart, I'd like to take a moment to share some updates to our Board of Directors and executive team. First, a very warm welcome to Tricia Patrick, who joins the board from Advent International, bringing global experience across consumer sector. I know she will bring valuable insight to all of us. I'd also like to say thank you to Steve Collins, who has stepped down from the board, for his commitment and valuable contribution during what has been such a tremendous period of growth and development for lululemon.  Following 3 years with the brand, I want to share gratitude for Duke Stump, EVP of Brand & Community, who will be moving on at the end of September. We are grateful for his leadership and commitment to building purposeful, authentic brand storytelling, and a search is underway for a new leader. Our EVP of People & Culture, Gina Warren, will be leaving as well for personal reasons, and we have a great internal candidate stepping into the role. While these changes are important, we have a strong and expanding team driving this business as it continues to grow and evolve. The brand is stronger than any of us individually. And as this result powerfully demonstrates, we are firmly in control of our destiny and believe there is tremendous potential ahead of us. In closing, this has been a standout quarter as we made significant progress within our key growth drivers. I'm excited by the momentum in our business as we enter fall, driven by product innovation, community activations and key partnerships, which build loyalty with our new and existing guests alike. I'm energized by the enthusiasm and dedication I see every day from our global collective, and I'm grateful for their passion to growing our brand. I have full confidence that we can deliver on our 2020 vision and cement our position as the leading global brand that defines an active, mindful lifestyle.  And with this said, I'll pass it over to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. As you mentioned, we are pleased with the acceleration in our business in Q2 and the positive momentum that's now continuing as we enter fall. The strength we saw in the second quarter was broad-based across all channels and reflected in our key operating metrics. Specifically, our store business saw a nice improvement in traffic that is now extending into the early part of Q3. We also saw positive trends in conversion, AUR and UPT, which gives us confidence in our store comp trends as we're not depending on any single factor. And online, while the business did benefit from our warehouse sale, the underlying KPIs are healthy as we've seen increases in both traffic and conversion as guests are responding nicely to the enhancements we're making to the site. And as Laurent also mentioned, we are still in the early innings of our e-commerce business and continue to see outsized growth potential here.  I'm also excited for the ongoing strength we're delivering in product margin. Our adjusted gross margin increased 220 basis points in Q2, well above our expectations. As we continue to elevate our game and supply chain, we expect to deliver ongoing product margin benefits as well as new strategic capabilities on which I will elaborate shortly. Before taking you through our Q2 results, I'd like to update you on the evolution of our ivivva business. As of August 20, all the ivivva stores and other locations planned to close have ceased operation. 7 locations remain operating in key markets around the country. And our Fashion Island ivivva location has been closed temporarily but will reopen in the coming months. There's been no change to our e-commerce business, which remains in full operation. We continue to estimate that total costs associated with the transition will be $50 million to $60 million, which includes the $17.7 million realized in Q1 and $5.4 million recognized in Q2. The bulk of the remaining costs will be recognized in Q3.  Now turning to the details of Q2. Total net revenue rose approximately 13% to $581 million with the increase in revenue resulting from strong performance across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 2% comp store sales increase, reflecting an acceleration sequentially from Q1. And more impressive was the 30% comp we posted in e-commerce, reflecting the ongoing success of our efforts here. We did hold an online warehouse sale in the quarter, which added approximately 14 percentage points to the overall e-commerce comp. So on a combined basis, we delivered a 7% constant dollar comp increase. We also posted increased square footage of 11% versus last year, driven by the addition of 42 net new company-operated stores since Q2 of 2016 : 24 net new stores in the U.S., 9 in Asia, 4 stores in Canada, 4 in Europe and 1 in Australia/New Zealand.  And finally, the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $2.4 million. Gross profit for the second quarter was just over $297 million or 51.2% of net revenue compared to 49.4% of net revenue in Q2 2016. The gross profit rate in Q2 was adversely impacted by 40 basis points related to the ivivva restructuring. Excluding these items, adjusted gross margin increased 220 basis points versus last year. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter with the primary driver being a 260 basis point increase in overall product margin, resulting from favorability in product mix and lower product cost, partly offset with higher markdowns due to the online warehouse sale. Offsetting these factors were 20 basis points related to foreign exchange and 20 basis points of deleverage in occupancy, depreciation and product and supply chain costs. SG&A expenses were just over $225 million or 38.8% of net revenue compared to 35% of net revenue for the same period last year. The deleverage in SG&A was generally in line with our expectations. Approximately 1/3 of the increase relates to the planned costs associated with the improvements to our e-commerce platform that we previously outlined. An additional 1/3 of the deleverage is due to costs associated with our global brand campaign, This Is Yoga, and related digital marketing. Foreign exchange contributed to the remainder of the deleverage as we anniversary-ed prior year gains. It is important to note that our FX revaluation exposure this quarter was largely mitigated due to the hedging strategies we had put in place earlier in the year.  Separately, as a result of our transition of the ivivva business, we incurred $3.2 million in asset impairment and restructuring costs associated with the writeoff of capital assets, lease exits and severance.  Operating income for the quarter was approximately $69 million or 11.8% of net revenue compared to 14.4% of net revenue in Q2 2016. Excluding the pretax charges of $5.4 million related to the planned closures of the ivivva stores, adjusted operating income for the quarter increased to $74 million or 12.8% of net revenue versus 14.4% of sales last year. As a reminder, operating margin this quarter includes approximately 120 basis points of costs associated with enhancements to our e-commerce business as previously mentioned. Tax expense for the quarter was approximately $21 million or 29.9% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 28.1% a year ago. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 30.5% in the second quarter of 2016. The tax rate came in lower than our guidance due to favorable adjustments related to our 2016 returns.  Net income for the quarter was approximately $49 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.39 for the second quarter of 2016. Net income in Q2 2017 included $4 million or $0.03 per share in ivivva-related charges. Excluding these charges, adjusted EPS was $0.39 per share compared to adjusted EPS of $0.38 last year.  We repurchased 1.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $52.93 per share. By the end of the quarter, we had completed a total of $91.5 million in total share repurchases under the current $100 million authorization, putting our weighted average diluted shares outstanding at 136.3 million.  Capital expenditures were $30 million for the quarter compared to approximately $45 million in the second quarter last year. The reduction relates primarily to lower corporate head office and IT capital versus the prior year. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $721 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was $316 million or 14% higher than at the end of Q2 2016, in line with our forward sales outlook. We expect our inventory growth at the end of Q3 and for the balance of the year to generally grow in line with our forward sales trend.  Turning now to our outlook for the third quarter and updated outlook for the fiscal year 2017. Please note that the guidance we are sharing excludes costs related to the ivivva restructuring.  We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in the business in all channels with exciting product launches, cohesive storytelling in stores and online, and an improving web experience, these factors are now carrying the momentum we saw in the second quarter into the third quarter. For Q3, we expect revenues to be in the range of $605 million to $615 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis compared to the third quarter of 2016. This also assumes the Canadian dollar at $0.77 to the U.S. dollar and 14 new-store openings in the quarter. We anticipate gross margin normalized for ivivva to be relatively flat with Q3 of last year. The strong product margin improvement we've experienced over the last year while still improving in the third quarter will moderate as we are now anniversary-ing last year's significant increases. These increases are then offset with modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation. We expect SG&A in the third quarter to delever from Q3 2016 by approximately 50 basis points. This deleverage is primarily associated with our continued efforts to deliver critical enhancements to our e-commerce website that are extending into the third quarter. Assuming a normalized tax rate of 30.4% and a 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 versus $0.50 a year ago.  For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.545 billion to $2.595 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis. As we stated last quarter, the guidance range takes into account the closures of our ivivva stores and the associated reductions in revenues. We expect to open 47 company-operated stores in 2017. This includes 15 stores in our international markets and represents a normalized square footage increase in the low double digits. We expect normalized gross margin for the year to increase approximately 100 basis points from 2016, primarily driven by product margin improvements, offset with modest deleverage in product and supply chain SG&A as well as occupancy and depreciation. We expect SG&A for the full year to deleverage by approximately 50 to 100 basis points versus 2016. This includes the digital-related investments incurred this year, which accounts for approximately 50 basis points of the increase. In addition, we will continue to invest in brand and community activities; technology, which I will speak to a bit more later; and our international expansion. As indicated in our Q3 outlook, we continue to expect the SG&A rate to moderate, and we expect leverage in Q4. We now expect our normalized fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.42. This reflects the Q2 upside, along with our continued confidence in our outlook for the second half of the year. Our EPS guidance is based on 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding and also assumes a normalized effective tax rate of 30.3%. We expect capital expenditures to range between $175 million to $180 million for the fiscal year 2017, reflecting new-store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT investments.  Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight our ongoing efforts in both supply chain and technology as we build the infrastructure needed to support a $4 billion-plus organization.  Looking at our supply chain. Over the last year, we've realized significant benefits to our product margin, thanks to the strategic initiative we began in 2015. That project led directly to reduced AUC and has contributed to over 350 basis points of product margin expansion in the last 12 months. While we're now anniversary-ing those improvements, I'm excited by the opportunities that remain for us to realize efficiencies within our supply chain and further improve our product margin. We currently have efforts underway that will allow us to dramatically improve our speed and flexibility in how we bring product to market. We're accomplishing this in several ways, including the development of a segmented supply chain to unlock efficiencies, staging fabric to better position us to chase demand and implementing new speed models for our core and seasonal styles. In addition, one of our key strategic sourcing partners is pursuing production facilities in Haiti. This would not only help us reduce lead times on product we source with them, but we would also realize freight and duty benefits as well. And turning to technology. We are focused on building capabilities that will leverage our business across critical areas and unlock new ways to engage our guests. In the near term, Julie Averill, our recently named CTO, continues to strengthen our technology team and set the IT agenda in support of our business goals. An important upcoming milestone will be the update to our website later in Q3, which will deliver site enhancements in time to impact the holiday selling period. We also continue to work to enhance our inventory allocation systems to improve how we flow product to better anticipate guest demand. Certainly more to follow but we're excited by the progress in these areas.  And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Laurent, the Everlux pant, how does that fit into the matrix regarding Luon and Luxtreme? And as you think about product and the big opportunity buckets longer term, could you speak to the to and from opportunity within women's? And any other thoughts you have on where your portfolio particularly has big opportunities to grow over the long term? And Stuart, I just had a question about thinking about digital in terms of where you are versus the investments and how you're feeling about the mobile experience and the integration with stores? And also, some of the earlier issues we saw, it seems like a lot of those are resolved, would love your thoughts. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Oliver. That was a lot of questions. Well, the Everlux fabric totally fits in our Engineered Sensation, in a more high-sweat studio environment. So it's really the continuation of what we've seen be really successful with our guests, delivering the feel that they need depending on their sweaty activities from outdoor to indoor and from high sweat to low sweat. So it's the continuation of pursuing innovation in our Engineered Sensation franchise. And given the success that we've seen with Nulu and Nulux, we're actually thrilled to continue to innovate in that area. From a men's standpoint, I mean, we're going to -- we've got a great campaign coming up with the ABC franchise that you're going to be seeing expanded. And I would point that in Q2, we've seen a really, really strong inflection with tops in general, both men's and women's, short sleeve and long sleeve, with really strong comp in the low 20s. So very happy with that. And obviously, the launch of the Enlite Bra shows that when we lead with innovation, I mean, we launched our highest price point bra, which quickly became the #1 selling bra. So that really sort of validates our position as the brand that created this market that leads with innovation. And when we deliver value to our guests, we actually have a tremendous opportunity to continue to increase AUR. As far as categories in the future, I mean, we're really excited about the assortment that will -- that is landing for jackets and outerwear. I think the pilot that we're doing with footwear really speaks to how nimble our stores are in adapting to new categories, but also the strength and the elasticity of the brand in expanding our presence in multiple categories. So very, very excited about what's coming up. Stuart Haselden : And Oliver, to answer your questions on digital, we've made great progress in the second quarter. As we look at how that's reflected in our KPIs, we're seeing a really strong improvement sequentially in conversion as well as traffic. And I think as you -- most evident as you shop the site, you can see the improvements we've made in visual merchandising, the integration of the photography improvements with just how the site shops has been meaningful in how we've been able to improve the guest experience online. On your question specifically with regard to the integration with the stores. I think the majority of the focus there has been enabling and unlocking the omnichannel aspects of our business model. The -- just pooling -- how we're able to connect the pools of inventory between the different channels has been the real focus. From a mobile standpoint, I would say we have a lot of opportunity to make improvements there. That is something that, I think, is still in front of us in terms of tackling that as a major element of the broader digital strategy. I think as we look at the website upgrades, as we look forward to -- further into Q3 and the website upgrades that we're looking to accomplish with the completion of the update that we're in the work of now, I think importantly, we're going to see additional visual merchandising enhancements. We'll be able to better shop -- guests will be able to better shop. Our outfitting options -- we'll create better outfitting options. We'll have a more powerful presentation of our franchises, such as the ABC pant that Laurent mentioned. And we're also going to importantly create greater flexibility for our e-commerce team to make updates quickly. The earlier version of the site is very brittle. It's not -- we're not able to make changes quickly. The new update will enable us to have a read-and-react capability we haven't had previously. So that will be important to ensuring we've got the -- our best foot forward with what's working on the website. There'll be some checkout improvements but more substantive checkout improvements later in the year. So we're really pleased with the progress. It's showing up in our results and look forward to providing further update on the Q3 call. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets. Kate Fitzsimons : This is Kate on for Brian. Stuart, I was just hoping you could talk a bit more about the supply chain and product margin opportunity, the work that you're doing there. Certainly understand that the product margin opportunity might moderate here into the back half as we lap some of last year's gains. But next year, how should we think about the opportunity and the timing of the supply chain work that you're doing rolling through? And also, if you could contextualize it versus the 350 basis point gain that you've seen over the last several months? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Kate. The -- first, just let me say, we're really pleased with how the teams have developed a very disciplined process across design, merchandising, planning, sourcing and logistics over the last couple of years. That effort of the team has really enabled the improvement that we've seen. As we have described, the step function improvement in the gross margin has unfolded as we have expected in the second half of '16 into the first half of '17. That being said, we are identifying ongoing opportunities to improve our product margin, not only from just the -- as we grow in scale and gain scale economies in our sourcing structure but also through a very deliberate segmentation of our supply chain. As we look at how long products live on our floor, we're able to source them more efficiently based on the lifespan they have within our assortment. And in addition to that -- and we spoke to this, I believe, a little bit on the last call, we're looking to build new capabilities in our supply chain around speed and flexibility. The opportunities we have to stage fabric, to be able to respond to demand as we see it emerging, offers really important opportunities not only to capture incremental sales as we're in a better in-stock position but also to do that in a favorable margin outcome. So those are new capabilities that we're looking to build. We're in a much stronger place to be able to play offense, if you will, with our supply chain, a place where we weren't -- we didn't have those options a couple years ago. So very excited to see those new opportunities emerging. Laurent Potdevin : And Kate, this is Laurent. I would add quickly that our focus on innovation also allows us to expand on margin through AUR. I mean, like the Enlite Bra being a really good example of that. And when I think about our focus on accessories and outerwear, those are 2 categories that have a lot of growth ahead of themselves with -- there's a lot of innovation and really healthy margins. So I mean, like our innovation will drive AUR, which in return will continue to drive margin expansion. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Laurent, I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more on the footwear pilot. Longer term, how do you see footwear as an adjacent category that you can go into? And more specifically, I was wondering, how do you think about finding what right balance in footwear between fashion and technical, especially when the technical players and the existing players in the industry are highly consolidated with substantial scale for innovation? Laurent Potdevin : Thank you. Well, I mean, we look at this pilot as a great opportunity for learn -- to learn. I mean, obviously, APL sort of lives in a similar space as we do, at the intersection of function and fashion, so it was a very natural collaboration for us. And it's -- we've been able to learn how to potentially add footwear to our assortment in our stores. And in Q4, we'll continue to pilot with an online assortment. So I mean, it's definitely an adjacent category. And we're intrigued. And we don't need the category to deliver on our 2020 commitment. So I think that's really what's critical. I mean, we're looking at a number of categories. Some of it might be in the world of product that are three-dimensional, the way you know it but far too dense. Some of it might be in the world of services or content. And so we're being very curious. We don't need any of those categories to achieve our 2020 vision to get our revenues to $4 billion. And we're excited about the learning. So we're going to continue to look at the potential of the categories and how it ties to what we're doing. And we'll see more of that in the early part of 2018. Matthew McClintock : And if I could have a follow-up. Just, Stuart, on -- you mentioned one of your partners is building a facility in Haiti and getting closer to the end market. Is that something longer term that you would expect to see more of in terms of your sourcing partners? And can you maybe talk just not only about the benefits of that, but in terms of how that -- how you can establish a better relationship with those companies when there's probably a lot of competition for that local space? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Matt. Yes, it's -- the supplier that we're making reference to is one of our closest and most important partners. And the efforts that they're in, in that regard is something we've been in discussions with them around for a while. So in some level, the volumes we'd be looking to place with them have been a part of their decision, I think, to pursue that particular opportunity. And the benefits are obvious in that the speed to market as well as the cost structure advantages are strategically appealing. And we would certainly -- we're constantly looking at different options, different regions of the world and looking, at the same time, to diversify our supplier base to create the strongest combination of suppliers. So the regional appeal of having something closer to our home market is pretty compelling. And it's certainly something that we'll look to explore and amplify where we see that it makes sense. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about your plans for physical and online warehouse sales that are built into your back half guidance? And also curious about who that customer is. Are you seeing a different customer respond to that online warehouse sale? And then just one clarification. Did you quantify how the performance of tops versus bottoms or for men's? If you could provide some color there. Stuart Haselden : Paul, let me start with the warehouse sale question. It's really -- the decisions and when we make those decisions to hold warehouse sales are really driven by our inventory position and where we see the sell-throughs and the inventory position that it makes sense for us to go ahead and pull the trigger on holding those events. We don't do it as a revenue driver. And so as we think about our revenue outlook for the second half of the year, it's not dependent on any warehouse sales. And again, we'll continue to evaluate our inventory position and make a decision on how to -- how and when and if we'll hold one in the second half. Certainly, longer lead time on the physical warehouse sales than the online. And we also -- we don't want to train our guest to wait for those. And so we want to have -- we don't want to have a predictable cadence of when we host those warehouse sales. And so we may or may not end up doing one or some combination of them in the second half. It's a lever we have to pull to stay on top of our inventory movement. The customer question around who is the customer that participates in that. It's a combination of probably some of our best customers as well as more price-sensitive customers. And we're pleased with the pretty robust interest that we see around both of those formats I think is a testament to the demand and the appetite for the brand. And also how we don't do it often. And so when we do it, we see a pretty frothy response to those sales. And then you had a question on tops versus bottoms. So we have -- we continue to see a really strong sell-through in bottoms. Strong double-digit sell-throughs really in the 20s for both women's and men's pants in the second quarter and extending into the third quarter. Tops have been strong as well, very healthy high single digit, low double-digit trends in both men's and women's tops in Q2 and into Q3. So [ other ] than stronger, but we're not unhappy with the tops trend. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, just what's not performing well? Laurent Potdevin : Well, it's a good question. I mean, we're really seeing like our efforts paying off across all of our key 4 pillars across digital, men's, international and North America. I mean, I think we've got a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. Not that it's not doing well, but there's an opportunity to realize both in accessories and outerwear. And we're really increasing our focus in both categories. I mean, accessories is a really high-margin category. It's got a lot of upside, but it's also a great point of entry for people to get into the brand and become our guest. So we're excited about that. I think we've got opportunity to do -- to have a stronger and wider assortment, both in bags, socks and intimates. And I'm really passionate about the work that we can do with outerwear. When you think about what we've done with Engineered Sensation and translating that to the world of outerwear with the amount of innovation that's available in that world and it's another high-margin category. So I would point out to these 2 categories with -- not necessarily where we're not doing well because we're really pleased with the assortment that's landing for jackets and outerwear this fall, but a lot of upside and both for men's and women's, actually. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird. Mark Altschwager : I wanted to ask about the DTC business and the performance relative to the low to mid-teens guidance you gave for Q2. Just wondering, was the warehouse sale much larger than anticipated? Or what were the factors that drove total DTC so far ahead of your plans? And then ex the sale, I think up 16% constant currency. Is that how we should be thinking about that heading into the back half of the year? Or would you perhaps anticipate some acceleration as the site enhancements and digital marketing initiatives gain some momentum? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Mark, it's Stuart. So really pleased with the e-commerce trend that we saw in the second quarter. And as I mentioned, conversion in particular recovered nicely. I think that's a result of the work that we had talked about as part of that digital acceleration effort. And the warehouse sale did exceed our expectations. It was -- actually, it set a record for us in terms of the amount of volume that we did with an online warehouse sale. So it was well above expectations. And as we think about the guidance into Q3, we're certainly putting that aside as we look at that mid-single-digit guide and looking at the trends that we're seeing currently in the business sort of more in line with the e-commerce also in Q2, excluding the warehouse sale. But there's -- there are benefits that we see in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4, from a digital standpoint. As we complete the website work that we just talked about, we are expecting that to have a tailwind on our e-commerce trend. We're still realizing benefits from This Is Yoga. We have ongoing investments in digital marketing. I think our product assortment is continuing to improve. Big opportunities for us in jackets and outerwear that Laurent mentioned into the second half of the year as that part of the assortment, in particular, improves. And on the brand marketing side, you heard Laurent mention the men's campaign that you will see later in September that will coincide with the introduction of several new styles in our ABC franchise, the first of which is our ABC slim pants that's in stores and on the website now and is really exceeding expectations. So there's a number of things that we believe offer upside opportunity for us in the second half of the year, both from a product standpoint, a brand marketing standpoint and from a channel execution standpoint. So really excited for what's in front of us. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : On your global store profile, how best to think about the pace of store openings in Asia, in Europe? Can you talk to some of the drivers of the improved productivity you've been seeing more recently? And just where do we stand on international profitability? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, I mean, I think, I'm not sure that I think about it in terms of number of store is the right metric, to be honest. I mean, we're seeing what we've done during Unroll China and how we were able to live stream to 150,000 guests. That was incredibly powerful. You look at our performance on Tmall being 175% up year-over-year. That's an incredible avenue for us to put eyeballs on the brand. And our densification strategy in key cities, whether it's London, Beijing, Shanghai or Tokyo, is really paying off. Because when we look at sort of the halo that it creates in Tier 2 cities from a social media or from a brand awareness standpoint, it's actually really, really powerful. I mean, I was really very pleasantly surprised with the impact of This Is Yoga in China, where for a very low cost of acquisition, we were able to create tremendous brand awareness. So I think that we're not going to get ahead of our ourselves with stores. I mean, we want to be really sort of vibrant in the communities that we're in, mostly in those Tier 1 cities where we're densifying. And I think that we'll continue to look at footprint the same way we're looking at it in the U.S. and like you saw products like what the work -- what the team is doing in North America where, in a mature market, we're actually incredibly nimble with the number of store formats, from local, all the way to what we've done recently on Fifth Avenue. So I think it's more a question of really being strong in those Tier 1 cities and then leveraging that, the halo that it creates with a strong digital ecosystem. And I mean, in Asia, we've got a great sort of presence on Tmall, and we're partnering with WeChat in pretty powerful ways so. And as far as the growth, I mean, the growth is -- it's consistent with what we said in the past. I mean, it's -- we're really, really excited. There's such strong momentum in Asia. It's a little bit slower in Europe. But I was there this summer, and I could -- the difference in Paris and Munich in terms of excitement, the number of studios, how people sweat was very, very noticeable. So I -- and we've got 50% growth year-over-year in that market. So I mean, it's by no means left far behind. I think it will grow slower. And we're really focused on China right now, which we think by 2020 will represent probably 60% to 70% of that Asia Pacific market. And then there was a second part to the question. Stuart Haselden : Right, on profitability. And so, Matt, now we're seeing a nice acceleration in Asia. I think we've spoken to that previously. At this point, we expect Asia to be breakeven inclusive of Australia. So Asia Pacific to be breakeven from a profitability standpoint this year. And it's going to -- we're going to be a little bit longer on the -- to reach that same milestone in our European business but feel good about the progress there as well. So then as we kind of think about the international combination of those markets and when they will collectively reach profitability, that's something we can speak to, I think, subsequently. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just one follow-up. With the competitive environment clearly amplified across the overall athletic space, you guys have definitely been an outlier. Any categories where you've found that you do need to be a little bit more promotional? And just what do you attribute your relative strength? I'm just curious on your overall take on the athletic backdrop and if you had been pulled into it in any way. Laurent Potdevin : Well, I mean, I think, we're very differentiated and we've got such a strong, unique point of view. And first of all, we created this market, and then we're driven by innovation. I mean, we're certainly not focused on being competitive to gain market share. And we're so much more than a channel. I mean, we're a brand. I mean, we created this market. We're driven by innovation. We're an originator brand. I think that's a very unique positioning. I mean, we're best in the world at human connection and at product and at solving problems for the athletes. And in the process of doing that, I mean, we're engaged with our guests every step of the way. And I think that's really unique and really powerful. I mean, people are looking for -- they are a lot more intentional with their purchases and how they behave with brand. And that's such a massive asset for us. When I think about men, I mean, I think there's a really strong redefinition around the world with what masculinity means. And again, our positioning is really unique there at the intersection of athleticism and mindfulness. So I think it's probably a mistake to look at us as a channel, like a lot of the brands you're probably thinking about. I mean, we're first and foremost a brand and that creates a form of loyalty. So I mean, our positioning is unique, and we're very, very pleased. So we don't see pressure in categories where we need to be more promotional. If anything, when we deliver innovation, we continue to be incredibly pleased with how it resonates with our guests. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Stuart, just 2 margin questions for you. I think you said that in the second quarter, markdown was unfavorable, a slight offset to the product margin. Could you just give us a little more color on what the markdown pressure was in Q2? And then just based on the guide in the back half of the year, what's left in Q4. It looks like there's a pretty decent leverage opportunity that you're guiding to, 50 bps or more. Just kind of curious, Stuart, where is that coming from? Are there investments that are rolling off? Is there something in the P&L that we should keep in mind? And then how do we think about that sustainability in leverage as we get into next fiscal year? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Certainly, Ike. So on the markdown question, in the second quarter, we had -- as we talked about, we had a really successful online warehouse sale that accounted for that 14 points in e-commerce. So that was really what drove the elevated markdowns in the second quarter. And so I mean, otherwise, we had a very healthy ongoing sort of markdown comp in our normal channel. So that is really isolated to the warehouse sale. As we look at the SG&A picture into the second half, we're pleased to see that the SG&A management efforts that we've been working on, paying off. That's reflected in the SG&A outlook for the third quarter as well as sort of what we're signaling for the fourth quarter in terms of leverage in the fourth quarter. And it's really a -- it's a combination of completing some of those onetime investments that we have related to the digital acceleration in the third quarter. And then those are sort of rolling off, if you will, into the fourth quarter and then being able to recognize the full benefit of the cost management efforts into the fourth quarter. It's also the largest quarter from a sales standpoint, offers the greatest degree of opportunity to leverage our fixed cost. And we do certainly see leverage on SG&A as a priority as we look forward over the next several years. As we've talked about, our longer-term model holds that we will deliver modest SG&A leverage as part of the strategy to achieve operating profit north of 20%. We believe that the product margin recovery that we've seen and the gross margin that it supports is on track to achieve that 20% EBIT margin. And we see the -- after we begin to clear some of these onetime investments, we'll see leverage in SG&A that'll further complement that gross margin picture and connects to, in our model, achieving that 20% EBIT margin.

You can find both on our investor site. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Laurent. Laurent Potdevin : Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to report strong Q3 results and an increase in our full year guidance. Before we cover this in detail, I wanted to contextualize the strong momentum in our business and the unique position we own within the market we created.  The retail landscape is experiencing unprecedented disruption, characterized by increasingly commoditized transactions and short-term focus. But disruption also equates to tremendous opportunity, and lululemon is at the forefront of unlocking the future of what defines a new era of human connection and a powerful evolution of retail.  Across the globe, there is a behavioral shift to live an active mindful lifestyle. Guests are drawn towards brand with purpose that reflects who they are and who they want to be. lululemon empowers our guests to design the life they'll have. This is our DNA and has been for almost 20 years now. Our stores are the heart of this community, where guests immerse themselves in the brand through products brought to life by our educators and localized experiences, such as our Mindfulosophy lounge or in-store yoga led by our ambassadors.  The constant from Bend, Oregon to Chengdu, China is the distance of connection to and being part of a local community. Online, we greatly enhanced the digital experience for our guests at the end of Q3, satisfying today's consumers' needs to explore and be inspired and also transact from any device anytime, anywhere.  Delivering on our strategy enabled us to drive an acceleration in our business in Q3. Comps were up 7% on a constant-dollar basis. Adjusted gross margin improved 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 19%. These results exceeded our guidance and keep us on our path towards delivering $4 billion in revenue in 2020.  I'm energized by the momentum we're seeing at the start of the holiday season and grateful for the incredible enthusiasm I see every day from our team serving our growing collective around the world.  Today, I'll share key highlights of the quarter and update you on our plans for Q4 and the holiday season. Stuart will provide additional details on the quarter, review our financials and provide Q4 and full year guidance. We'll then take your questions.  When looking at our model, our vertical integration is a core competitive advantage. We have end-to-end control of every aspect of our business, from every guest interaction anywhere in the world, to a margin structure that allows us to stay positioned at the pinnacle of the market we created, investing in levels of quality and functionality that are unmatched in the industry.  Our nimble and constantly evolving store portfolio from locals to co-located and experiential are highly attuned to each market's needs, reflecting industry-leading productivity while our footprint remains underpenetrated with only 388 locations across the globe.  Online, we saw a significant acceleration this quarter, with constant dollar comps up 25%, fueled by double-digit increases in traffic, transactions and delivering our best conversion this year. Our digital journey has much runway ahead. It is the conduit to how we amplify our uniquely human connection with the growing collective. And we are thrilled with the guest reaction to the enhanced new experience and committed to delivering a compelling online, off-line ecosystem to our guests.  In Q3, through focused marketing efforts, our active contactable profile list grew by 60%. We both retained and acquired more new guests and so increased transactions from our most loyal guests year-over-year. As we scale and grow internationally, a continued focus on insight and understanding of our guests will enable us to offer increasingly relevant guest journeys.  We create market-disrupting product at the intersection of function and fashion, delivering innovation in technical performance through our unique science of feel. Reflecting our unparalleled leadership in women's pants, in Q3, we launched our newest fabric innovation, Everlux. Incredibly well-received by guests, it created a [ hell ] of our women's pants category, which comped up an impressive 24% in Q3.  Going into holiday, on Black Friday, we launched another unique capsule collection for guests, collaborating with Forster Rohner, one of Europe's premier couture lace house, which contributed to our biggest week ever for pants sale in North America. And I'm also pleased to see our jackets and outerwear assortment comping 26% in Q3.  On the men's side, we saw 21% increase in new male guests transacting with us this quarter. Due to additional focus on our co-located stores, our expanded ABC franchise to -- including slim and jogger styles and our first ever men's campaign, I'm excited to say that total sales in our ABC franchise doubled in Q3 versus last year, lifted by these initiatives.  Our international growth pillar continues to reflect one of our most significant long-term opportunities. While at the beginning of this journey, the market growth across Asia was nearly 100% in Q3, while China itself grew over 450%. I visited China in late Q3 and I'm always in awe of the pace and scale of change, how digital is so intrinsically woven into every experience, seamlessly moving from online to off-line, reimagining the future of retail.  Current guest behavior informs my belief that our e-commerce penetration in China could approach 40% to 50% of our business as we continue to grow and enhance our distribution channel, including Tmall and WeChat. And as evidence from Tmall's singles day this year, where we tripled our business relative to last year.  Turning to Europe. In Q3, we experienced market growth of 40% and continue to focus our energy on the accelerating shift towards an active mindful lifestyle in Northern Europe. And we're excited by the market response to our first store in Munich, Germany, which has been incredibly positive.  No matter where we are across the globe, our digital ecosystem fuels our insight on market readiness, allowing us to build awareness, energy and connections in a community before putting a physical presence. This strategy effectively supports our Q3 new store openings and looking to Q4 in form how we're targeting 6 additional stores in Asia.  In North America, we are realizing the untapped potential in our core market across store and digital. Symbolic of the opportunity ahead, Fifth Avenue in New York and West 4th Street in Vancouver are both performing extremely well, with little to no cannibalization. Further validating our co-located store strategy and reflecting the opportunities that we see in both the U.S. and Canada due to our agile and relevant store formats.  Whether online or off-line, we value and prioritize the direct connections we have with our collectives. The rapport that exist between our guests, educators, ambassadors across all our market is the heartbeat of the brand. This quarter, the Ghost Race, a 5-mile community race powered by the Strava app is a great example of online to off-line community building, catapulting lululemon to the #1 run community on Strava despite being activated across only 15 cities. Looking at Q4 and as we head into the holidays, I'm excited and inspired by the product, experiences and connections we are bringing to our guest. In North America, we're opening 22 seasonal store nimbly meeting our guests where they are. And as the holiday season kicked off, we experienced our highest traffic and largest revenue day ever on Black Friday and on Cyber Monday, our largest day ever of online sales. And reflective of how our guest value our brand, our product and the experiences we provide, our top-selling products all weekend was the Align pants at regular price.  Amongst this backdrop, I know our holiday campaign is a breath of fresh air. \"breathe it all in\" reminds our guest to take a moment to be present, and guests are desiring this calm and connection like never before. It is just a few weeks in and is our most powerful campaign to-date. Our collective has donated 250,000 minutes of meditation. We are on track to acquire our most significant number of new guest per quarter ever, and our personalized emails are driving 15% conversion.  In closing, the strength we exhibited in Q3 and at the start of Q4 validates our strategy, demonstrates the power of our brand and the connection we have with our growing global collective. With strengthened foundation reinvested in the brand and innovation and focused on operational excellence and efficiency to build a platform to create into a future not yet realized, the momentum in our business validates our position as an originator brand leading the market we created and capturing the accelerating global shift towards an active mindful lifestyle.  We have exciting opportunities ahead of us as we expand into new international markets, deliver category disruptive product innovation and continue to explore how our brand deepens its connection across both men's and women's. Looking forward, I am more confident than ever in our growth strategy and our ability to execute powerfully against this pillar. As we head into the holidays, I want to extend gratitude for our teams around the world, who put the guest at the heart everything they do. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thank you, Laurent. As you mentioned, we are pleased with the accelerating momentum we saw in Q3 that is now extending into Q4. The strength in our business was fueled by positive performance in both our store and digital channels as well as strength in both men's and women's.  We saw solid performance across an array of KPIs, notably traffic and conversion improved in both stores and e-commerce. Constant dollar comps were up 7%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 110 basis points, driven by continued strength and above-plan performance and product margin, which improved by 70 basis points, and EPS increased 19%. Also worth noting is the moderating growth rate in SG&A, up just 70 basis points this quarter, which contributed to our adjusted EBIT margin expansion. Inventory also remained well controlled and was up 9% at the end of Q3.  Before taking you through our Q3 results in detail, I'd like to update you on the charges and costs associated with the evolution of our ivivva business. We now estimate that total costs associated with the transition will be $45 million to $50 million, down from our prior estimate of $50 million to $60 million. In Q3, we realized $22 million in impairment and restructuring costs related to the ivivva restructuring. Now turning to the details of Q3. Total net revenue rose approximately 14% to $619 million, with the increase in revenue resulting from strong performance across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 1% comp store sales increase on top of a 4% store comp in Q3 of 2016. We are also pleased with the 25% comp we posted in e-commerce. Our teams executed and refined the new processes implemented in Q1 and Q2, which enabled this acceleration in our digital business. So on a combined basis, we delivered a 7% constant dollar comp increase. Excluding the ivivva store closures, square footage increased 12% versus last year, driven by the addition of 46 net new company-operated stores since Q3 of 2016. 26 net new stores in the U.S, 10 in Asia, 4 in Canada, 3 in Europe and 3 in Australia and New Zealand.  The impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by $6.8 million while the hurricanes, which hit the U.S. during the quarter, decreased revenue by approximately $2.5 million. Gross profit for the third quarter was $322 million or 52% of net revenue compared to 51.1% of net revenue in Q3 2016. The gross profit rate in Q3 was adversely impacted by 20 basis points related to the ivivva restructuring. Excluding these items, adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points versus last year. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter, with the primary driver being a 70-basis-point increase in overall product margin resulting from favorability in product mix and lower product costs, offset somewhat by modestly higher markdowns versus last year.  I'd note that this increase comes on top of a 450-basis-point improvement in product margin last year. As our supply chain capabilities improve, we are continuing to identify margin opportunities to gain cost efficiencies across a number of areas. We saw a 20-basis-point favorable impact related to foreign exchange in the quarter and also posted 20 basis points of leverage in occupancy, depreciation and product and supply chain costs as these costs, in aggregate, came in better than expected.  SG&A expenses were just over $215 million or 34.8% of net revenue compared to 34.1% of net revenue for the same period last year. The deleverage in SG&A was generally in line with our expectations. Approximately 60 basis points of the increase relates to the planned costs associated with the improvements to our e-commerce platform that we previously outlined. Foreign exchange, including both translation and revaluation exposures, contributed an additional 60-basis-point increase. These were offset by lower professional fees versus last year, coupled with more efficient store and headquarters-related spend.  Separately, as a result of our transition of the ivivva business, we incurred $21 million in asset impairment and restructuring costs associated predominantly with lease exits. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $86 million or 13.8% of net revenue compared to 17.1% of net revenue in Q3 2016.  Excluding the pretax charges of $22 million related to the planned closures of the ivivva stores, adjusted operating income for the quarter increased to approximately $108 million or 17.4% of net revenue. As a reminder, operating margin this quarter includes approximately 60 basis points of costs associated with enhancements to our e-commerce business, as previously mentioned.  Tax expense for the quarter was $28 million or 32% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 27% a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8% versus 31.3% last year.  Net income for the quarter was approximately $59 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.50 for the third quarter of 2016. Net income in Q3 2017 included $16.4 million or $0.13 per share in after-tax ivivva-related charges. Excluding these charges, adjusted EPS was $0.56 per share compared to adjusted EPS of $0.47 per share last year.  We repurchased approximately 140,000 shares that remained on our $100 million authorization during the quarter at an average price of $60.27 per share. By the end of the quarter, we had completed our authorization, putting our weighted average diluted shares outstanding at 135.6 million. With that plan complete, we are pleased that our board recently approved a new $200 million share repurchase plan.  Capital expenditures were approximately $57 million for the quarter compared to approximately $35 million in the third quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to higher investments in IT and new store capital.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $650 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $397 million or 9% higher than at the end of Q3 2016 and below our forward sales outlook. Looking forward, we continue to expect inventory growth to generally grow in line with our forward sales trend. Before taking you through our guidance, I'd like to provide some additional color on our Q3 performance. On the men's side of our business, as Laurent stated, our ABC pant franchise increased 100% in the quarter and helped drive a 26% comp in our men's bottoms business. And we were likewise pleased with the results in women's pants, our most iconic category, which continued to deliver strong results, and comped up 24% in Q3. Our Everlux launch helped drive this trend, but core styles offered in our Nulu and Nulux fabrics also performed well.  We're also excited that the momentum we saw in both men's and women's jackets and outerwear at the end of Q2 continued into Q3 as our evolved offering is resonating well with guests. We continue to see outerwear and jackets as an important opportunity for us in Q4.  In our e-commerce business, the 25% constant dollar comp we achieved in Q3 was an important acceleration relative to the 16% comp we reported in Q2 when excluding the online warehouse sale. As Laurent mentioned, our digital business benefited as our teams continued to develop the new processes we've put in place during Q1 and Q2, focused on better photography, more intuitive merchandising and more disciplined planning.  It's also important to note that we did not launch the new website until the end of Q3. We've been happy with our guest response to the revamped site and believe this, combined with the process improvements mentioned earlier, can help drive double-digit gains in our digital business in Q4 and into 2018 and beyond. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the resulting updated outlook for the fiscal year 2017. Please note that the guidance we are sharing excludes costs related to the ivivva restructuring where applicable. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in the business across all channels as we've entered Q4.  In the U.S., we have seen positive store traffic in the first 5 weeks of the quarter and sequentially improved store traffic in our Canadian business. And our newly enhanced e-commerce site is delivering important improvements in conversion that will support continued double-digit increases in our digital business. For Q4, we expect revenues to be in the range of $870 million to $885 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This also assumes the Canadian dollar at 0.78 cents to the U.S. dollar and 16 new store openings in the quarter. We anticipate gross margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points versus Q4 of last year. Despite the strong increases in product margin last year that we're now anniversary-ing, we continue to see AUC opportunities, driven by our ongoing supply chain initiatives and the great work that our sourcing, logistics and distribution teams are delivering. We expect to leverage SG&A in Q4 by 50 to 100 basis points now that the expenses related to our digital acceleration work are predominantly behind us. Assuming a normalized tax rate of 30.4% and 135.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.22 versus $1 a year ago.  For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.590 billion to $2.605 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis. As we stated in prior quarters, the guidance range takes into account the closures of our ivivva stores and the associated reduction in revenues. We expect to open 46 company-operated lululemon stores in 2017. This includes 16 stores in our international markets and represents a normalized square footage increase in the low to mid-double digits.  We expect normalized gross margin for the year to increase approximately 100 to 150 basis points from 2016, primarily driven by product margin improvement and the benefit of mix. We expect SG&A for the full year to deleverage by approximately 100 basis points versus 2016. This includes the digital-related investments incurred this year, which accounts for approximately 50 basis points of the increase.  We now expect our normalized fiscal year 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48. This reflects the Q3 upside along with our confidence in our outlook for Q4. Our EPS guidance is based on 136.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding and also assumes a normalized effective tax rate of 30.4%.  We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $170 million for the fiscal year 2017, reflecting new store openings, renovations, relocation capital and also strategic IT investments. In closing, I'm encouraged by the success achieved in Q3 as our teams executed well across all parts of the business. We see this story continuing now into Q4. And although the key holiday weeks remain ahead of us, I'm excited by what we're seeing so far, which has enabled us to raise our guidance.  And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Just a quick question, Stuart, on the gross margin line. You're guiding a mid-single-digit comp in Q4 similar to what you did in Q3, but you're seeing a -- much more gross margin opportunity, up 100 basis points. I think you guided Q3 flat. Just can you help us understand why there's so much more optimism to start Q4 relative to where we were 3 months ago for Q3? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Ike. And just to offer a little context on Q3, and I think it sets us up for the guidance that we've offered on Q4. So really pleased with the ability to post the margin -- the gross margin expansion that we saw in the third quarter lapping the big increases that we saw in 2016. And as we mentioned, the beat to our expectations really came through the favorable selling mix. In particular, the great comps that we've seen in pants, both men's and women's, and those categories bring with them some of the best margins in our assortment. And AUC results have also been quite favorable. And this reflects the ongoing work of our supply chain team. As we've talked about over the last couple of years, the work on the segmentation of our supply chain, the reduction of fabric liability, the better management of airfreight, the elimination and reduction of cancellations, all these things are continuing to extend the benefits that we've been able to capture. I think we have been pleased by the runway that we've been able to build on the margin improvement really exceeding our original expectations, where we had seen the lion's share of the improvement really happening second half of '16, first half of '17, we've been able to beat our own expectations there and the teams have been able to identify opportunities into the future, which is really a part of the gross margin guidance in the fourth quarter. And I would say that those opportunities don't end in the fourth quarter of this year. So the fourth quarter guidance reflects all those factors that I just mentioned in terms of where we've been able to identify efficiency in our supply chain. And it's worth noting that the selling mix benefits that we saw in the third quarter was -- they were not how drew up the quarter. We're pleased with how it's performed. To the extent that we see selling mix favorability in the fourth quarter, it could be some upside. But in general, we are pleased with the results that we've been seeing, not only in the third quarter, but into the first period of the fourth quarter. And what we're -- I think what we're seeing now really reflects the new margin architecture of the business. And this is a key element of the EBIT margin equation that we've been talking about for a while that will get us to an EBIT margin that starts with a 2. Operator : The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : A couple of questions. The first one just, Laurent, the organizational structure for merchandising, it seems like there's been some changes there. Can you kind of talk of about what the right structure is for that part of your business and maybe where there might be some holes in leadership that you might want to fill? Laurent Potdevin : Yes, it's a good question. With Lee's departure, I mean, obviously, we've created a void with the credit director and we are incredibly grateful for the work that we've done with Lee for the past 3 years and where we've been able to take products. And we've -- during the transition, we've been able to launch spring '19 and do the credit kick off with him. So there's really no change in strategy or direction. I mean, that's a departure that was really driven by personal reasons. But when I look at the organization, you're going to see one announcement next week on the women's design side, which will be really powerful. But I think about head of design in men's, I mean, I think about how we're leading on the merchandising side, or from the innovation side, I mean, really, the 4 -- when you think about the pillars, the function, design and merchandising, I feel like we're in really, really strong shape. And obviously, '18 is very much planned already with the exception of up some capsules and collaborations that we're excited about. And the spring '19 kickoff that we had just a couple of weeks ago was probably one of the strongest that I've seen. So we're going to look for a creative director. But clearly, we're in no rush to fill that void. It's a very, very important role. It's not an easy role to fill and we've got incredible talent and people in all the key roles to continue to deliver and accelerate on the performance that you've seen so far. So I feel really, really good. Matthew McClintock : And then, if I may, one more quick one. Just on China, outstanding growth in that region, and you threw out the 40% to 50% longer-term penetration potential there. Can you maybe talk about your ability, how fast can you ramp that business up without initially overheating it, or is there a level of growth that's sustainable that we should be thinking about for that region? Or is it something that it's a land grab in some ways? Laurent Potdevin : You know what, it's -- every time I go, I learn so much and I'm amazed by -- I think it's hard to understand the scale unless you're on the ground. And so having been there and visiting Guangzhou, spending a day on the Alibaba headquarter and then being in Beijing and Shanghai. I mean, it's really interesting to see you've got 415 million Millennials. You've got the government that has a really strong plan, there are 2030 health plan, which is pushing people to be more active. You've got this -- you've got 130 million Chinese people traveling the world year-round. So a picture of Germany and France, like spending the whole year of travel, I mean, it's massive. And so when you see this group of Millennials more and more interested in an active and mindful lifestyle, more and more interested in experience. I mean, in many ways, they are leapfrogging what we have experienced with brick-and-mortar retail in North America and Europe. So we've got a brand with little awareness at this point, we've got a lifestyle that is really aspirational to this group. And so it's really the sky is in the limit. So -- I mean, I think it's hard to say where -- when we're going to mature. But seeing single day like tripling year-over-year, I think we've actually sum up the word that we've done with some of our ambassadors, with some of our influencers, we can actually accelerate that growth. It was really very exciting to land in Shanghai and walk by the newsstand and see our product on the cover of Harper's Bazaar, something that has not happened in North America. And I think it really speaks to how well, who we are and what we stand for resonates with that guest. Operator : The next question is from Brian Tunick with RBC. Brian Tunick : I guess, one for Laurent. Laurent, maybe on the $4 billion or this high-teens sales growth CAGR the next couple of years that you keep laying out, I guess, was curious, between the buckets of North America, international, men's and digital, sort of what line item in there are you most confident in to get you to that $4 billion revenue number? And then maybe, Stuart, can you maybe talk about how we should be thinking about SG&A dollar growth going forward now that the e-comm and some of the contractor work is behind us. So the fourth quarter a good proxy for how we should be thinking about SG&A dollar growth or leverage? Laurent Potdevin : Brian, when I think about the -- thanks for your question. When I think about the 2020, I mean, I think about it in very simple terms. And I think we've outlined that in the past. But I mean, I think that by 2020, we've got $1 billion, like, digital business. We've got $1 billion men's business and we've got $1 billion, like, international market. And within international, obviously, it's going to be more heavily weighted on Asia. Within Asia, it's going to be more heavily weighted on China. And within China, it's going to be more heavily weighted on digital. But I mean, I think one really simple way to think about it is 1 million in men, 1 million in digital, 1 million in international. And obviously, the balance is continuing to do what we do so well with the rest of the business, especially with women's and driven by innovation, which we've seen resonating incredibly well in Q3 with the launch of Everlux in women's pants. Stuart Haselden : Okay. And Brian, let me try to answer your question on SG&A. So the -- as we've talked about previously, we are calling for SG&A leverage to help us achieve the EBIT margin rate in the low 20s. And as we've talked about previously, Q4 was an important period for us to begin delivering on SG&A leverage. As we look forward, and I'll give more color on Q4 in a second, but as we look for beyond the fourth quarter, we're going to plan a modest degree of leverage in our 5-year plan. And the rationale there being at a mid-teens total revenue growth, we want to ensure that we are providing the dollars to fund our growth initiatives each year so that we're not harvesting the business. We're continuing to reinvest at a healthy pace that will help sustain that top line trajectory. But also, in a very disciplined manner, allow those top like increases to promote through to earnings. So that is definitely how we've drawn up the plan, and we think that Q4 -- and I would also -- I would point to Q3 as well, as an important evidence of us achieving that plan. If you look at the third quarter, we had 70 basis points of deleverage. 60 basis points of that was related to the e-commerce recovery. You had another 60 basis points from FX. Offsetting that was 50 basis points of leverage from some of the cost management actions that we've been taking. So the overall picture in the quarter, if you take out the -- sort of the onetime recovery for our digital business, is it's pretty healthy from an SG&A standpoint. And then as we look into the fourth quarter, largest quarter from a revenue standpoint, easier for us to leverage our fixed cost. We're also getting past those digital acceleration onetime costs, so we don't have that weighing on the SG&A picture in the fourth quarter. The full benefit of the cost management action that we began in the beginning of the year, this connects to the SG&A leverage improvement that we guided to, that this is definitely part of our thinking for the business model as you look forward, continuing to invest in growth but doing so in a disciplined manner. Operator : The next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Our question is about digital and digital plus stores and what you're thinking about for the next opportunities for innovation in digital and also, as you think about driving community and mindfulness and the integration of your online and your physical stores. And then I had a product question, Laurent. What are your thoughts -- you've had such great momentum in the bottoms business. How are you feeling about the tops and the synergies there and the presentation of color relative to the past, that'd be great. Laurent Potdevin : Thanks, Oliver. So the first question was about digital, right? And when you think about our unique point of differentiation are really the heartbeat of this brand is our educators, our guests, our ambassadors and our ability to create the most amazing human connection and delivering credible product. And when you think about product, I mean, I don't think product is necessarily limited to 3-dimensional products that you wear. And so without saying too much, I mean we think that we've got a tremendous opportunity to enhance and amplify, that's particular truth in China right now. We've got an opportunity to really enhance the connective tissue between our guests, our ambassadors and our educators. And I see that one really good example of that is -- an O2O, what they refer to as O2O in China, an off-line to online event that we did with Alibaba, where we sold 250 tickets for a Yoga class in Beijing. So they were sold on Tmall. They sold out in 30 seconds. It was pouring rain, 247 people showed up. It was live streamed to 125,000 people and I think that day, we did about $700,000 in sales as a result of that exercise. I mean, I think that, that's where you can really see our ability to amplify what we just saw at the community level on a global scale. So that's -- and again, when we talk about creating transformational experiences for our guests, it goes beyond product the way you know product today. So I think that gives you enough hints as to how we think about our digital strategy. And I totally forgot about the second. Oliver Chen : The second question was about tops and just the parts of your assortment where you still see some opportunity, as you had such really awesome growth rates on the bottoms business. And then, Stuart, just functionally, from buy online, pick up in-store and inventory accuracy, what are some of the tactical opportunities and thinking about omnichannel that you're testing and that will harvest some results potentially over the next few quarters? Laurent Potdevin : Well, just quickly, Oliver, on the product question. I mean, clearly, what we've done with the Enlite Bra and what we've seen since then really speaks to our ability to be just as strong in the bra category as we're in women's pants. And I'm actually really excited about the innovation and that's coming in '18 in the bra category. So when you think about owning her trust and her closet for both bottoms and bras, I mean, this is -- those are the 2 anchor categories, and that really -- that trust extends across every other category. So that's -- I think we're on a really good track there. But -- and I'm excited about the innovation and that's coming in '18. Same thing with tops, when you think about new fabrics, new construction, I mean, we know that there is a -- she wants to see more natural fabric. And you're going to see natural fabric from us, which were real technical, functionality is incorporated, but you're going to see the best of worlds coming into July in 2018. So we're excited about that as well. Stuart Haselden : And Oliver, on your question on omnichannel. We're excited for the new functionality we'll introduce in '18 with buy online, pick up in-store. We're thrilled with what we've seen on other omnichannel initiatives, ship from store has been very successful. BBR is our highest comping channel as we think of it in those teems in the company. Our business models continues to become more and more omnichannel. Our stores and digital businesses become more and more intertwined every day. So we're excited that we're able to recognize demand in one channel and fulfill it in another in a more and more seamless manner as we develop these capabilities. I'm going to invite Celeste to also offer some comments as she is with us today. Celeste Burgoyne : Yes, thanks, Stuart. I mean, I think, Stuart, you spoke to the highlights in terms of omni, the way we know it today, in terms of ship from store, BBR and then buy online, pick up in-store, the launch next year. I think what I get the most excited about is how, first of all, agile our stores are in terms of merely being able to adapt and to be able to integrate omni into everything they do. And for us, the way I really look at it is, obviously, omni and digital go hand-in-hand with stores. And it's becoming more of a way we operate. And every touch point is really a touch point that we own, and we're leveraging both channels for what they're best able to deliver for us. As we look at our store portfolio rollout, as well as our digital business, we see kind of all those rise in our ability to use each channel strategically allows for that. And I don't know if you guys have seen today, but we actually won the Glassdoor #1 Retailer in both Canada and the U.S. from a retail employee satisfaction perspective, which again, to me, really is one of our key competitive advantages and allows us to really play local and leverage digital at the same time. So again, I think omni is kind of in a lot of ways our middle name and really how we look at the business. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Stuart, as we think about gross margins from here more in a longer-term basis, any structural impediments which would prevent the model from returning to the mid-50s prior peak margin that we saw years back? And just how would you rank the gross margin drivers of expansion next year? Stuart Haselden : Sure. As you look at the peak gross margins of the company a few years back, the assortment was very different. The mix of men's and women's was very different. And within women's, you had a much simpler raw material palette that the designers and merchants were working with. We have many more fabrics today that give a different profile from a cost structure and economic standpoint. So I don't see the -- see us returning to that gross margin in the mid-50s. I do see room for improvement in product margins, in particular, from where we are today, and that's part of the comments I offered earlier. I would also add, as you look below just the product margin line and you look at the cost for the product team and the supply chain teams, I do see substantial opportunity to leverage those products. We've made a lot of big investments over the last couple of years. So we do see opportunity there. And likewise, in occupancy. And you saw that in the most recent quarter, where I think we reported 20 basis points of occupancy leverage in the third quarter. You go back a couple of years ago, we were reporting, like, 100 basis points of occupancy and depreciation deleverage. So I think as our real estate portfolio has matured, particularly, as we've expanded the international part of the portfolio, and that those stores have seasoned in the overall portfolio in terms of the incremental additions of rent, it's at a place where we can begin to leverage that -- those costs into the future. So we'll certainly talk more on the next call about the -- about where we see gross margin get more specificity into 2018 and beyond. But the drivers that I would point to were the same thing that I mentioned earlier. The -- in particular, the segmentation of the supply chain, and what I mean by that is as we separate the different products in our assortment based on their life cycle on our selling floor, we're able to source them differently and more efficiently. And so that's been a big part of the savings and the improvements, efficiencies we've seen up to this point. That continues to be an opportunity, although not as large, not the big step function that we saw in '16 and early '17, but it's still an opportunity. And more exciting to us, as we transition our supply chain past just getting efficient and more coherent, we're beginning to be able to play offense and implement -- begin to test and implement speed models, which will compress our development cycle times. And we also have the opportunity to build stronger capabilities for Fast Turn and chase, which again will enable us to have more precise and accurate assortment and inventory decisions, which will reduce markdowns, which will be in turn benefit margin. So those are the things I'd point to. And again, when we're together again for the fourth quarter call, we'll be able to offer you additional details. Laurent Potdevin : And Matt, if I can just chime in. I mean, today, you've got a very different organization that you had at the time of peak margin. I mean, today, you've got a runway of international growth, you've got a men's business, you've got a digital opportunity. I mean, we've got a real strong runway. Like, our destiny is within our hands, and that's really driven by a rich pipeline of innovation. And so that's a very -- that's very sustainable and profitable model. And at the time of peak margin that you're referring to, I mean, you didn't have those opportunities ahead and you had a pipeline of innovation that was very dry. So, I mean, today, you're in a position that is far more sustainable with far more scale as we look to the foreseeable future. Matthew McClintock : Great. And then just on the balance sheet net cash position, annual free cash flow generation seems to be really nicely ramping here. Can you just talk to some of the priorities for excess cash going forward as we move into next year and beyond? Stuart Haselden : Sure, absolutely. The priorities for our cash, really, the #1 priority is funding the organic growth of our business. And we are excited that we continue to identify great investment opportunities, whether its category expansion with the men's or the international expansion into Asia and Europe, those are the #1 priority for our cash. But even with that, you're correct, we're generating significant free cash flow. The next elements that -- or the next parts of the use-of-cash strategy is first creating financial flexibility to -- for us to evaluate a number of different ongoing strategies, and that would include a healthy return of cash strategy that you've seen in the last couple of years with our share repurchase program. So as that cash builds, we'll evaluate the priorities across those elements that I just mentioned and determine how best to deploy it. But again, I think as we wrap up the year and on the fourth quarter call, we can probably offer a little more detail on our use-of-cash strategy and what you should expect into next year and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, can you talk about what was store traffic in the third quarter in the U.S. and Canada? Also what you assume for store comp within your fourth quarter comp guidance. And then just separate, can you talk a little bit about the performance of the Fifth Avenue store? How does that store compare to some of your higher volume stores? Is it teaching anything about where the brand might resonate that you weren't thinking previously? And what percent of that store is tourist? Stuart Haselden : Sure. Thanks, Paul. Store traffic in the U.S. and Canada, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, is sequentially improved in the third quarter. There were periods of the third quarter where we saw positive store traffic in the U.S. And -- but for the overall -- overall quarter, U.S. store traffic is narrowly negative. Canada was a bit tougher. And while we saw the Canadian store traffic results improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, it's still negative. As we look at the fourth quarter comp guidance, there's a few things I would point to. The -- we have seen, quarter-to-date, through the first 4 weeks in the U.S, positive store traffic. So that's been very encouraging to see. It's been tougher in Canada, similar to the relationship that we saw in the third quarter. Sequentially improved, but not as strong in Canada as it has been in the U.S., and still negative in Canada. The -- we are not seeing necessarily a deceleration. As you look in the mid-single digit comp versus what we reported in Q3 is offsetting, we're not seeing a deceleration embedded in that fourth quarter guidance. What I would say is we're seeing peak periods so far in the fourth quarter, like the Black Friday week, outperforming expectations with the other periods that are not as peak as that being slower. So the trend overall has been choppy, if you will, with the highs being higher and the lows being lower. And as we sit today, we still have 70% of the quarter in front of us, some massive weeks coming up in the next 4, 5 weeks. So we feel like the guidance we offered of mid-single digit is appropriate [indiscernible] at this point. So -- and I'm going to defer to Celeste on the Fifth Avenue question. Celeste Burgoyne : Paul, and just on the traffic, one thing I would want to add on the traffic is we're also going where traffic is. So there's traffic comp and then how we're looking at our store portfolio is we're really also super open to deepening our experiences within these markets, and we have a strategy that is our seasonal store strategy. So this holiday, we've opened up 22 pop-up seasonal stores that will be in good traffic, decent malls and really capturing business where traffic is. So again, when you look at traffic comp, that's one piece of it. But we're also really looking to see how we become and continue to be really agile. Those stores from a seasonal perspective, we're really happy with results so far. But from an acquisition perspective, they are trending at about 50% of their guests are new guests. So again, just shows one of the strategies we're doing and it complements our other strategies from a community perspective to drive store comp traffic. In terms of Fifth Avenue, really happy with Fifth Avenue. It's quickly risen to the #1 store in the U.S. We are seeing really good AOV and really good UPT. In terms of tourist, it is over-indexing our other New York stores in terms of the percentage of tourists. That tourist is international as well as U.S. So mainly, Midwest and then international. So really happy, definitely over-indexes in tourists and new acquisition. And again, as an example for us of how we can definitely have more touch points in-market. So in New York City, we've been very, very, very little cannibalization from opening Fifth Avenue. And we actually have Time Warner on the books to open in the second half of 2018. And another good example of our ability to kind of go deeper in-market is Robson in Vancouver. Robson is our #1 store in Canada. And we opened Pacific Centre, which is 3 blocks away. And again, a really good example of where we're not seeing cannibalization and we're seeing an ability to really lead and run 2 very distinct businesses with really great community impact. Operator : The last question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : A couple of product questions. First on accessories. That assortment has really ramped over the last few months and seems like a nice opportunity over the holiday gifting period. Just curious what the penetration of accessories is today and how much you think that it can expand over the next few years here? And then separately on footwear, just curious on the learnings from the pilot and whether that can be a needle mover here in the short run. Laurent Potdevin : Yes, thank you. Well, on the accessory, I mean, we've -- our penetration right know, I think, is around like 7% or 8%. I mean, I said before, that for a brand, that is as strong and as aspirational as we are. I mean, we have the potential to be in the 12% to 15%. So certainly, we have a lot of runway. We've seen a nice acceleration in the latter part of Q3, probably as a result of the assortment that you're referring to. And we see the bulk of the opportunity really in bags, socks, yoga mat and headwear. I mean, obviously, we've got sort of other accessories on the side, but that's where you're going to see the bulk of the business coming from. So a nice opportunity for us with -- which is a great guest acquisition strategy and it's a high-margin category. So that's the penetration. It's, again, what we see as the potential. And the second question was... Mark Altschwager : The footwear pilot. Laurent Potdevin : Well, footwear. I mean, what it's speaks -- it's an interesting pilot. I mean, what we are learning is that our stores are incredibly nimble and that they can adapt to new categories very quickly. But that was rolled out in a matter of weeks, really. So that speaks to the agility of our store. And it also speaks to the fact that our guests trust us beyond the category that they are in currently. So we're taking those learnings and we're thinking about what category this would apply to in the future, but not necessarily footwear. Operator : This concludes the time allotted for questions. I will turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks for joining us, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you in about 3 months when we report our fourth quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Murphy : Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everybody. It's been a while since I've been on an analyst call but I plan on being brief today because we have a full slate of speakers. What I can say to you is, overall, the board was very pleased with our performance in 2017 clearly was a market share gaining year across categories, across channels, across all geographies. What was really gratifying for I know the management team but also for the board is how we actually recovered after a tough Q1. We diagnosed what went wrong, and we took quick action. And when you look at the year, we actually improved sequentially. I mean, you've been through the P&L. This is not the first call in 2017, it's actually the Q4 call. When you look at it sequentially, the business improved from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 across pretty much every KPI, which Stuart will take you through in a second. What that tells us as a board, and I'm sure the management team -- not that I'm just sure, I know the management team feels that this was a real testament to the character of the people of the SSC, our people who work in our stores, all our educators, that the business was able to recover very quickly from a disappointing Q1 to produce the overall 2017 results that we're showing you today. I was actually in Vancouver last week. I was kind of joking with the management team that this is the kind of quarter that you take, you laminate, you frame and, ultimately, you replicate.  Now last week, we had a board meeting in Vancouver, and the management team presented to us, in actually pretty good specific detail, their 2018 strategic initiatives, where they're going to focus their time and where we're going to invest our capital. So you're going to hear, not just on today's call and in the Q&A but in subsequent calls in 2018 like you have for the last couple of years, you're going to hear today from Celeste and Stuart and Sun about how we're going to continue to focus on product innovation, category extensions, our digital business, our international expansion and much more. So our top strategic priorities that you've been hearing about for a while, obviously, are intended to drive long-term shareholder value.  What I can tell you from last week's meeting while we spend a lot of time on those strategic initiatives and the levers to create value, what I would say is that the board really was engaged. The management team took us through not only those strategic levers but they took us through how they plan to actually build on our competitive advantages of people, community and guest experiences. Every company, they will change every year but when you have a 5-year vision like we do to 2020, everybody has key strategic initiatives they work on, they refine them, and they tighten up, they make them better every single year, and that's what lululemon is doing in 2018. But foundationally, this business, which will celebrate, by the way, its 20th anniversary in 2018, sits on a very clear set of competitive advantages : our people, our focus on community and our guest experiences. So one thing I will add from the board meeting last week is that we acknowledge as a management team, Stuart, Celeste and Sun and everybody who came and presented to the board, we acknowledge we're a little behind on data analytics and embracing the power of data. So we have a number of company veterans as well as some new execs we met last week in Vancouver who joined the business from outside lulu who are already working hard to turn this into a strength of the company. You add data to the competitive advantages I took you through and the strategic initiatives in 2018 and beyond, and that's going to be really something that's going to ignite the performance of the business. Lastly, I'm pretty sure there's going to be a number of questions on the CEO search. Why don't I just get ahead of that. It's been less than 2 months. We've met a number of actually great candidates and people who put their hand up to be considered for this incredible role amidst a very unique brand in retail and look at our performance in Q4 and our intent to maintain that kind of performance as we go forward. So the board's very confident in our ability to attract a top, proven, global consumer executive. So right now, with the time it's going to take as we're going to take our time, we're going to meet as many people as we can, we're going to make the right decision. We're very fortunate as a company to have the 3 leaders you're going to hear from today. They're working well together. They're not waiting around. They're pushing ahead aggressively to take lululemon to new heights. With all that said, let me pass the call over to Stuart to take you through the financial results for 2017 and to talk about 2018. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Glenn. Let me start by offering some highlights on the quarter. Q4 was an important period for us with several key moments of truth. First, we began to see powerful benefits from our new website. Second, we lapsed tough comparisons in both comps and product margins. Third, we cleared the expense pressure from the digital recovery earlier in the year. And finally, we accomplished all of this while scaling product innovation, expanding internationally and introducing new store formats. I'm pleased to report that the results our teams delivered exceeded expectations across the board. Our website relaunch enabled important new capabilities and helped us achieve a 42% constant dollar increase in e-commerce in Q4.  Our combined constant dollar comp for the quarter was 11% on top of strong business in 2016. We saw normalized gross margin expand 200 basis points, and we leveraged SG&A by 90 basis points. This produced adjusted operating margin expansion of 290 basis points for Q4 and 100 basis points for the year, moving us toward our 2020 goal of EBIT margins above 20%. All of this connected to normalized EPS growth of 33% for the quarter, which comes on top of the 18% growth we delivered in the same quarter last year. Reflecting on 2017. While we continue to see exciting innovation in our product assortments and store channels, the more remarkable part of the story has been our digital business. Transformation may be too strong of a word but we certainly now have new capabilities in this area that are accelerating our growth. Celeste will share additional details but we are thrilled not only with the numbers we are seeing but also with how well the teams across technology, merchandising, marketing and e-commerce operations are collaborating.  Looking ahead, we're excited for 2018 with steady improvements in our product assortments and key innovation launches, setting us up well for this year. As we are now in the early days of 2018, we are seeing the hard work over the last year continuing to pay off. Store traffic is accelerating into Q1 and fueling sequential increases in store comps. Product innovation launches in Everlux, Enlite and ABC in men's are providing powerful tailwinds in our assortments. Online conversion, benefiting from the new website, continues to exceed expectations. Our digital business continues to have much low-hanging fruit with additional opportunities in the near term to fuel further conversion increases with website improvements planned this year and checkout search and personalization. And finally, international continues to be an exciting part of the story with accelerating store growth in Asia and Europe. Looking beyond this year to 2020 and thereafter, we see a truly global business, dual gender, digitally enabled, with store and online communities driving authentic guest connections in new and innovative ways. We continue to shape the industry through our product innovation strategies and new category expansions that solve problems for our guests. This vision supports the financial and operational goals we have previously offered for 2020 : $4 billion in total revenue, a $1 billion men's business, 25% e-commerce penetration and $1 billion international business. We are on track to achieve our goals, and we're excited by the momentum we're currently seeing across the business. Let me now hand it over to Celeste to provide additional details. Celeste Burgoyne : Thanks, Stuart. I am happy to report strong Q4 results in North America where both store comps and store traffic increased by low single-digit percentage. As Stuart mentioned, we now see store traffic trends accelerating into Q1. And while the retail environment has somewhat improved, we believe much of our momentum is the result of our omnichannel initiative as well as our investments in digital and brand marketing. In 2017, our square footage growth was 14%, excluding the ivivva closures, and our plan calls for low double-digit growth in 2018. Our multiple store format enable us to reach guests where they live, delivering localized tailored experiences. We continue to be happy with the performance of our colocated stores. In 2017, we completed 12 colocated projects in which we expand the size of some of our most productive stores to allow for a more complete expression of our men's collection and create space for potential future category extension. In 2018, we plan to accelerate this program with approximately 20 to 25 stores in this powerful format. I'd also like to highlight our successful seasonal store strategy. For the holiday season this year, we opened 24 pop-up locations. Not only did these stores allow us to fulfill holiday demand but they were also a way to attract new guests. And in fact, 40% of the gap in these seasonal pop-ups were new to lululemon. As Stuart mentioned, our digital and e-commerce business saw structural changes with transformative investments across people, process and technology. In short, it's working. Our Q4 performance reflected this with total constant dollar e-com comps up 42%, which is on top of the 12% increase last year. Traffic was up in the double digits, and we saw our best quarterly conversion results of the year. The sequential comp acceleration in Q4 was enabled by the release of our new website at the end of Q3. This release offered improved functionality, more compelling content and storytelling and improved product imagery. A few KPIs I'd like to share since the relaunch include : a 20% increase in site traffic; a 19% increase in conversion with mobile conversion increasing 21%; a 19% increase in direct visits; and a 32% increase in e-mail visits. And as a complement to our digital strategy, our omnichannel capabilities continue to expand. Our endless aisle functionality allows us to fulfill in-store demand with our e-commerce inventory. We have the ability to ship from store in 186 locations, and we'll further expand this capability in 2018. We will also roll out buy online, pick up in-store functionality during the second half of the year. Switching now to international. We continue to see a strong guest response as we expand our footprint and drive awareness. In Asia, for instance, our combined comps were 52% in Q4. In particular, we saw strength in digital where comps grew in the triple digits. We continue to go after local e-commerce and experiences which, in China, will soon include a WeChat store to augment our very successful Tmall e-commerce business in the region. We ended the year with 23 stores in Asia with our comping stores generating higher sales per foot than our overall corporate average.  Looking toward 2018, we plan to open 15 to 20 new locations in this region. In Europe, our total market growth was 42% in Q4. In 2018, we plan to open 5 to 10 stores in the U.K., Germany and France, with 4 planned for Q1. We are encouraged by recent trends in Europe and continue to see this as a major opportunity for us, although likely a slower build versus Asia. Turning now to digital and brand marketing. This past holiday was our most successful to date in terms of reach, engagement and collective growth. We acquired approximately 1 million new guests with the largest growth coming from 18- to 35-year-olds. And by the end of the year, we doubled our e-mail file versus last year, expanding an important vehicle for us to directly engage our guests and drive traffic across both stores and online. And finally, I want to share gratitude for our educators and employees around the world. Our people are our competitive advantage. We know that when our people grow, our business grows, and these results are a testament to our amazing collective. Now to you, Sun. Sun Choe : Thanks, Celeste. I'm excited to speak to you about our Q4 merchandise strategies, which continue to gain momentum and set us up well for 2018. First, in women's, guest response to our holiday assortment was fantastic, as demonstrated by the strength we saw across categories. Outerwear and accessories are key for the fourth quarter, and our assortments clearly resonated. Jackets and outerwear comped up in the low double digits, led by puffer and parka shape, and our new collection of seasonal bags or standout giftables. Women's tops were also strong, which comped up 8%, driven by our seamless program. Our core business and women's pants was up 19% with continued growth driven by our engineered Naked Sensation. In Q1, we've injected newness into our #1 women's pants style, the Align, expanding the print and pattern offering on top of a new length introduced in Q4. We've also leveraged our Nulu fabrication in the launch of the Flow Y bra. In January, we excited our guests with new product flows that previewed our spring color palette, and we are encouraged by the response thus far to a greatly improved balance of color, print and pattern, now in-store and online, relative to our offering this time last year. Looking forward, I'm thrilled by our product pipeline, which delivers a unique blend of function and fashion that speaks to our guests and continues to scale our recent technical innovations.  Turning to men's. Trends remained robust, posting double-digit comps in Q4. This was driven in part by ongoing strength in bottoms where comps increased 21%, and we're happy to share that this overall momentum in men's has accelerated into Q1. Our guests continue to love our expanded ABC offering. The jogger is now our #1 pant style in men's, and as of Q1, available in a broader color range. We are further scaling our ABC technology with all of our men's fixed waist bottoms now featuring this construction. Our men's outerwear business was also strong in Q4 comping up 20%. We're building on this trend this spring with the new collection of lightweight jackets. In addition, we are executing targeted strategies to drive guest awareness for men's. One recent example is a new collection in partnership with Roden Gray, a leading Vancouver-based menswear boutique, which was successful and sets the stage for larger product collaborations over the course of the year.  We're proud of the guest response to our products, and we're determined to build upon this success going forward. I now hand it back over to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Sun. Before taking you through our Q4 financial results, I'd like to update you on certain nonrecurring charges and expenses incurred during the quarter. First, we realized the final charges and costs associated with the evolution of our ivivva business. These totaled $1.9 million in Q4 and $47.2 million for the full year and were in line with our most recent estimate of $45 million to $50 million. Second, we recognized a onetime income tax expense of $59.3 million related to the recent U.S. tax reforms. I'll now provide some further highlights on our Q4 results. Please see the Q4 financial supplement posted on our investor site for additional details. Total net revenue rose approximately 18% to $929 million, with the increase in revenue resulting from strong performance across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 1% comp store sales increase on top of a 6% store comp in Q4 of 2016. We're also pleased with the 42% comp we posted in e-commerce that reflected the enhancements to our website mentioned earlier. Normalized for ivivva, square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 46 net new company operated stores since Q4 of 2016, 24 in the U.S., 12 in Asia, 6 stores in Canada, 2 in Europe and 2 in Australia and New Zealand. The impact of the foreign exchange increased revenues by $11 million. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $523 million or 56.3% of net revenue compared to 54.2% of net revenue in Q4 2016. The gross profit rate in Q4 was positively impacted by 10 basis points related to the ivivva restructuring. Excluding this benefit, adjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points versus last year. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter with the primary driver being a 130 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from favorability and product mix, lower product costs and lower markdowns versus last year. I'm particularly pleased that this increase comes on top of a 410 basis point improvement in product margin last year. We continue to see opportunity to gain cost efficiencies within our supply chain. For example, this year, as we further improved our planning processes, we're able to ramp down a portion of our air freight usage and increase ocean freight. This shift will help us continue to expand product margin into 2018.  We saw 30 basis points of favorable impact related to the foreign exchange impact in the quarter and also realized 40 basis points of leverage on occupancy and depreciation. SG&A expenses were just over $264 million or 28.4% of net revenue compared to 29.3% of net revenue for the same period last year. We're pleased that we were able to deliver expense leverage in Q4 at the high end of our expectations. Approximately 60 basis points of the decrease relates to more efficient spend in both our home office and store channel, while foreign exchange, including both translation and revaluation exposures, contributed an additional 30 basis points of leverage. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $256 million or 27.6% of net revenue compared to 24.9% of net revenue in Q4 2016. Excluding the pretax charges of $1.9 million related to the planned closures of the ivivva stores, adjusted operating income for the quarter increased to approximately $258 million or 27.8% of net revenue.  Tax expense for the quarter was approximately $138 million or 53.5% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 31.1% a year ago. Tax expense included a onetime income tax expense of $59.3 million related to the recent U.S. tax reforms. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.6% versus 30.6% last year. Net income for the quarter was approximately $120 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.99 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in Q4 2017 included $59.3 million or $0.44 per share for the aforementioned U.S. Tax Reform and $1 million or $0.01 per share in after-tax ivivva-related charges. Excluding these charges, adjusted EPS was $1.33 per share compared to adjusted EPS of $1 last year.  Capital expenditures were approximately $51 million for the quarter compared to approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase relates primarily to higher investments in IT relative to last year. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $991 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $330 million or 10% higher than at the end of Q4 2016 and below our forward sales outlook. Based on improved efficiencies in our supply chain and the better planning capabilities that I mentioned earlier, we expect to use less airfreight in 2018 versus 2017. This will benefit product margin as our all-in, per-unit freight costs are expected to be lower due to the shift. As a result, we will be taking delivery earlier in the cycle relative to last year and we'll likely see inventories grow modestly in excess of sales in the first half of the year before moderating into the second half. To be clear, we have not altered our practices in managing inventory levels, and we are comfortable with how we are positioned for the year. Turning now to our outlook for the fiscal year 2018 and the first quarter. We're pleased with the start we're seeing to the year and the momentum building across the business. As a reminder, our guidance includes the 53rd week and reflects a modest benefit to sales and earnings for the year. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2,985,000,000 to $3,022,000,000. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid- to high single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open 40 to 50 company-operated lululemon stores in 2017. This includes 20 to 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low double digits. For the year, we expect gross margin to expand modesty, primarily driven by product margin improvement. We expect SG&A for the full year to also leverage modestly as we will not anniversary the onetime digital acceleration cost from 2017, and we realize efficiencies within our cost structure. We expect our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3 to $3.08. Our EPS guidance is based on 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our effective tax rate will decrease from 31% in 2017 to approximately 29% in 2018, reflecting our estimate of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Our estimate can change as we finalize our review of the additional interpretations and guidance. We've historically benefited from a relatively low tax rate due to the transfer pricing arrangements we have in place. And as such, we'll see only a modest reduction in our ECR this year. Furthermore, we will continue to analyze the impact of the U.S. tax reforms on our overall strategies for capital deployment. We have assumed the Canadian dollar at $0.78 to the U.S. dollar for 2018 as well as the first quarter. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $240 million to $250 million for the fiscal year 2018. The increase relative to 2017 reflects a ramp-up of our renovation and relocation program, increased store openings in international markets, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects.  For Q1, we expect revenues to be in the range of $612 million to $617 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double-digit range on a constant-dollar basis compared to the first quarter of 2017. This also assumes 8 new store openings in the quarter. We anticipate gross margin to increase by approximately 50 to 100 basis points versus Q1 of last year. Despite the strong increases in product margin last year that we are now anniversarying, we continue to see AUC opportunities, driven by our ongoing supply chain initiatives. We also expect to leverage SG&A in Q1 by 50 to 100 basis points as we gain efficiencies in our cost structure. Assuming a tax rate of 29% and 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 versus $0.32 a year ago. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : The traffic was very impressive. What are your thoughts on what has driven traffic? And also, as we look at the year ahead, what's kind of incorporated for your view on traffic? Would you expect it to be volatile? And just another question was on Big Data. Glenn, you mentioned in the beginning, I was just curious about how that will manifest with customer engagement, supply chain and how we should think about that opportunity as it applies to gross margins to over a longer time horizon. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Oliver. This is Stuart. So let me first address your question on traffic. So really pleased with the momentum that we've seen not only in Q4 but now into Q1. It's hard to overstate also the impact of the product assortment improvements that we've seen. Improved color palette, improved newness and style across the assortment has been really strong. It's also important that -- to note that guest acquisition strategies that we have been pursuing are driving traffic across both stores and e-commerce. As you look at it by channel, it's certainly -- in the store business, the traffic story is really what's driving the comps, and certainly, in e-commerce, it's a conversion story. So as we look at store traffic specifically, we saw total store traffic in Q4 was slightly positive across all regions. We saw sequential improvements across all regions as well in the fourth quarter and now, into the early part of the first quarter. So we're pleased with that traffic picture in general. And the things that I would point to that are driving that, certainly, the macro environment has improved to a degree but more importantly, we see the efforts in our digital marketing or omnichannel capabilities and the improvements that we've seen in driving increases in our e-mail file. These are driving, as I mentioned, traffic across both channels and continuing to see momentum in each of these into the first quarter. And from an e-commerce standpoint, the traffic story is important also but the conversion story is more pronounced. So just to mention briefly, the drivers there related to our website, improvements in load times, better navigation and more flexibility in how we can make changes to the website. So the traffic story is important across both channels and will continue, as I mentioned, into the first quarter as we continue to pursue those strategies. On your second question related to data analytics. As Glen mentioned, this is something that we're focused on. When we met with the board last week, it was one of the few priorities that we have been looking to build new capabilities and to complement our existing competitive advantages. Our approach is to bring data-driven insights into core decision-making across 3 areas : guest engagement, merchandising, general operations. So each of those 3 areas are where we're focusing leveraging data. So we're not as far along as we'd like to be in these areas. We're building a talented team. We've committed some significant resources this year to pursue this strategy. And we're seeing some nice early wins in our e-mail and digital marketing efforts. So this is something we look forward to sharing more with investors later in the year as our programs develop here. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. Brian Tunick : Two questions. I guess, Sun, maybe excited to hear about the women's tops and outerwear businesses turning the corner in Q4. Can you maybe talk about what's changed specifically in those 2 categories and how you're planning introductions in 2018 maybe versus 2017? And then, Stuart, maybe you can help us bridge the Q1 guidance on gross margin and SG&A, thanks for the help, to what we're coming up with for the full year? Where in the rest of the year maybe are you giving some of the margin expansion back? Sun Choe : Great. Thanks. This is Sun. I'll hit on your questions around tops and outerwear. In the case of tops, we really saw a nice turnaround based on our balance of color and pattern, which we spoke to earlier in the call. And I also think that from a portfolio standpoint, we have a really nice balance of core franchises and a variety of silhouettes that's really driving the turnaround in tops, and that is something that we continue to invest in go forward for Q1 and beyond for 2018. In outerwear specifically, we really doubled down on new innovation and waterproofed down for Q4, which really resonated well and created a nice halo for the overall category. And as we look into -- and I would also say that color showed up really well in outerwear, too. The year prior, I'd say, we probably mostly invested in really dark neutrals, and this year, we did offer lighter neutrals, which has been resonating well. It's also a trend that we continue to see going into Q1 in 2018 and beyond. And I would say, really can emphasize the innovation piece to both tops and outerwear as being a really nice halo for us in product. Stuart Haselden : And Brian, it's Stuart. Let me address your question on gross margin and SG&A for the year relative to our guidance. So we're pleased with the trends that we're seeing in the first quarter in both of these areas, but what I would call out is that the comparisons get generally tougher as we get into the balance of the year. And there are a couple of anomalies by quarter that are worth mentioning. In the second quarter, we will see some gross margin pressure related to occupancy where we have some specific real estate initiatives in the second quarter that will weigh on our gross margin leverage. And then, in the third quarter, there will be also SG&A pressure as we lap FX benefits from 2017. And we also have some timing related to certain strategic initiative, investments in the third quarter that will also pressure SG&A. So those account for some of the differences that we see by quarter. As we look past the first quarter into the balance of the year, these will effectively dampen the overall gross margin and SG&A rate improvements for the year. So those are the headlines I'd offer in terms of how the Q1 guidance connects to the full year guidance of gross margin and SG&A. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : If you broke down your 1Q and full year guide, I guess, what's the embedded growth for digital versus stores that you have within the comp guidance? And then, on the profitability side, how best to think about margins between these 2 channels, both today and also over time, given the growth of digital that you're seeing from a size and scale perspective? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Matt. Thanks for your question. So on the comp guidance, we're -- we obviously have more visibility on the first quarter, and we're excited on the momentum we're seeing there that we've talked about. And it's really across all parts of the business. We have the easiest comparisons, certainly, in the first quarter. The comparisons will get tougher into the balance of the year, especially given what we just reported for the fourth quarter. And as we think about how we will drive those comp results, certainly, we start with the product assortments and the improvements earlier in the year with regard to product -- I'm sorry, with regard to color and newness that we mentioned. But there's also strong channel tailwinds that we're seeing. We mentioned the traffic drivers and the conversion drivers. Those are both part of the story. And so we're -- so we feel good for the first quarter. And as you look at -- it's probably good to look at the comp picture on a 2-year basis. And you can see that there is some acceleration into the second half of the year with regards to the comp trajectory. And it's really -- I would point to the runway that we have between now and the second half of the year to develop some of the initiatives that we have more completely, whether it's just getting farther along in some of the product strategies, the community strategies, and just there's a number of colocated openings that will begin to ramp up into the second half of the year. So there's a number of things within just the channel strategies and the product strategies that will have a more full expression into the second half of the year that will benefit the comp trajectory. So those are the things I would point to in terms of trying to offer some dimensions by quarter. And then, as we look at your second question with regard to gross margins or margins by channel, overall, we feel great about the continued improvement that we see in product margins. We'll see some benefit in the first quarter with regard to leveraging occupancy and depreciation. That'll be muted into the later quarters of the year, and that's reflected in the guidance that we gave. As you think about margins by channel, certainly, e-commerce carries a higher operating profit margin that'll benefit and flow through to our EBIT margins. And certainly, as we over-index or drive faster growth in e-commerce, that'll be a good thing in terms of helping to leverage operating margins. And we really take an omnichannel approach to the business looking to engage guests where they choose to shop with us. Certainly, there's a lot of investments and effort around digital and e-commerce that is fueling the outsize growth trajectory that we have. That'll continue. So I think those are the comments I'd offer there. And we're pleased with how gross margins are shaping up, and we're pleased with our progress towards an EBIT margin that starts with the 2. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : A couple of quick ones. Just curious if you could maybe break out in which regions was store traffic positive. Was it in every region? Second, on CapEx number for this year, is that the new run rate that we should be thinking about in future years beyond '18? And then, last, I wonder if you could talk about the level of newness in the bottoms business this year versus last year? How much will you be relying on updates to your proven winners versus new launches on the bottom side of the business? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Paul. Let me try to tackle your first 2 questions first, and then I'll invite Sun to speak to the bottoms trend. Store comps by region were generally strong across the board. I would say, we saw particularly strong store trends in the Southeast in the fourth quarter, a little weaker comps in the Northeast. I think, weather was certainly a part of that. And in general, the trends in the U.S. were stronger than the trends in Canada. And within Canada, the Alberta region continues to be a softer area for us from a comp trend standpoint. And from a CapEx standpoint, we did see a significant increase in our plans for CapEx for the year, and that's really reflective of our growth strategy. So the store investments, not only in new stores but in our colocated projects, our international expansion, investments in technology to fuel our e-commerce and digital strategies and supply chain, we continue to evaluate investments in our distribution network to make sure that we are positioned in a very competitive manner with regard to how we're servicing our guests. So all those things are connecting to increased levels of investment that we believe will help us achieve our growth plans. Sun Choe : Thanks, Stuart. Paul, this is Sun. In response to your question on newness in bottoms, overall, we really like to look at our total portfolio of bottoms to make sure that we have enough in the idea of seating, which is really where newness comes in. And so while I don't really want to give a number that says we try to target x percentage, we do just want to make sure, from a portfolio standpoint, that we do have enough seating that drives newness to the assortment. Paul Lejuez : And Stuart, on that CapEx, is that -- is it a one-time increase this year? Or is that a right number you'll be using in future years? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Paul. I think it's a good number to use. I wouldn't -- I'm reluctant to say that's the right number to use for subsequent years. There were some particular technology investments that we had this year that we won't necessarily repeat into following years, but it's not a bad number. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Stuart, my question is on e-com. In the prior year, you had reported an e-com EBIT margin that was about 1,700 basis points higher, kind of in that 40% range. And then, the stores are already really productive, from an EBIT perspective, mid-20s. Can you talk about that differential there? Where that extra, call it, 1,700 basis points is coming from? And then, as you grow that e-com channel, do you get gross margin pressure at that top line or at the gross margin line offset then in the EBIT line? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Adrienne. So I mean, the simple answer on the e-com is that we don't have rent or store payroll, which is the big items in the cost structure that distinguish the 2 channels. We have seen pressure on a year-over-year basis with the e-com P&L contribution related to increases in digital marketing, and we're comfortable with that. We're viewing it or we're seeing that as an important vehicle to acquire new guests. So we're investing aggressively in digital marketing. And as I mentioned in my opening -- in the opening question, that's an important part of how we are driving traffic across the company broadly. The gross margin profiles are largely the same. We do -- as you're aware, we have been leveraging the website as a clearance vehicle. And we -- and by virtue of having the ship from store ability to connect the store clearance to the website is a very efficient and profitable way for us to clear excess inventory. So that does flow through the e-com P&L as well. But in general, the gross margin profiles are comparable between the channels. It's really the cost structures that are different. And the year-over-year pressure that I mentioned on digital marketing is notable as well. We expect that, that structure, that sort of margin structure, P&L structure, will continue. There's no reason not to expect that. And as we increase the percentage or penetration of our e-commerce business, it's a benefit to the overall company EBIT. So I hope that offers some color on your question there. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes. Definitely. Can you -- just 2 housekeeping question. 53rd week, how should we think about that for fourth quarter of this coming year? And then, on the transfer pricing, is there an opportunity to do, I guess, the reverse inversion and bring back the EBIT back to the States now that the attach rate here is lower? Stuart Haselden : Yes. On the 53rd week, there's about just over a $40 million revenue impact in the fourth quarter, and that connects to about a $0.01 to $0.02 impact in earnings. And really, that's a result of this falling -- that week falling into a markdown -- a higher markdown period for the fourth quarter. So that's really the impact of the 53rd week. And on the tax rate question, there is more flexibility now, obviously, with the repatriation. We'll be evaluating the current structure into the future and taking this as an opportunity to take a look at it. Right now, the tax rate, the new tax rate in the U.S. versus Canada is essentially on par, so there's really no reason to make any changes to the transfer pricing agreements, but we'll certainly be taking a look at, going forward, what makes most sense in terms of our cash disposition. Operator : Our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : [indiscernible] quarter, Glenn [indiscernible] ask you guys about e-commerce business [indiscernible] it's a pretty miraculous turnaround from where you were a year ago. Maybe the improved functionality and investments you've made. Maybe elaborate what's going on over there, without giving away your secret sauce? It's obviously having a huge material impact on the overall business and trying to figure out how much more there is to go for the business from that standpoint? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Thanks, Omar. On the -- on our e-com business, it's been quite a journey from the first quarter, as Glenn had mentioned. There was a very quick response, and we're able to begin making improvements throughout 2017. And really, the improvements that we made in the second quarter and the third quarter were more process-related and things that were less technology-dependent. We certainly began immediately improving photography and some of the digital merchandising elements of the website in the second and third quarters. But I would say, more importantly, how the teams were working together was the most important factor. We broke down the silos, if you will, between merchandising, brand, e-com operations and technology and created a very cross-functional team that worked in a different manner. And so that led to better decision-making, faster decision-making. And we also identified early in the year the technology impediments that we had with the existing website, and we commissioned work with Deloitte, and we talked about last year as well where we essentially had the front end of the website rewritten with Deloitte's help. We then integrated that in the third quarter and launched the new website at the end of the third quarter. And so you saw those process and sort of low-hanging fruit steps in second and third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, the inflection that we just reported was related to the new website. And we're pleased with all the hard work that our teams put into making that happen. We launched that website just shortly before peak season into the fourth quarter and really had no interruptions in the business. So it's a pretty remarkable achievement. But as you look at the website and the improvements that we had in the fourth quarter, I mentioned a few of those in that opening question, but it was really related to performance, faster load times, better navigation, visual merch that I just mentioned. There's a more intuitive interface in how the site shops. There were some checkout optimization, not a lot. And now -- but the most important factor that we fixed in the current version of the website was just creating a more flexible format where we can make changes to the website in hours or days where it used to take us weeks or months even. So there are some big issues that we're able to address with that update to the website. And as we look forward into 2018, we have some important projects teed up that will continue to drive conversion. And all the things I just mentioned have really been focused on driving improvements in conversion on the site. But this year, later this year, we will have a big effort around checkout as well as search and personalization. And so those enhancements will benefit and fuel further improvements in conversion and performance on the site into 2018. Then you combine that with the big investments that we made in digital marketing to drive traffic, you get a pretty powerful outcome from an e-commerce standpoint. So we would agree, it's been a remarkable turnaround, and there's a lot more in front of us in terms of how we're going to drive that business into 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird Capital. Mark Altschwager : I guess, this dovetails a bit into the discussion you just had in there. But on the data analytics and CRM project, I think you characterized the efforts that's catching up. And early last year, when you realized you fell behind in digital, you caught up quickly, you filled SG&A higher but really paid off on the top line. So I guess, is there an opportunity to take similarly aggressive action to catch up quickly on the CRM and omnichannel capability fronts? Just curious how you're thinking about that? And whether that might need some acceleration in spending plans as -- in CRM as you build that team out this year? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. So it is a big focus. We are seeing benefits in the guest aspect of how we're applying data to drive the business. We're getting smarter in how we're being able to engage our guest via e-mail and other social media. And so I would say, we're going to see that benefit the business from a guest acquisition and retention standpoint. We think we can scale that. We can amplify it as we get smarter and have stronger capabilities in data analytics. There are some foundational investments that we need to make in technology that will help us be able to amplify that to a greater degree. Those investments are underway and part of the plans that we talked about, certainly, in the CapEx and the expense plans that we've outlined. We feel like we can drive this new capability with the financial resources that are reflected in the guidance. So we're not expecting. There's some new one-time project that we have to commit the company to that we'll need to share outside of the expense guidance we just offered. So we feel good about the amount of resources we have to drive that particular initiative. And the focus has initially been around our guest and our CRM capabilities. We will then extend that effort into merchandising and channel optimization, as I mentioned. And it's a big focus, and we're recruiting here. We've recruited some key leaders that'll help us build that strategy internally and bring new expertise that we didn't have before. And as I mentioned, we're going to make important investments in the infrastructure to support it. So look forward to sharing more with you guys as we go through the year and we make progress against those goals. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Just 2 questions. Just the performance of the seasonal pop-ups you guys had this holiday, just kind of curious, can you let us know what kind of revenue that generated, what your plans are maybe this year in terms of pop-ups during the holiday? Do you to plan to accelerate the 24 that you did in Q4? And then, Stuart, just a quick one, can you maybe quantify the benefits on the gross margin line that you hope to see from the strategy that you laid out to improve the freight costs this year just kind of like -- just look at that one piece of the gross margin? Just curious. Stuart Haselden : Yes, Ike. On the seasonal pop-ups, really happy with how those performed. I think, we did 20... Sun Choe : 24. Stuart Haselden : 24 in fourth quarter, and we had -- we'll more than double that into 2018. And there was a number of those that we've actually kept open into the first quarter based on the strong performance that we saw. Of the 24 that we did, I think, all but 4 or 5 actually beat plan and were very successful. We are not going to quantify the sales impact, but you could probably get to a good estimate, just given the number that we have and using some of the averages that you might expect from a typical Lulu store. And the -- so the other thing I would say about the seasonal is that it's as much a guest acquisition vehicle for us as it is a sales driver. And Celeste mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had about 40% of our guests that shopped with us in the seasonal stores were new to the brand. So that was an important element for us as well. And the general philosophy is there are a lot of locations where we may not want to have a store year-round, but in the holiday season, it's still a relevant place to operate and to capture demand. So it's a good addition to the array of store formats that we have to employ. And then, on your gross margin question, the benefit is going to be sort of reflected in what we said in the gross margin guidance broadly. That is going to be one of a few factors that will benefit product margin and help us deliver that modest improvement for the overall year. We're not going to break it out specifically, but it's meaningful. It's related to reductions in the airfreight that I mentioned. We had previously offered a target for airfreight around 25% of our total mode, and we think we can do better than that in certain periods in a year. So I think that's as much that we're going to be able to say on that specific item, but we appreciate your question. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. I would now like to hand the call back over to Howard Tubin for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks for joining, everybody. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you in about 3 months when we report our first quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating. Have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me to talk about our results are Glenn Murphy, Executive Chairman, who's joining us via telephone; and Stuart Haselden, COO. We are also joined today by PJ Guido, our new CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.  Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Murphy : Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everybody. I was thinking today as I was preparing for this call, I went on to our website where you can find an infographic of our Q1 results. And the comment I made on the last conference call of laminating Q4's performance was clearly premature. If you read that on our website, you'll see that our revenue was up 25%. I mean, that really speaks to the deepening engagement with existing guests, but equally important, as we invest in digital marketing, how much we've grown our customer acquisition, whether that's in our e-mail file or bringing people in through our app or through the website organically. I mean, our gross margin expansion was greater than 250 basis points. We're a premium brand, but that is still a phenomenal performance. And that really is our -- that's all about product. That's the design team, the merchant team and the supply team working together in a coordinated fashion to produce that kind of result on the gross margin line. We were able to achieve SG&A leverage of 130 basis points. And the business and the leadership team understands we have a growth business here, 25% in the first quarter, growth that is. So we know we have to make investments to drive growth and improve our business. But at the same time, we're committed to looking for efficiencies, and that's where that performance comes through on the SG&A line. When you put that together, first quarter performance on earnings per share was an improvement of greater than 70% versus last year. Now our management team is keenly aware that last year's first quarter results were below the standard we set for ourselves and what this brand can actually deliver quarter in, quarter out. But if you combine it together and look at it, whether it's 2-year way or more whether you look at it stacked, or when you put the 2 quarters together, I mean, all key indicators were very positive, whether that's categories, channels or geographies.  Now we've been looking at this year, a general look at the first quarter and our performance to date, which Stuart will talk about, in the second quarter, we know we're operating inside of a good global consumer economy, and the athletic sector continues to benefit from really strong macro trends. This is not the athleisure trend, which is a trend inside of the larger macro trend, but which is benefiting our performance and really the entire sector, which is health and wellness. Even that aside, when you look -- with that as a backdrop, I mean, the last 3 quarters have been a stepped-up performance for lululemon when it comes to market share gains, and that's market share gains in our stores and in e-commerce.  So for me, as I spend time with the team as an interim appointment as Executive Chairman, the board wants to make sure that the management team just continues to push the business forward. And if you look at Q1 -- if you look at Q4, clearly, the data points are that this is indeed happening. And the 3 leaders we have and the people who work alongside of them are definitely pushing the company and challenging everybody inside the business to move forward. And the other part that's important noting for our investors and shareholders and analysts on the phone today, I just came back from a week in Vancouver. And I was sort of looking for signs of possible complacency or overconfidence, and I can tell you nobody in Vancouver or in our stores, our distribution centers or our offices around the world, nobody's doing a victory lap. I mean, there's a senior management team who are heads down, executing on the 2018 strategic initiatives to take our business to a whole other level. I thought I'd just pause for a second and give you an update on the CEO search. I mean, it's progressing well. We've met with a number of candidates who are both qualified and interested. The whole board is together next week, and at that time, we will be discussing the candidates who have come forward and really getting agreement on how do we take this to the next level and to a whole another phase of the search, which is more getting closer to completion than trying to find who are the right candidates. I think we can now take this search to the next step. Let me close off by saying on behalf of the Board of Directors, I really want to thank Celeste, Stuart and Sun for their stellar leadership over the past 4 months. I mean, personally, I've thoroughly enjoyed working with them and mostly watching them lead our over 13,000 employees and educators who each in their own way have contributed to this latest surge in guest engagement and to the company's overall performance.  With that said, let me pass the call over to Stuart, who will take you through more detail on our Q1 2018 performance. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Glenn. Let me reiterate how pleased we are with the performance in Q1. We are successfully executing on our strategies and seeing consistent results across several key parts of the business that are now extending into Q2 and further setting the stage for us to achieve our 2020 goals. While much work remains to be done, we are finding success in driving traffic and conversion increases at both stores and online across diverse geographies. Importantly, the supply chain and technology infrastructure investments we've made over the last few years offer us a stable platform to grow and scale the business globally. And what I'd like our investors to hear is that the success we are seeing now is not merely the lapping of weak prior year comparisons. What we are seeing is important momentum across the core areas of our business in channel, product and guest engagement. This momentum reflects the structural long-term investments that we've made and continue to make to drive the comp and noncomp revenue increases that are enabling us to deliver on our multiyear plans. We would further offer that our current results are a validation of these strategies, and we now have even more opportunity to accelerate these investments in the areas that hold the greatest potential. Let me offer a few highlights from Q1 that illustrate what I'm talking about.  First, in channel, we saw our investments in our website and mobile capabilities deliver e-commerce conversion increases of 20%. This was further amplified by traffic increases of 30% that were driven by our improved product assortments and digital marketing efforts. Within our stores, this was the second quarter in a row of positive store traffic, which increased in the mid-single-digit range and drove the overall comp results. And we continue to expand our international footprint with store openings in key markets, including Berlin and Seoul. Next, within product, we posted double-digit positive comp increases in our core businesses for both men and women. Bras and accessories achieved double-digit comp growth as well while also accelerating meaningfully versus Q4.  And finally, in guest engagement, we saw continued success in our community and digital strategies, which contributed to a 28% increase in guest acquisition in the quarter, fueling traffic gains across both stores and e-commerce. These efforts combine to deliver a strong financial result for the first quarter with total revenue growing 25% to $650 million, our combined comps and dollar comp increasing 19%, with stores rising 6% and e-commerce up 60%, gross margin increasing 270 basis points versus adjusted gross margin last year as we saw both product margin expansion and leverage on our occupancy costs. And we are able to leverage SG&A by 130 basis points. These results contributed to a 16% operating margin and EPS of $0.55 or 72% growth versus the same period last year. Given this continued progress, we are confident in our plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year, which is reflected in our updated guidance.  Looking to the future, we remain firmly on track to achieve our ambition of $4 billion in revenue in 2020. As previously mentioned, the path we're taking to achieve this goal includes product innovation across categories with significant opportunity remaining in men's in particular, expanding the lululemon footprint in both North America and our international markets and continuing to accelerate our digital business. Let me now offer some color on our progress within each of these growth pillars in Q1 and looking forward. We're excited about our product pipeline as we continue to drive category-defining innovation and solve problems for athletes. Some examples include our recently developed Out of Mind short liner in men's made from a lightweight, breathable mesh. This improved liner construction is now offered in our 3 core short styles : Surge,  Pace Breaker and the T.H.E. short, which are all performing extremely well now into Q2. We launched our City Sweat franchise for men, which includes a collection of hoodies and joggers made from our technical French Terry fabric. Guests responded well to this collection in Q1, and this paves the way for further opportunities in our office travel commute category for men's.  For women, building on the success of Enlite, we see a compelling opportunity in the bra category. We're developing new styles with varying levels of support to broaden our overall assortment. In Q1, we launched the Speed Up Bra featuring a new molded technology, and we have additional styles ready to introduce later this year. We're also excited about our upcoming Embrace Movement collection. This will be a technically driven line of bottoms for women and men offering zone compression, fully leveraging our ongoing work as part of the science of feel. Expect to hear more about this in the fall when we launch the line. Shifting now to our North American stores. We posted another strong quarter with comps up 6%, driven by an accelerating traffic trend versus Q4. And we're happy to see this trend continuing now into Q2, reflecting our momentum in guest acquisition and in-store conversions. Our stores remain among the most productive in apparel retail, which is the direct result of the passion of our educators, our innovative product assortments, agile store formats and connection to our communities. In a moment, I'll discuss our digital business in more detail, but first, I want to say that a big part of our recent success has been our omnichannel focus on serving our guests and our ability to leverage this across channels. We continue to expand in this regard, with ship from store now available in nearly 300 locations. And we remain on track to begin the rollout of buy online, pick up in-store during the second half of the year. Switching now to our business outside of North America where we are still in the early innings of one of our most important growth strategies. Asia continues to lead the way for us, and in Q1, we saw combined comps over 50%, which results in China particularly strong. We successfully opened our third and fourth stores in Seoul, Korea with the most recent opening in the iconic Lotte World Mall. We continue to expect to open 15 to 20 stores in Asia in 2018 and also plan to launch a local e-commerce site in Korea later this year. In Europe, we saw strong growth as well with double-digit comps exceeding our plans. And in addition to the recent store openings in Berlin and Frankfurt, we added to our presence in the U.K. with a new store in Guildford outside of London.  And finally, I'd like to speak to the exciting progress we're seeing in our digital and e-commerce business. We posted e-commerce comps of 60% on a constant-dollar basis in Q1, driven by strong increases in traffic and conversion. While our comparisons get more difficult in each subsequent quarter in 2018, we are pleased to see strong momentum extending into Q2. Looking at traffic, our digital teams are driving high-quality web and mobile traffic leveraging our e-mail file growth, improving our targeting capabilities and seeing more returned guests. A few stats I'd like to highlight here. Our e-mail file nearly doubled in the quarter. Direct marketing-related traffic to our site increased by more than 60%. And we saw an increase of over 50% in transactions made by existing guests. And as we are finding success in driving higher traffic levels, we're also delivering a better online experience for our guests. We've elevated the overall guest experience with better landing pages, enhanced content and improved navigation and merchandising. We see additional opportunities in this area in the near term. For example, we began streamlining the checkout process in Q1 with further progress planned into Q2 and Q3. And as I said on the last call, we are starting to bring data-driven insights into our core decision-making across the business, but particularly within the digital channel. We're currently developing and rolling out more sophisticated and automated tools, which will allow us to take mobile, search, browse, e-mail and the post-purchase experience to new levels. So overall, we're pleased with our e-commerce results and see progress building towards our strategic goals for this part of the business. A key enabler of our growth and continued guest engagement are the brand activations and events we host in our markets around the world. Building on our strong brand momentum, in Q1, we celebrated International Women's Day through events in key cities around the globe, including Washington, D.C., Melbourne and London. In Q2, to further engage with our run-focused guests, we are sponsoring 10-K races in Toronto and Edmonton, which sold out in less than 24 hours after registration opened. And earlier this month, I'm excited to announce that we launched our 360-degree run-focused campaign, Let Your Mind Run Free. And as you know, one of the hallmarks of our company is our investment in people. We have a long-standing commitment to leadership development, and we continue to roll out programs and experiences for all employees that bring to life the unique aspects of the lululemon culture. Last year, we made a commitment to achieve pay equity for women and men across our organization by the end of 2018. Nearly 80% of our workforce is comprised of women, and we knew this was simply the right thing to do. I'm proud to report that last month, 9 months ahead of schedule, we delivered on this commitment and will maintain this standard moving forward. This puts us in a leadership position among companies across industries. Now before I share the specific details of our financial performance, it's my pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, PJ Guido. Some of you may be familiar with PJ given his 15 years of prior experience leading various finance functions at Fortune 500 retail organizations. I'll ask him to say a few words now. PJ, welcome. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Stuart, and a warm hello to all those on the call today. I cannot express how energized I am to be joining such a powerful brand and talented team here at lululemon. I look forward to engaging with our investors and many of you on the phone as well in the coming months. So far, I've spent the last few weeks immersed in the business and getting to know the teams across the company. I have even pulled several store shifts, and I can tell you they are absolutely pulsing with energy and excitement. I look forward to working with Stuart, the entire leadership team with those of you in the analyst and investor community. And now I will turn it back to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, PJ. Before I speak to our financials, I'd also like to thank Glenn for his guidance and strategic counsel, and in particular, Celeste and Sun for their partnership during this important time at the company. And speaking for the 4 of us, we want to thank our educators around the world for everything they do to bring lululemon to their guests every day.  I'll now offer some highlights on Q1, but please see the financial supplement posted on our investor site for additional details. As I mentioned earlier, total net revenue rose 25% to $650 million with the increase in revenue resulting from strong performance across all parts of the business. Our store channel delivered a 6% comp store sales increase on top of a 1% decline in Q1 last year. And in e-commerce, we posted a 60% comp increase. lululemon branded store square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 48 net new lululemon stores since Q1 of 2017. And the impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by $9 million in the quarter. Gross profit for the first quarter is $344.7 million or 53.1% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 50.4% of net revenue in Q1 2017. The gross profit rate in Q1 increased 270 basis points versus adjusted gross margin last year. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter, with the primary driver being a 120 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from favorability in product mix, lower product costs and lower markdowns versus last year. I'm particularly pleased that this increase comes on top of a 380 basis point improvement in product margin last year. We continue to see opportunities to gain cost efficiencies within our supply chain, enabled by several ongoing strategies across sourcing and distribution. In addition, we realized 120 basis points of leverage on occupancy and depreciation and product and supply chain SG&A as a result of the strong top line results. We also saw 30 basis points favorable impact related to foreign exchange in the quarter. SG&A expenses were just over $240 million or 37% of net revenue compared to 38.3% of net revenue for the same period last year. We're pleased that we are able to deliver leverage above the high end of our expectations. More efficient spend in both our SSC and store channel, coupled with leverage from higher-than-planned sales, generated approximately 290 basis points of leverage. This was partially offset by 160 basis points related to foreign exchange, with the majority of deleverage due to the lapping of FX gains in the prior period last year. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $104 million or 16.1% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 12.1% of net revenue in Q1 2017. Tax expense for the quarter was approximately $32 million or 29.9% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 32.6% a year ago. Our tax rate came in 90 basis points higher than we initially expected due to refinements in our estimates under the recent U.S. tax reforms. Normalized for charges related to last year's ivivva restructuring, the adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 2017 was 30.8%. Net income for the quarter was approximately $75.2 million or $0.55 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.23 for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding charges related to the ivivva restructuring, adjusted EPS in Q1 2017 was $0.32. Capital expenditures were approximately $34 million for the quarter compared to approximately $20 million in the first quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to new store renovations and relocation capital. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $967 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $373 million or 23% higher than at the end of Q1 2017.  Now turning to our updated outlook for the fiscal year 2018 and our outlook for the second quarter. And as a reminder, 2018 is a 53-week year for us. For the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.04 billion to $3.075 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the high single-digit range on a constant dollar basis. We continue to expect to open 40 to 50 company-operated lululemon stores in 2018. This includes 20 to 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low double digits. For the year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand modestly, primarily driven by product margin improvement and leverage on occupancy and other fixed costs. We continue to expect SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly as we realize efficiencies within our cost structure. As you think about SG&A for the full year, please recall my comments from the Q4 call regarding our expectation for SG&A pressure in Q3. We plan to make certain discrete investments that will create some SG&A headwind in the quarter. We now expect our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.18. Our EPS guidance is based on 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2018. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance of 29% and is a result of the previously mentioned refinements under the U.S. tax reforms. We are continuing to analyze the impact of the changes to the U.S. tax code, including how this affects our overall strategies for capital deployment. We have assumed the Canadian dollar at $0.765 to the U.S. dollar for 2018 as well as Q2. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $240 million to $250 million for the fiscal year 2018. The increase relative to 2017 reflects a ramp-up of our renovation and relocation program, increased store openings in international markets, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects. For Q2, we expect revenues to be in the range of $660 million to $665 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the high single-digit range on a constant-dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2017. This also assumes 3 new store openings in the quarter. We anticipate gross margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points versus Q2 of last year. Despite the strong increases in product margin last year that we're now anniversary-ing, we continue to see AUC opportunities, driven by our ongoing supply chain initiatives. We expect to leverage SG&A in Q2 by approximately 50 basis points as we continue to gain efficiencies in our cost structure. Assuming a tax rate of 30% and 136.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.48 versus adjusted EPS of $0.39 a year ago. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Yes, everyone, and welcome, PJ. Doing a bang-up job so far. So I guess, Stuart, my first question, just high-level, trying to understand the doubling in the e-mail file. That seems to be a pretty monumental accomplishment this quarter, given that your e-mail file was pretty large to begin with. Can you give us a sense for how much of that was international versus how much of that is North America? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Matt. The e-mail file trajectory has really been exciting and important. The mix of that is largely weighted towards North America. And the reason we've seen an inflection in it is we implemented new applications within our POS system in the third quarter of last year with new training for our store educators to be able to be armed in a better way with technology and training to capture guest e-mails at point-of-sale. And so that has been a big part of the inflection in how we have increased the e-mail capture rate. That has then been complemented by the improvements in the website that were a part of the relaunch at the end of the third quarter last year. So the combination of the improvements in the website and the improvements in the point-of-sale execution in-store has really been what's been driving that inflection and acceleration in the e-mail capture rate. So we'll lap that, some of those changes really as we get into the fourth quarter of this year, and we have initiatives beyond that to continue to fuel increases in how we're capturing e-mails with our guests. Matthew McClintock : Perfect. And then if I could, just a follow-up question. You talked about new markets, Berlin, or new stores, Berlin and Seoul. If I recall, you probably have a couple of stores in the comp base in South Korea and also in Germany by now. And you talk about Asia comping up 50%. Can you kind of give us a sense of how stores perform as they roll over in those 2 specific markets? Because I assume the up 50% comp in Asia is primarily China. Stuart Haselden : Well, the performance across Asia has been really strong. We have some really strong store locations in other markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore, Tokyo. But certainly, we have the greatest number of stores now in China with the greatest amount of new store openings happening in China. So we're seeing strong comp performance across all those regions in Asia. The store locations in Seoul that we opened, we're very excited to reach additional guests in that particular market. We think it's an important market across Asia and important for us to show up strong in Seoul. Similarly, as we look at Europe, Berlin is an important city in Germany. As we think about the countries where we're focused in Europe, certainly, Germany, France and the U.K. are on top of the list, and so it's important for us to have a good foot forward and have some locations there that represent the brand and help build brand awareness. So I'm pleased with how all those stores have opened and the trajectory that they're on. And as we've mentioned, the Asia stores have been off to a faster start in general, but we're pleased with the progress we're making in Europe. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : So as we think about lulu as a dual-gender global brand, I guess, versus the $4 billion 2020 revenue target, maybe Stuart, is there any way to just kind of speak to where you're tracking maybe versus plan on some of the key pieces, online, men's, international? That would be helpful. Stuart Haselden : Absolutely. We are very excited at the progress we're making against those 2020 goals that we had laid out. I would say that overall, we're on track, if not a little bit ahead, versus those plans. And you might recall, we set those goals over 2 years ago. And as you might expect, we're farther ahead in certain areas than others. Right now, what I would say is in our -- within our men's business and within e-commerce, we are running ahead of schedule, and I think that's reflected in the most recent performance that we just announced. International, I would say it's taking a little longer than planned. Asia specifically is accelerating ahead of plan and ahead of schedule, but Europe is taking a little bit longer. And we are assuming a very deliberate approach in Europe, but we're pleased with the double-digit comps that exceeded our budget in the first quarter for Europe. So we're pleased with the trajectory overall, and that we're confident that we're going achieve that $4 billion number as we had set it out. But the pieces and parts of how we get there might be a little different than we had originally envisioned. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up. On the store front, so clearly, material runway on the international side. I guess, could you touch on remaining opportunity that you see in North America, maybe both in terms of sales productivity catalysts as well as store saturation versus some of the legacy management targets that you've laid out? I think it's been a couple of years now. Stuart Haselden : Yes, we see a lot of opportunity in North America. And in 2018, we'll actually execute more real estate projects than in any other prior year. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to see a 14% increase in global square footage. We're going to see a healthy number of new store projects in North America. What's more exciting is some of the innovation that we've seen from our North American store team. Specifically, the co-located strategy has been very important success, not only for extending the square footage runway that we have in North America, but also creating an important expansion of the retail guest experience that makes space for us to grow our men's business, to add new categories potentially such as shoes. So those new categories, we couldn't fit into a 3,000-square-foot box. And so that co-located strategy becomes really important more than just growing square footage, but creating that opportunity to expand the vision of our -- of what product categories we're able to execute in a physical environment. Beyond that, the seasonal store strategy has been a very strong success story for us. We did 24 of those in 2017. Nine of those locations we kept into this year and are pursuing for permanent -- as permanent locations, and we're seeing really strong performance out of those locations. So we continue to find ways to innovate our store model in North America. We really can't think of the business in that regard. It's just a static store count number off of a sort of a uniformed store layout. It's very dynamic, and we're exploring even now and into next year new experiential strategies as part of that physical experience for our guests. So we're really excited at what's -- what the team has been able to bring to the table. And in many ways, we feel like we're just getting started. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Tunick : I guess, you mentioned footwear before, but it's obviously a much bigger idea for your athletic peers versus lululemon. So curious how footwear is doing. And could footwear be one of the pillars for the company beyond 2020? And then the second question, in the shorter term, maybe Stuart, talk about the second half gross margin outlook. What are some of the puts and takes that we should be thinking about in your guidance? Stuart Haselden : Sure. On the footwear, Brian, it's, I guess, premature to call that as the major growth opportunity for us. We've been pleased with the tests that we've done with APL, and I think we've learned a lot from it. We learned that our guest is interested in buying shoes from us. That's one of the things we learned. We've also been able to develop an understanding of how to sell shoes in our stores, and in particular, where we don't carry inventory, how to execute the showrooming model. So we feel like that's a learning we can take into other categories that will make -- that will open the door for us to accomplish different things from an inventory management standpoint across a number of categories. So we've learned a lot from footwear. We're pleased with how it's performing. We're looking for opportunities to expand it even with our relationship with APL. And it's an open strategy for us to explore as we step into the future. And then on your second question with regard to the gross margin outlook for the second half, we're really pleased with the results that we've seen. The beat that we saw in the first quarter really came from the outperformance in mix and the lower markdowns. So we feel confident with the gross margin and product margin outlook that we offered. To the extent that mix and markdowns come in more favorably, there is an opportunity for us to do better. But we believe that the guidance that we provided is appropriate based on what we know at this point. And more broadly, I'm really pleased with just the journey we've seen with product margins. Much of the low-hanging fruit that we had talked about back in 2015 has been captured. We now focus on driving our segment and supply chain strategy, which will continue to help us capture AUC improvements. And we're now also shifting our attention from a supply chain standpoint to speed and to how do we reduce -- how we can reduce lead times and create new strategic flexibility in our business from a supply chain standpoint. And we're also exploring new exciting efforts to capture cost efficiencies in our distribution network, specifically how we fulfill e-com orders in North America. So we're really looking at our supply chain end-to-end and finding opportunities. And the combination of all this really connects to a multi-year road map for gross margin improvement that we see extending at least until 2020 and is contemplated in our long-range guidance that we shared previously. Operator : Our next question is from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: So I guess, Stuart, my first question is when you're doing sort of market research on international pieces of business, what do you do in terms of marketing, laying the groundwork? And then do you do any changes to the product? And then, Glenn, for you, it's been a year since you joined, and the business is completely different today. I was wondering if you can just look back on the past year, the biggest opportunity, the biggest change that you think has been made to the business. And then go forward in the next 2 years, to that 2020 target, what the next biggest leg of opportunity still remains. Stuart Haselden : Adrienne, it's Stuart. Why don't I address the first 2 questions that you directed my way? Then what we can -- we can have Glenn join us for the next part of it. But the international market entry, we certainly do research for each trade area, for each market. And the showroom model that we execute follows that market research. One of the key indicators that we look at is the e-commerce penetration that we see, that gives us an indication of the overall brand awareness and latent demand within each market. And so that's an important data point for us. But certainly, there are other factors that we consider, not only in international markets, but any market we enter. And so the showrooming model gives us an opportunity to feed demand, to build awareness, to develop those communities in a proven way that has proved -- that has, in fact, proven very resilient and a good indicator of where we are ready to open a store. So that model, we continue to execute. And from a product standpoint, tailoring products for the international markets, for the most part, it is a global assortment. Our regional merchants help tailor just the shape of the buy, if you will, for regional taste. We are exploring a limited number of Asia-only fits, that's a very small initial step. But as I said, for the most part, it's a global assortment. Let me pause there and see if Glenn would like to respond to your second question. Glenn Murphy : Thanks, Stuart. Yes, my view is that -- not to give you a history lesson because you all know the business well, but a year ago, the management team was just finishing some of the blocking and tackling work that they needed to get done as the new team and new talent got injected into the business and complemented the talent we had already inside the company. So you know all the work that was done, whether it's on the inventory side or the supply chain side. And I think that was work that needed to be done because trying to build something off a weak foundation is just not smart. So I give the management and the board credit for trying to sequence them properly. And in the last 12 months, as that work's been -- it's never completed. There's always, as Stuart said earlier, there's more we can do on some of those line items that the management team was focused on for about 24 months. Here come new category initiatives, which have been helpful, focused on digital and part of new categories expansion of men's, which has been a big win for the business, starting to open up our thought process on what could this brand become internationally. We can't just take our North American business and think we can transplant it into Asia, into Europe. You certainly take a culture and what the company stands for and the heartbeat of lululemon. That is nonnegotiable. That has to go around the world. But how we show up in parts of Asia, as you've heard Stuart reference some countries earlier, what are we going to do in Europe? It's opening up international. So those 3 fronts are part of this 2020 plan. I really give the management team and the board credit for how it was sequenced. And then looking forward, not to get too, ambitious, I think we're now committed to the 2020 plan, I think, what Stuart opened up a little bit in some of his commentary. What I really like about the management team, and especially the 3 leaders I've been working with, is we do spend time in Vancouver beyond looking at this quarter 2018 and the 2020 plan. There has been some time invested. Where to from here? What else can the brand become? That's not for today. Adrienne, that will be for another day. That won't be me, but it will be somebody else who articulated to shareholders and investors once we figure out what that is. But we do know we've got a special brand that can do a lot more than just its current gross margin success of the products in which we sell and the guest engagement that we developed. We know there's something more the business can do, but that's -- again, that's not for today but we've had some preliminary conversations about what that next step and act could be for lululemon. And I'm sure the management team will fill in the people on the phone at the appropriate time once we have that figure out. Operator : Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : The lower markdowns were also impressive. What are your thoughts on how that can be sustained? And also the other -- the related topic is your thoughts on the state of inventory and supply chain planning and allocation as there could be some opportunities to make sure that the assortments are right, in the right stores. The other follow-up I have is just about product innovation and what we should think about for the back half in your pants business. The zone compression sounds like a big idea, too. How would you prioritize the innovation factors around product? Stuart Haselden : Oliver, thank you. It's -- the lower markdown part of the story in Q1 was really great to see. The level of full-priced markdowns, I  think, reflects the health of the business and the success that we're having executing, not only on the product side, but just in our channel execution as well. So that is putting us in a great place where we can continue to drive a very healthy full-priced business. We see that continuing into Q2 and to the balance of the year, and that's reflected in the guidance that we offered. From an inventory standpoint, very comfortable with the inventory position, the composition of it. It's very current. As we had mentioned on the Q4 call, we do expect to see some higher inventory balances in the first half of the year and in Q1 and Q2 before seeing it moderate into the second half of the year. Even with that, we're very comfortable with the inventory balances that we currently are seeing. And from a product innovation standpoint and the product innovation pipeline, that is a critical part of our broader strategy. That is something that we remain focused on as an organization, our Whitespace team, our design team, bringing newness and innovation to market that matters to our guests. And so you've seen some of that innovation from several key programs last year that we have yet to lap into this year with the ABC pant new style introductions in Q3, with the Everlux fabric introduction in the second half of last year. The ever -- and the Enlite Bra success that we've seen and continue to ramp that opportunity into 2018 and complement it with additional styles. The bra category in particular is one where we see a lot of opportunity. You're going to see new styles into the second half of the year as well as new in-store execution that -- and we view bras as a strategic part of our women's business and how we'll grow the penetration of our tops -- women's tops business. So that's certainly a focus for us. And the other things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks in terms of the zone compression is another product area that we see a lot of potential, and we're excited to introduce that later in the fall. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : A couple of questions on men's. Can you maybe talk about the men's business and the growth that you're seeing by region? Also, penetration by region, I'd be curious about. And also, what percent of the new customers that you talk about are men versus women? Stuart Haselden : Yes. We're really happy with how the men's business is performing, Paul. I think that's reflected in a number of the stats that we quoted. We're seeing, on a regional basis, the men's and women's business are kind of accelerating proportionately in the same manner. We're not seeing regional differences by gender or within genders. What I would say is we saw a really strong performance in Q1 in the Southeast in particular. And that's probably related to weather, but that was a standout region across North America. Otherwise, there was -- there weren't noteworthy regional differences. We still have seen somewhat of a headwind in Alberta, in Canada versus B.C. and Ontario. But that's a continuation of a prior trend. In terms of the percentage of new guests, we did see -- the new guests that we have acquired in the first quarter, about 30% of them were men. So that was higher than the overall level of increase, a little bit higher than the number of women that we're attracting. So again, we're really pleased with our men's trajectory. And as I mentioned earlier, we feel like we're in probably a little ahead of schedule with men's in terms of our 2020 goals. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, how about penetration in Europe and Asia in the men's business? Stuart Haselden : It's -- we're a little higher in Asia and a little lower in Europe. And there's nothing that we would feel is alarming about that. I think it is -- I wouldn't necessarily draw any big conclusions from that strategically. That's how the business is trending now. But we still see both areas having deep opportunities for our men's business as we are able to gain success in driving awareness for it. Operator : The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I actually wanted to ask you a follow-up to your conversation about the CEO search. With everything clearly hitting on all cylinders, the management team working so well together, has the urgency level at the board level changed around the CEO search? Do you feel like you have more time and maybe even you're not necessarily wanting to disrupt the current equilibrium? Glenn Murphy : The short answer is no. And with that said, look, the performance of the business and the leadership of Celeste, Stuart and Sun, and this is a number of the understatements you've heard on the call today, is a great comfort to the Board of Directors. So we don't have to feel that we're -- I've seen other companies go through a full-fledged panic when situations like this arise. So I think that the fact that the business is performing even better than our expectations and that the leadership and the steady hands of the 3 people we've asked to step up to take on more responsibility has been incredible. I mean, I've witnessed it in Vancouver. So that certainly gives us comfort and allows us, as I said, I think, on the first call when this came up, I said that we're not in a hurry, but we have a sense of urgency. We do know that internally -- and mostly internally at the end of the day. I notice a lot of the people on the call who represent our external audiences. But if you think of our internal audience first, getting clarity about the new leadership going forward is super important. But it's nice to have -- to be in this place where I think we'd all rather have somebody in place when the time is right. But I think it's really nice to be able to be in this place. The business is performing, and we have great leadership at the top. Omar Saad : Got it. And then if I could ask just a quick follow-up. I think it was Paul's question around the new -- the huge number of new guests, 28%, I think, you said. Is that a big inflection from previous quarters? And if it is, what's the catalyst for the sudden kind of inflection of new customers kind of discovering the brand? Stuart Haselden : Omar, it's Stuart. So there's a couple of things we would point to. The first is the success we're finding with our digital marketing strategy. So we have -- we had just a more robust approach across a number of different elements of that digital strategy, which includes the e-mail, the success we're finding with e-mail. And I mentioned -- I described some of the factors that are giving rise to the acceleration in the e-mail capture, which is a part of the broader guest acquisition strategy. But I think it's a combination of success in digital marketing and the success broadly of the business. As we're attracting -- as we're presenting more compelling product assortments, we're attracting more guests to the brand, and we're being more efficient in how we're engaging with them once we have attracted them either to our stores or to our website. And that's a function of some of the improvements that we've made, both on the website, through the relaunch as well as what I described in terms of the POS improvements in capturing e-mail. So it's the combination of a few things. I do think it's just one thing in particular. And it just reflects the broad momentum that we're seeing across the business. Operator : Our last question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Just under the bell. So a follow-up to that question on the 28% increase. Is there any difference in the demographics you're seeing of the new customers? Is it skewing more male than female? Or any difference there? And then secondarily, on kind of the office travel collection that you've done so well within men's. It seems like there is more of that now occurring in the women's line. Can you talk about what the opportunity is there? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Sharon. And as I mentioned, the mix of gender, it's about 30% of the new guests are men or male. And so that's a little more than what is in the base business. So we're pleased to see a little higher percentage of guys being attracted to the brand. And otherwise, it's not a remarkable distinction versus our existing shareholder -- existing customer base or guest base, I should say, in terms of their demographic profile. And then to your other question regarding the office travel products that we've been exploring, the first thing I'd say there is we remain focused on solving problems for athletes. And we are a performance-oriented apparel business. So the opportunity that we have identified to leverage the technical functionality, fabrics and construction that we see in our performance products into more multi-use products, and there's a few good examples. The ABC pant in men's is probably one of the best. It's clear that our guests have an appetite for this. We're being pulled into these categories versus pushing our way into them, if you will. And it's not really new. This has been a part of our assortments, both in men's and women's, for quite some time. But we are identifying places where we can expand this. And again, it's where we're being pulled into. Our guests are asking for these types of products. And it's been, I think, an interesting or a good part of how we're evolving our product assortments. But suffice it to say, we remain focused on extending our position as a performance apparel business, and the multi-use products that we're exploring are a nice extension of those core technical capabilities that we have. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking to you in about 3 months when we report our second quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica inc. Please go ahead.

Joining me today to talk about our results are Glenn Murphy, Chairman of the Board; Calvin McDonald, our new CEO; Stuart Haselden, COO; PJ Guido, CFO; Celeste Burgoyne, EVP of America, is also with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but, which by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors Section of our website, www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the second quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Murphy : Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everybody. We had a very strong second quarter and because of that, I thought I'd just make a couple of brief remarks at the beginning, and then pass the call on to a number of speakers you're going to hear from today, including our new CEO, Calvin McDonald. Obviously, I want to acknowledge the performance. The second quarter of this fiscal year was very strong. And it was very strong across all facets of the business whether that's across different product categories, our channels of contact with our guests and across all our markets. That was just a very impressive second quarter result for lululemon. And because of that, I want to thank people who made the contribution and made this happen. And that's our management team, that's our educators, that's all other employees, whether distribution center, call centers, in our offices, who work together to produce these results. In particular, I do want to single out Celeste, Stuart and Sun, who stepped in and basically stepped up 6 months ago, and their leadership to the people I've identified earlier across our entire company. Their leadership, their focus really played an incredible role in the results that you're going to hear about later on. So I want to thank them on behalf of the Board of Directors.  And now I want to welcome Calvin McDonald. This is Calvin's first call with investors and analysts, first of many. He is really in an enviable position because the business is performing well, and he will agree and so will everybody else here from today, there's always more we can do. There's always more opportunities for our business. But because we're in a strong position today, Calvin can take his time. He can do a lot of listening. He can meet with people. He can understand our strategy and our processes and our operations and what makes the company tick. So that's a nice position to be in. And he has full confidence of the board. We did a very exhaustive search, and we really believe he clearly is the right CEO for the future for the company and will take us from strength to strength.  So with that said, I want to welcome to the second quarter analyst call and investor call, Calvin McDonald, the new CEO of lululemon. Calvin? Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Glenn, for the introduction and for the support you have provided me as I jumped into my new role. I'm very excited to speak with you from Vancouver as a member of the lululemon team. As this is only my second week on the job, I'll keep my comments brief. First and foremost, I'd like to congratulate the team on the tremendous results we've just posted for quarter 2 and the strong momentum we're now seeing into quarter 3. I'm very excited to now be part of helping to create the next chapter of growth at lululemon as we continue to build on this success. Stuart and PJ will take you through the details of our quarter 2 results and forward guidance. But first, let me offer some color on what attracted me to lululemon and my initial impressions after 10 days on the job. Being the CEO of lululemon is my dream job. I've chosen to focus my career on retail and brand building because I love to work with people, create product and innovate. I'm also an athlete. The opportunity to combine my professional passions with my personal ambitions is what makes this opportunity so exciting.  Firstly, the people of lululemon are an especially inspirational group, which has been very clear to me over the past 2 weeks. The unique culture with its focus on leadership, personal development and driving results is at the root of our success. It's both humbling and energizing to join such a talented group, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to help take us to the next level. Secondly, the product at lululemon is exceptional. I've been an avid guest for years and a fan of the product. I believe the quality, fabric, fit and technical innovation stand far above our competitors. It's very exciting to keep building on these unique attributes and help develop into new areas.  And finally, the innovation at lululemon is a core component of the DNA. The brand is iconic and our guests have given us permission to think about how we expand our offering to them in both product and services. When combined with the talent on this team, the future opportunities are very exciting. I look forward to how we continue to develop our guest ecosystem, connected via digital across all of our channels and geographies and extending our capabilities in loyalty where we have an opportunity to create something that is first unique and will further differentiate our brand. The combination of these elements, people, product and innovation are really my passion, and I'm thrilled to see where we can take them here at lululemon.  Before I pass it over to Stuart, I'll conclude by telling you how I plan to spend my initial time at the company. I feel it's important to meet as many people in the organization as possible. In my initial weeks and months, I'll spend time in every part of the organization : in stores, our store support centers, our distribution centers and our guest education centers. My approach is to listen and to learn as much as possible about the organization and our guests from the teams across the company and to become grounded in all things lululemon. This is an exciting time indeed to be joining lululemon. It's good to speak with you all today, and I look forward to getting to know you over the coming weeks and months. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Calvin. Let me also welcome you to lululemon. We're really excited to have you join the team and look forward to working with you on our next phase of growth. Our second quarter results mark another important step in the journey toward our 2020 goals as well as the continuation of the top line inflection that began last year and we now see extending into Q3, which is reflected in our sales outlook for the quarter.  In fact, we're now tracking to meet or even exceed a $4 billion revenue goal with men's and e-commerce effectively ahead of schedule. Our product assortments and supply chain work continue to exceed expectations, contributing to our gross margin that is now firmly reaching the mid-50s range. This result, combined with our solid SG&A management, has produced a trailing 12-month EBIT margin of nearly 21%, delivering on our goal of a low 20s operating profit. And it's important for our investors to understand that we still see opportunity for margin expansion as we further invest in these already successful initiatives, including expanding our e-commerce business, segmenting our supply chain, reducing lead times and expanding our distribution network. We believe our margins can continue to expand into the future. Turning to the headlines for Q2. We saw a broad-based acceleration in our business across an array of categories, channels and geographies. We had said on the Q1 call that our great results in that period were not simply a case of lapping weak prior year comparisons, and our Q2 results continued the story, reflecting the success of our ongoing structural investments. Combined comps for the quarter increased 19% on top of a 7% increase last year. This top line growth, along with significant improvements in gross margin and SG&A, delivered an 82% increase in EPS for the quarter. By channel, we saw store comps increase 10% and digital was up 47% versus a strong prior year comparison. This continued strength in our comps reflects the success we are seeing in our guest acquisition that increased 30% in the quarter and is fueling traffic increases across all channels. Specifically in stores, we saw a high single-digit lift in traffic while traffic to our e-commerce site grew over 20%. Improved product assortments and better brand and community building efforts, including several successful activations, also contributed to these strong traffic trends. We're also particularly pleased with the ongoing strength in e-commerce, which posted double-digit conversion and [ AOV ] increases in Q2 as our digital business continues to benefit from last year's site relaunch in Q3. Our guest is responding well to the improved experience, and we still see opportunities to remove friction and increase efficiency on the site as we continue to improve the search and checkout functions as well as expand further into personalization.  Our product assortments also performed well across practically every category in Q2, with double-digit increases across women's, men's and accessories. Women's pants, which is our highest margin category, along with men's pants, both posted comps over 30%. And women's tops generated another healthy double-digit increase as we gain traction in this category. It's also exciting to see accessories delivering its strongest quarterly comps in the last 5 years at over 20%. And Q2 saw several successful brand activations. An important moment for all of us here at lululemon was how we celebrated International Day of Yoga. Stores in more than 50 cities around the world hosted successful yoga classes on June 21 and we donated over $1 million through our Here to Be social impact program. We are incredibly proud of Here to Be, which benefits nonprofit groups that increase access to yoga and meditation for communities that face barriers to wellbeing. We continue to invest in this program to effect positive change in the communities around the globe where we work and live.  Turning now to our growth pillars. I'd like to offer some details on our strategic priorities, which continue to be extending our success in our digital channels, ramping our international expansion with a near-term focus on Asia, innovating our product assortments with a focus on accelerating growth in men's and continuing to roll out stores in North America that build on our important store format innovations. Our teams continue to deliver great results across these areas, which is setting the stage for our next chapters of growth. I'll share some highlights on our progress within each of these pillars now.  In digital, it's exciting to see our momentum continuing to build. Excluding the warehouse sale from last year's results, the constant dollar comp was 65% for Q2. And as I mentioned, traffic and conversion continue to be strong as both new and existing guests are responding well to enhanced online experience. Over the last 12 months, we've doubled the number of guests with whom we can communicate, and in Q2, we saw 80% growth in our e-mail file. We continue to see significant opportunities to enhance our digital guest experience. You've heard us talk about improvements we're making this year in checkout, search and personalization. Let me offer a couple of updates here. In checkout, in Q2, we saw a significant increase in the percentage of guests completing the checkout process, reflecting ongoing tactical improvements to the site. And in personalization, we now have our initial data scientist teams embedded within our brand teams who helped deliver insights used to inform and drive our successful Father's Day campaign. We are making steady progress here and expect to see ongoing improvements over the next several quarters. Turning to our international business. Our combined comps in Asia increased 50% this quarter as we continue to build momentum in the region. And importantly, in China, our e-commerce business continues to lead the way with a comp increase of over 200%. We lost our WeChat store in China in Q2 and remain on track to launch e-commerce sites in Korea and Japan later this year. In Europe, comps were again better than planned, an increase in the strong double digits. While we still have much work to do in this region, we're excited to see that our brand is resonating. We opened our first store in Sweden in a key destination city, in Stockholm. And in London this quarter, we hosted another successful Sweatlife Festival in which we partnered with 13 studios to offer over 250 classes and attracted over 4,500 guests.  Within product, we lead with innovation and continue to find success in our core classifications as we leverage our key franchises, including a line for women and ABC for men. Guests are also responding well to our newer office travel commute styles, including the on-the-fly collection, which offers versatile and \"away from the body\" silhouettes. Our men's business continues to accelerate, reaching a total penetration of 22% in the quarter with great new styles planned for the second half. And looking forward to fall, we're really excited for the expansion of our outerwear business. Despite the heat in August, we're already getting great initial reads on our early jacket and outerwear offerings.  And our North American stores continue to post impressive results with store traffic accelerating sequentially for the past 5 quarters and now extending into the early part of Q3. We opened 4 net new stores and completed 7 co-located remodels in Q2. We expect to open approximately 40 new locations in total by year end. In addition, we're seeing great success with our seasonal store strategy with 23 opened at the end of Q2 and plans to more than double that number into Q4. We also remain on track with our \"buy online, pick up in store\" initiative, which will begin to roll out later this year. Combined with the ship from store and our [ BBR or endless aisle ] store app, these omnichannel capabilities allow us to better serve our guests, while also leveraging inventory across both our store and e-commerce channels. I also want to highlight our integrated brand building efforts. We are now better able to combine the power of our community model with the improving power of our digital capabilities to better deliver our message to our new and existing guests. In Q2, building on last year's success, we sponsored 10k runs in Toronto and Edmonton. Across both races, we saw over 13,000 runners participate, including 4 Olympians, and garnered 9 million impressions on social media.  Looking forward to Q3, we will continue our global outreach via a collaboration with Francesca Hayward of The Royal Ballet in London, and we are thrilled about our plans to celebrate our 20th birthday, which started this month and continues through September. Without giving too much away, we plan a truly integrated celebration, which includes digital in-store events and a special capsule collection, a fitting way for us to recognize and celebrate our brand over the last 20 years while looking ahead to the next chapter.  Before PJ provides the details on our financial results, I wanted to offer a few final comments. While we are pleased with our current performance, we're laser focused on leveraging this momentum to enable a strong 2019 and beyond. Specifically, we are making a number of investments in the second half of the year, which PJ will speak to that will help us test strategies to potentially scale into next year. These tests consider multiple parts of our business, including experiential retail, digital guest engagement and conversion drivers across all channels. More to follow on this, but we are excited to build on our current success with these investments to help shape our future. And finally, I'd like to thank Glenn for support during our transition period, and I especially want to thank Celeste and Sun for their invaluable leadership in driving these incredible results. We're now excited to have Calvin on board and look forward to supporting his transition. And importantly, we'd all like to express much gratitude to our teams and our educators in particular around the world. It is only through their hard work that any of this is possible. I will now turn it over to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Stuart. Our brand-building efforts, guest engagement and innovative product offering continued to translate into very strong financial performance. Before I offer some highlights of that performance, I will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our investor site for additional details. For Q2, total net revenue rose 25% to $724 million, driven by great execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 10% comp store increase on top of the 2% increase in Q2 of last year. Lululemon-branded stores square footage increased 13% versus last year, driven by the addition of 42 net new lululemon stores since Q2 of 2017.  During the quarter, we opened 4 net new lululemon stores. In our digital channel, we saw strong traffic and higher conversion that resulted in a 47% comp increase. For the quarter, e-comm contributed $167 million of top line or 23% of total revenue. I will note that the impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by $2.8 million for the quarter. Gross profit for the second quarter was $396 million or 54.8% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 51.6% of net revenue in Q2 2017. The gross profit rate in Q2 increased 320 basis points versus adjusted gross margin last year.  This exceeded our expectations for the quarter and was driven primarily by the following : a 260-basis-point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product cost, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns versus last year. We are particularly pleased that this increase comes on top of a 260-basis-point improvement in product margin last year. In addition, we realized 70 basis points of leverage on occupancy and depreciation, a result of the strong top line results. We also saw a 20-basis-point favorable impact related to foreign exchange in the quarter. This was partially offset by a 30-basis-point increase in product and supply chain administrative expense. Moving down the P&L. SG&A expense was $262 million or 36.2% of net revenue compared to 38.8% of net revenue for the same period last year. We are pleased that we are able to deliver leverage significantly higher than our expectations.  More efficient spend in both our FSC and store channel, coupled with leverage from higher-than-planned sales generated approximately 280 basis points of leverage. This was partially offset by 20 basis points related to foreign exchange. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $134 million or 18.5% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 12.8% net revenue in Q2 2017. This represents a marked improvement in overall operating profitability of 570 basis points. Tax expense for the quarter was $40 million or 29.5% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.9% a year ago.  Normalized for charges related to last year's ivivva restructuring, the adjusted effective tax rate for Q2 2017 was 29.6%. Net income for the quarter was approximately $96 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.36 for the second quarter of 2017. Excluding charges related to the ivivva restructuring, adjusted EPS in Q2 2017 was $0.39. Capital expenditures were approximately $50 million for the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the second quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to IT investment in supply chain, data and analytics and further enhancements to our e-commerce platform in addition to new store builds and store renovations. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $778 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 24% in line with sales and was $393 million at the end of Q2. Pursuant to a $600 million share repurchase authorization put in place in June, we repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares at a total cost of $406 million during the quarter. This included our participation in a block trade executed by one of our largest shareholders, Advent International. As part of Advent's total sale of 10 million shares, we were able to repurchase 3.3 million shares at a total cost of approximately $400 million.  Due to the opportunistic timing of the trade, we used a combination of available cash and short-term borrowings to fund the repurchase. As a result, we ended the quarter with $100 million of debt under our revolving credit facility, which has since been fully repaid. We expect to end the year with a debt-free balance sheet and continue to evaluate further share repurchases through a broader capital allocation lens that balances working capital, investments and shareholder return considerations. We had $193 million of remaining authorization under the current share repurchase program at the end of Q2. Turning now to our outlook. Given our momentum and the recognition of what is currently working to drive our business, we are taking up our guidance for the year. And as a reminder, 2018 is a 53-week year for us. For Q3, we expect revenues to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low teens on a constant-dollar basis compared to the third quarter of 2017. This also assumes 10 new store openings in the quarter.  We anticipate gross margin to increase by approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 of last year. Although we are anniversarying strong increases in product margin, we are still very focused on further gross margin expansion through incremental reduction and average unit cost, driven by ongoing supply chain initiatives and scale efficiencies.  We expect to deleverage SG&A in Q3 by approximately 100 basis points. As you think about SG&A, please recall our comments from prior earnings calls regarding our expectation for SG&A pressure in Q3 related to strategic investments, including technology enhancements, data analytics, channel innovation and guest acquisition, the impact of which is heavier in Q3. Additionally, the strong momentum we're seeing in our business offers us an opportunity to further fuel growth in initiatives that are working for us as well as testing initiatives across guest and channel that have the potential to become additional revenue drivers going forward.  Assuming a tax rate of 30% and 133 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 versus adjusted EPS of $0.56 a year ago.  For the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.185 billion to $3.235 billion. This is also based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low teens on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open approximately 40 company operated lululemon stores in 2018. This includes 20 to 25 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low double digits. We now expect gross margin for the year to expand 100 to 150 basis points in 2018, primarily driven by the continued product margin improvement and leverage on occupancy and other fixed costs.  Despite the investments we are making in Q3 to fuel future growth, we are still expecting SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly as we continue to realize efficiencies within our cost structure while leveraging investments in technology, brand building and people.  We now expect our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.53. Our EPS guidance is based on 134 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2018. We continue to analyze the impact of U.S. tax reform and its overall implications for capital deployment. We have assumed the Canadian dollar at CAD 0.765 to the U.S. dollar for 2018 as well as Q3.  We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $240 million close to $250 million for the fiscal year 2018. The increase relative to 2017 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, increased store openings in international markets, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects.  In closing, I would like to call out our store, digital and product teams who are all working in unison to elevate lululemon globally. I, too, would like to thank Glenn for his leadership during this pivotal period and also welcome Calvin to the team. There's a great deal to be excited about around here. And it is not very hard to acknowledge that the best days for this company have yet to come.  And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : You've all delivered a really stunning level of acceleration in your comp performance, and it's not like 2017 or 2016 comps were terrible by any measure. But the acceleration is just so striking this year, and I'm wondering if you can sort of unpack it a little bit for us and help us understand what has really changed in the business that has driven this really accelerated level of growth. Anything that you could sort of -- any color you could add, I think, would be helpful. Stuart Haselden : Kimberly, it's Stuart. So let me speak to your question. So it really is a story around traffic in our stores. And with our e-commerce business, it's a story of traffic and conversion. And the underlying drivers of those traffic results are important to note. We mentioned on the call that we've seen 5 quarters of accelerating traffic trends in our stores, and that's not slowing down as we now enter the third quarter. And we've spoken about this to a degree on prior calls. We did launch or implement new guest engagement strategies, really last year. In particular, in the third quarter of last year, we implemented new technology at POS that enabled our store teams to more effectively engage with our guests and capture e-mail and capture information, making them a part of our guests file and enabling us then to enroll them in digital communications, digital marketing that we just didn't have before. At the same time, we have raised our game. We're more sophisticated with how we are in fact engaging in digital marketing. We're leveraging new CRM capabilities. We're taking the initial steps in data analytics to be able to leverage personalization strategies into how we're engaging with our guests. That is driving traffic both to our stores and to our website. And then on the e-commerce side, I'm sure you'll recall the recovery efforts that we went -- that we followed -- or we pursued, rather, last year, which culminated in the relaunch of our website at the end of the third quarter. The improvements to the website have been really the drivers of the improvements in conversion that we've seen. That story extends into 2018. And it will likely extend into 2019. So we focused on checkout, search, personalization on the website as the areas where we can continue to drive those converging gains. And as you look at the second quarter, if you exclude the online warehouse sale from last year, [ the comp ] in our e-commerce was really driven equally by traffic and conversion. So those are the strategies that we have developed and implemented in the recent period that has delivered this acceleration in our traffic trends. And so we're excited to see a number of ways to extend those to make them bigger, to amplify them, to take them forward and we feel like we're really just getting started. Operator : The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I wanted to talk a little bit about the supply side of the equation. So I think, Stuart, at our conference, you had talked about the new distribution center that I think is going to be in Toronto as well as the Haiti manufacturing facility from a third party. So can you kind of help us understand or frame how much faster to market you can be with some of these new resources? And particularly, as you get into Christmas where you're so high volume, if that will have any impact by that time frame? Stuart Haselden : Sure. There really are 2 separate issues, Sharon. And the first one, with regard to the DC, the new DC that we're opening up out in Toronto, will really help us improve the service commitments and the service experience of our guests in Eastern Canada. It will create additional strategic flexibility for us to evaluate more broadly across North America, how we leverage our distribution footprint. And that's something that we continue to explore. We can speak with more specificity in future calls. So we're excited about that, and that will yield a benefit in our gross margin and we'll likely be able to again speak with more specificity there into the future. As we look at the sourcing strategy and how we're leveraging nearshore capabilities, and you mentioned Haiti, and that's among a number of elements of that strategy that we are pursuing. We're very excited to be able to begin exploring and implementing a meaningful portion of our supplier base in geographies that will help us shrink and shorten our supply shipping times. So that's a result that we're just now beginning to see some of the benefits of. I would see that as a multi-year strategy that we haven't yet quantified exactly how much in terms of the time advantage it will create for us. But suffice it to say, we're very excited about it. At this point in the western hemisphere, meaning the Americas and Caribbean, we source about 9% of our total production. And so we're excited to see that grow into the future. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : I guess, Stuart, your trailing 12-month gross margin is now in the mid-50s, which will be the higher end of the initial 2020 plan. The 21% EBIT margin would be at the lower end of the low to mid-20s that you originally laid out. I guess help us to think about the operating margin opportunity as we think about the next 2 years? Maybe just split between what you see on the gross margin front versus SG&A leverage opportunity. Stuart Haselden : Sure, Matt. We're really thrilled with the results that we've been able to generate in gross margin. It has exceeded our expectations. And we do see it as the new margin architecture that we'll take forward. We see additional benefits, as we said on the call, in a number of areas within our sourcing strategies, our distribution strategies and then just leveraging the fixed cost elements of our gross margin from sales increases. So what I would say is there's modest improvements that we see being able to capture in both gross margin and SG&A over the next couple of years, which would accrue to modest improvements in the run rate of our EBIT margin. And I think we're excited about our strategies and the potential of the business beyond 2020, and that's something that we're looking forward to speaking with our investors in more detail at year end as we will be able to share an updated view of our long-term plans. But at this point, comfortable with modest improvements continuing for the next couple of years. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up on the e-commerce. So e-commerce accelerated pretty materially on a stacked basis. I guess as we think about that $4 billion 2020 plan and beyond, I guess, any change in the size or mix of e-commerce, what's the best way to think about the size and mix of e-commerce in that 20 billion, 24 billion maybe versus how it was originally laid? And just the other piece would be the profitability delta among channels. How best to think about that? Stuart Haselden : I think from an e-com standpoint, right now, we see continued acceleration or a continued outpacing of our store business with our e-commerce business, if you will. We continue to expect to see e-commerce grow faster than our store business. The composition of that is -- will be largely the same across both channels in terms of the mix of product categories. And we also expect to see benefits from the mix or the EBIT margin line as the e-commerce business continues to grow bigger. It is a more profitable business, and we'll have a mix benefit there. And again, I think we'll be able to reset our view on the long term at year end when we give that update on the long-term vision. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets. Brian Tunick : Curious, I guess, about the implied fourth quarter gross margins. I think only up, I don't know, 20 basis points. Is that a function of either tougher supply chain compares or a mix of business maybe away from the bottoms to more outwear? Maybe just talk a little about as we look ahead to what's implied in the fourth quarter gross margins? And then just curious on the international side. As you mix in more digital versus bricks-and-mortar, how are you thinking about the time it would take for the international business to be less dilutive? Is there a revenue target or sales or number of stores? Anything to help us think about when that could be more similar to the domestic profitability? Patrick Guido : Brian, it's PJ. So on your question about Q4 gross margin, yes, I think what we've been seeing is higher [indiscernible] given our women's pants business has really been on fire. We are not planning for it to be as robust as it has been if it does continue. We have the inventory to meet demand and we have the flex in the business but that's one thing. And then the other thing you mentioned, it is a tougher compare to last year, the gross margin and yes, we -- I think the combination of those 2 things hopefully that helps you kind of plug your model. I'll ask Stuart to answer the question about international. Stuart Haselden : Yes, Brian. We remain really excited about international, and we're seeing strong growth in Asia in particular. We expect as that business grows, it will improve or it is improving from a bottom line profitability standpoint. You'll recall that we had mentioned that Asia will be soundly profitable, generating strong profits this year so that in combination with the profits from Australia, the international business overall, inclusive of Europe, is profitable this year. And so that will only continue to accelerate as we capture scale economies in Asia. We're also very encouraged by the Europe business and the double-digit comps that we are seeing there, and maybe I'll invite Celeste to offer some comments. Celeste Burgoyne : Yes. In Asia to start with, we ended the quarter with a 50% combined comp. Really seeing strong momentum in both stores and digital, which is good to see and make us feel good about the momentum we also have going into Q3. In China, we launched our WeChat store, which we're really happy with the initial results and we have an aggressive plan for how digital will lead us into the future in China specifically. A really big highlight from a community perspective, we have Unroll China, which happens beginning this Saturday and going through the month of September. For Unroll China, we'll take yoga across China with stops in 13 key cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing and other key Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. So again, really excited about the momentum we saw in Q2, and really continuing to double down in both stores and digital to shift into the momentum that we know is possible for us in Asia in particular. And in Europe, again, it's strong Q2. A couple of highlights. I mean, that business really also supported through a very strong core London business, which has been our focus in the quarter. We had Sweatlife Festival happening, which brought together 4,000 people for a day of development sweat and community. So really happy with those results. And Regent Street, just for an example, actually finished the quarter with a comp of over 50%. So really excited about, yes, what we're seeing in terms of the momentum in those markets. And we have a lot of plans in terms of really doubling down and continuing that growth. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Mark Altschwager : I wanted to ask a question of Calvin, if possible. Sephora really has been a leader in personalization and merging the physical and digital shopping experience. So I was hoping you could speak to your view of Lulu's opportunity on those fronts and really what the vision -- your vision for what Lulu could look like in 2 to 3 years' time and whether you think an acceleration in digital investments is needed to get there? And along those lines, I think it was mentioned of some strategies that are being invested in right now to test I guess some things for next year, if you could maybe speak to the top couple that we could look forward to. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Mark. Well, why don't I start off. I'll hand the last part of the question over to Stuart, but I'll start off with sharing some of the similarities that I think exist between lululemon and the Sephora business. And the first one is the culture and values of both organizations. Lululemon is made up of an incredible strong talented group of individuals that are highly engaged, and that's across the entire organization. And retail is a people business. And when you have that level of engagement from stores to Store Support Centre, our ability to bring this brand to life and continue to build and develop it as a lovemark is very unique in retail and it's something that both organizations share. There's this notion or spirit of a disruptive innovator and I mentioned that, that's core to the DNA. And at lululemon, it is really throughout the entire organization. If you go back 20 years from how we came to be and that disruption and what was innovated to today, it lives throughout the organization and it's something that is within how we do things and it allows us to just approach problems differently and to think differently and it's a very strong similarity. Third, I'd say, both organizations put the guest at the center of all decisions of how we think about solving problems, how we think about growing and developing and innovating. And I think that's key to the success of a business today, that barriers and silos don't truly exist in the organizations. It's all about what's right for the guest regardless of the point of view or the areas of the business that, that leader may be leading, how they come forward is critical. And finally, and it builds to, I think, the point you are making, which is both have the ability to be exceptional and are exceptional experiential retailers. The product logically extends itself to creating something truly unique in this space where it's that connection between both heart and mind and how we activate that product through experiences only enhances what it is we sell, and we can do it through unique experiences that are truly differentiated and take full advantage of the relationship we have with our guests and the model that we have. So for me, there are a ton of similarities, and you alluded to some of the successes that we had over the 5 years that I worked at Sephora, and I believe many of those, the notion of creating this experiential ecosystem that connects across all of our channels and how we think of digital to do that exists at lululemon. And it has, more importantly, the core foundation to not only celebrate where we are today, but to think about how we continue to extend and build that forward. So I'm super excited about those core foundational strengths. There are a ton of similarities both in how the organizations are wired but how the guests interact with the brand and the [ permission ] that the brand has, and that's what I am really excited to learn, to listen and then work with this leadership team to author our next chapter of growth beyond the 2020 plan, which is equally exciting. And I'll let Stuart sort of comment on progress to that. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Calvin. And you guys heard PJ mention in the prepared remarks, we're making -- we explained a number of investments that we are executing in important areas of the business, data analytics, product, guest engagement that account for about half of the deleverage that we described. I'd say there's about another quarter of the deleverage that's related to more opportunistic tests that we have pursued in light of the strong business momentum that we have. And that's in areas that includes additional digital marketing investments, new elements of our seasonal store strategy, new store conversion [ thrusts ] and an interesting holiday delivery test. So all those are things that we're excited to have the opportunity to pursue. And the balance of the deleverage is really related to FX gains that we're now lapping. What I would say is if you exclude those elements, we would certainly be offering leverage on the low teens guidance that we offered. And so it's really an opportunistic place that we're in to be able to pursue the investments given the strength of our profitability gains. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Quick question, Calvin. The accomplishments that you've had in previous positions and I've studied and watched them, the things you've done with the loyalty program. How do you think of what you've had from previous positions to help Sephora -- to help lululemon whether it's the loyalty programs? What you see out there as some of the opportunities? And then, Stuart, as you talk about some of the new experiential influences that the business could have, how you see that in terms of the real estate landscape? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Dana. I've had a lot of conversations already with the leadership team and the teams across the organization. I would tell you, there is a ton of work that has been -- taken place and a lot of enthusiasm around many of the areas that you've identified as opportunities of strength and opportunities to do even more than we're doing today. And for me, what I've enjoyed and it's been 2 weeks, and I'm intending to take the opportunity over the next 100 days to continue to be curious and continue to work and ask the questions and to listen. But what I've really gotten excited about is the -- those similarities again between the businesses. And as I share my experiences, my general view is experiences at this point are to be shared and opinions are to be formed. And I'm really sharing the experiences and having incredible conversations with energetic talented teams that see a lot of the same similarities to continue to build that guest experience through the work happening around experiential, to think about how to further enhance the love that our guests have for our brands through loyalty. And loyalty is just the affection they have for the brand and there's a variety of ways in which we can do that. And digitally, how to continue the great work that the team has done, and how we look and think about augmenting and adding to the relationship we have with them and strengthen it even further. So what I would tell you is there's a lot of work that has been happening and people are working towards. And I'm excited about how a lot of the experiences in the work that I did at Sephora is very relevant here, and excited to work with this team over the coming period to continue those conversations form sort of the next plan of growth of which we'll share at a later point in time. Stuart Haselden : Dana, Stuart. I'm going to actually pass your question to Celeste on our experiential retail strategies. Celeste Burgoyne : Dana, so we've begun to see some exciting potential for expanding our offerings to our guests. We really started with focusing on Queen Street and Flatiron, and we're seeing exciting potential through these locations. It does show its opportunity for us to expand these ideas more broadly across our business in the future. And to Stuart's point, we have some tests happening in Q3 and Q4, which will definitely allow us to learn more about what's possible for us as we look into the future. And then outside of Queen Street and Flatiron, we're really pleased with what we are seeing in the co-located expansions from last year as well as the new ones we've opened this year. In Q2, we opened up 7 co-located stores, and they are averaging over 40% growth and close to 70% growth in men's in particular since open. This gives us confidence as we look to open an additional 18 this year and more into next as well. And it really allows us to engage with our guests in a bigger, more powerful and more engaging way. So again, kind of one example of how we are testing into experiential, and we're really focused on leveraging the different store formats that we have innovatively used in communities across North America. That, on top of the community work our stores do and the connection to the local ambassadors, really allows us to see a great future of going deeper into the experiential world. That again, excited to learn more and share more as we go through that journey. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Stuart, can you talk about the pipeline for store openings in 2019? What's already locked and loaded in terms of the mix between U.S. versus Europe versus Asia? And then, Calvin, I'm curious. I'm sure you come into the organization with some ideas of what's the next level looks like. I'm curious where you think lulu might actually be punching below its weight as you think about the next level? Stuart Haselden : Paul, it's Stuart. So store opening drive for 2019, what I'd say is you should think about our real estate expansion from a square footage growth standpoint. And the reason I say that is for the reasons that Celeste just highlighted with the importance of our co-located strategy this year and into next year. You're going to see low double-digit increases in square footage for us. You're going to continue to see a healthy number of new store openings in North America although those are diminishing versus prior years. You're going to see an increasing number of new store openings in Asia in particular and international broadly. So you'll see the balance of new store openings shift from North America to international. And you'll see a healthy mix of co-located projects and new store projects. So -- and with that, I'll turn it to Calvin for your second question. Calvin McDonald : Yes. I mean, I will -- I'll share just a couple of observations that I would've had as a guest. So my experience within Sephora and what that business had built as we doubled it over the time that I was there and scaled it, to my experience as a guest. And then I'll end with my first 10 days inside the organization because the views are very different. I think there is, including the results that support this. There is a lot of good that's happening in this business and the guests are responding in a very positive way, which is driving the results. We all would agree, and when I was looking outside in, that we have a real big opportunity internationally, in particular in Asia. And it's one that the team feels is a growth potential, a disproportionate growth for this business and brand. Experiential, how our stores are more experiential than they are today. The loyalty ecosystem, how the guest loves the brand today, but how can we build upon that in an even more innovative way. And community, which is something that quite frankly, lululemon created 20 years ago and it's such a powerful strength to the organization. And how do we do more? What I would tell you is my 2 weeks in joining in the conversations, these aren't insights I bring that were ahas to this organization. They were well aware of their strengths and the opportunities. And this leadership team has been working towards developing and innovating behind these pillars. What I'm excited about is how my experiences in the 5 years at Sephora and the journey that we went through as we doubled the business, as we invested and doubled down and led in some of these areas that I can work with them and the great work that they've already started and begun to author that next chapter. So I think everybody on the management team is super excited about the results and the plans and where the brand in the business can continue to innovate and go. Equally, I am and these are areas that my experience at Sephora will allow sort of thought partnership with this team as we continue to create moving forward. And that I'm super excited about. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock : I want to talk about women's pants because a 30% comp is truly outstanding, and that's on top of several years of really strong results in that business. And you're prudently not expecting that growth or that strength to continue, but you probably didn't expect the strength that you've seen over the last 3 years, so I was wondering how your thoughts on the TAM of your women's business has evolved from this kind of strength. And two, how you think about share of closet with this kind of strength occurring? Stuart Haselden : Matt, it's Stuart. So you're right, the performance in women's pants has exceeded our expectations. And it's pretty remarkable that the fabric, the new Lulu fabric for our #1 style, the lined pants that we just introduced 3 years ago, has eclipsed Luon and the wunder under that the company was really built on in many ways. So what it speaks to and what -- the insight that we take from that, the profound insight we take from that, is that innovation matters. And that where we innovate in fabric, in function, in technical performance, it opens avenues for growth that in many ways, are boundless. So we don't really know how big that market is. And it would be somewhat shortsighted for us to try put a limit on it at this point given we've been wrong with our plans certainly this year. And the overall success of that fabric and that pant. And you know what? We think we can make it better and we're already in that work and there are new versions of that fabric that we will be introducing next year into the sequential years. So that's one of the things that gets us excited about not only our women's business, but our business overall. So I'm not sure that exactly answers your question. But -- and I would say broadly speaking, you heard us mention the \"on the fly\" franchise that we're introducing, which is helping us take that technical functionality into our \"office, travel, commute\" offerings. And so much the same way that the ABC pant for our guys has given them a great versatile multiuse product that they can take on the plane, they can take from the gym and from the studio. We believe that on the fly will offer the same thing for our female guests. And so super excited with the innovation, and I would be remiss if I didn't also offer one additional comment to Kimberly's original question around what's been driving the overall growth trajectory of the business. Our product assortment has gotten remarkably better. So Sun and the work that the design team and the merchant teams have been leading is absolutely a part of the equation in addition to the other things that I mentioned. So we're thrilled at the improvements in color, in texture, in print that Sun and the team have been delivering. There's so many exciting new product introductions we're going to see in the second half of the year. Outerwear begins to land in stores and online now. We're really thrilled with how that's checking. And there's a number of others that we're really excited for. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. I'll now turn the call back over to Howard Tubin for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you in about 3 months when we report our third quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.",

Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; Stuart Haselden, COO; PJ Guido, CFO; Sun Choe, our Chief Product Officer, is also with us and will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.  Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our Investors site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to our quarter 3 earnings call. I'm excited to kick off this quarter's call, especially since it represents my first quarter as CEO of lululemon. And I have to tell you that with everyday in this position, I'm more enthusiastic than ever about the brand, our people and the opportunities ahead.  Over the past 3 months, it's been fantastic to see lululemon from all angles, from the educators in our stores to new guests in China, to the creative team imagining our next product categories and to the many teams at our Store Support Centres across our markets. The strong momentum in our business continued during the quarter, and we see many opportunities to build upon this success in the near and long term. On today's call, I'll first share with you some insights and highlights before handing it off to Stuart for a more in-depth discussion on our quarter 3 results. PJ will finish up our prepared remarks with a detailed quarter 3 financial review and our guidance outlook. Then we'll be happy to take your questions.  Looking at our quarter 3 results, all of us on the senior leadership team first want to thank our teams around the world for their hard work, enthusiasm and commitment to delighting our guests every day. All of these efforts have contributed to our robust performance this quarter. What's so exciting to me about our business is the broad-based strength we're continuing to see across our channels, categories and geographies, fueled by our innovative products and our unique community-based brand-building initiatives.  Before speaking to some of our key product initiatives, I'd like to share with you my distinct pleasure in recognizing a proven leader at lululemon. Sun Choe, with her well-deserved promotion to our Chief Product Officer, which I announced earlier this quarter, has been heading up the entire product organization since February. Her leadership and creativity are evident in the examples you're going to hear about this afternoon. It's important to all of us that lululemon remain a product-led organization, and Sun's experience and strengths will allow us to live into this vision. We have the brand permission to move into so many new categories, determining which ones and at what pace is the exciting work we're currently in. Sun and her team are working on these future innovations to help ensure our pipeline remains robust, and I'm excited to be part of this work and thrilled with what we will continue to be bringing to market.  As an example of this dynamic innovation, this fall, you saw the early results of our strategic decision to focus on outerwear in a bigger way, and guest response to the assortment has been fantastic. Bras are another important opportunity. The launch of Like Nothing, our first bra design to be worn all day, has performed very well in the quarter. And our collaboration with Francesca Hayward and the Royal Opera House in London is another example of how we successfully leverage our relationships with cultural influencers relevant to our collective. Sun is with us on the call today and will be available for any questions you may have around our product.  Switching gears, I'd like to highlight 2 important strategies that we moved forward in North America this quarter, both which leverage our strengths in brick-and-mortar. They are buy online, pick up in-store and our seasonal store rollout. The [ build-this ] pilot is now live in 35 stores across 4 markets. It's proceeding well and helps us leverage our capabilities across channels. Our seasonal store strategy is now in full swing for the holiday season, with 43 open at the end of quarter 3 and 6 more planned for quarter 4. Not only do these stores increase convenience for our existing guests during this hectic time of year, but they also attract a significant number of new guests to our brand. Based on last year's performance, we expect to see approximately 40% of guests in these stores new to lululemon.  While growth outside of North America holds great potential for us, the opportunity within the U.S. and Canada remains our largest and most important in the near term. Our agile store formats, including colocated, local standard, seasonal and experiential, combined with our exciting omni-experience initiatives, will allow us to keep expanding our square footage while creating a very flexible and unique store network.  This potential was clear during my market visits this quarter, spending time with our store teams in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, L.A. and, of course, Vancouver. In all of these visits, we shared ideas that we will be bringing to life in the future, including new and innovative ways to connect with our local communities, experiential retail and ways to better leverage our online and off-line ecosystems. The creativity within our store teams was both contagious and inspiring. I've also been spending a great deal of time with the talented people in our brand and community teams and sharing with them some of the insights I've gained over the years. In quarter 3, we continue to engage with our guests as only lululemon can through our SeaWheeze Half Marathon in Sunset Festival in Vancouver and our Ghost Race virtual runs across 12 cities in the U.S. and Canada. During SeaWheeze, over 10,000 runners descended on Vancouver to take part in the race and attend the festival, which included yoga and, of course, an entertaining dance party. With this year's Ghost Race, we partnered with Strava again and remained the #1 run community on their app. We had 35,000 guests registered for the race, of which nearly half were men and 20% were new to lululemon.  Outside of North America, our activations were equally robust, included our third annual Unroll China event across 8 cities and our first-ever Sweatlife Festival in Berlin. I'm also proud of how we brought our 20th birthday to life. During this event, which was truly a global activation, we updated our iconic manifesto, launched a capsule product collection and held celebrations in key markets around the globe. The passion our guests and educators have for our brand is clear, but we believe that, over time, we can make our brand expression even stronger and more consistent across channels and touch points. Our brand has so many exciting messages to communicate, determining how, where, when and to whom we tell is the exciting work we are in now. Becoming better storytellers is a key focus for us, driving our brand awareness and acquiring even more guests into our brand.  Building on our ability to acquire new guests, I'd like to share with you some details of an exciting test we began during the quarter, our first-ever loyalty program. lululemon has always had a strong connection with our guests, thanks to the great work of our educators, community teams and ambassadors. However, it's clear that we can take these relationships to the next level with a loyalty program. I'm excited to be working with the teams to create an offering that is unique, disruptive and perfect for lululemon.  Our current test is taking place in Edmonton. For an annual fee, members receive several benefits, including either a pants or pair of shorts designed exclusively for the program, access to sweat classes, attendance at curated events, personal development and free expedited shipping on e-commerce orders. Initial reads are strong as our Edmonton guests love the program. We'll have more to share with you subsequently as we continue to pilot and roll out to more markets next year.  And finally, one of our largest opportunities is expansion outside of North America. As you know, this is one of our strategic growth pillars, and we continue to execute on our plans to build out key markets within the Asia and Europe. It was exciting to visit China and see the enthusiasm for lululemon firsthand. This is such a dynamic market with fast and emerging trends. What's happening in China is truly special.  There are over 400 million millennials who are digitally engaged, beginning to invest in health and fitness and looking for brands that bring both great product solutions and experiences. On my trip, I visited all of our stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, and spent time with our local educators, store managers and Store Support Centre teams. I'm thrilled to be working with them to refine and elevate our long-term growth plan. The opportunities are considerable, beginning with our digital and retail experiences our brand and community expressions and, of course, our product. We will aim to strike the right balance between leveraging our global strength while acting locally where it matters most to keep winning. I'm so excited with what we're seeing thus far in China and in Asia overall, and I'm personally committed to making our success in this region a priority.  In Europe, where I am visiting next week, we held our first Sweatlife Festival in Berlin, where we connected our guests with local studios and teachers to celebrate the expanding fitness landscape. And in Paris, building on the strength of our showrooms, we opened a shop-in-shop in Le Bon March\u00e9, the iconic Parisian department store. Our business in Europe continues to perform well. We're happy with our progress and remain very positive about our future opportunities in the region. I look forward to working with the local leadership team to continue our plans to win in Europe, which will include balancing our approach to focus on cities versus countries and continuing to drive our brand awareness.  Before handing it over to Stuart, I'd like to conclude my prepared remarks by saying it is a distinct honor to work with such an extremely talented group of leaders, employees and educators. It is their passion and dedication and enthusiasm that fuels our strong performance and brings our brand to life each and every day. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Calvin. Let me also add my congratulations to our teams around the world for the exceptional results that continue to keep us on course to achieve and even exceed our goal of $4 billion in revenue by 2020. In the third quarter, our teams delivered another outstanding performance, posting strong increases across guest engagement, traffic and conversion. And importantly, we also posted product margin expansion well above expectations, which has enabled us to accelerate opportunistic SG&A investments in the quarter aimed at supporting our growth into next year and beyond.  I believe we will look back on 2018 as a milestone year for lululemon, where the culmination of our multiyear investments in supply chain, technology and innovation, broadly, have delivered an inflection in our business that has set us on a new trajectory. We are committed to building a durable growth story and believe we are just getting started. This is what we want our investors to hear today. In the coming months, we look forward to sharing details of how this story will take shape beyond 2020, but today, we're excited to relay details of Q3. Specifically, in the third quarter, we saw continued strength, with total revenue up 21%, combined comps of 18% on top of a 7% increase last year and a 34% increase in EPS. These strong comp trends continue to be driven by traffic and conversion increases across both stores and e-commerce. The strength of our merchandise assortments and guest engagement efforts across multiple touch points are helping fuel these increases. I'd also note that our improving capabilities in personalization within digital marketing are allowing us to speak to our guests in more informed and efficient ways and enabling further increases in traffic and conversion. Guest acquisition increased 41% in Q3, while our e-mail list grew 90%. These efforts collectively contributed to a store traffic increase in the quarter in the high single digits and an increase in traffic to our e-commerce site of over 35%. And it's exciting to see the momentum from Q3 extending now into Q4, evidenced by our exceptionally strong results over the Thanksgiving weekend.  Thanksgiving was the biggest day ever in our e-com business, only to be surpassed by the results we saw the next day on Black Friday. What's interesting to note is that both days, individually, were larger volume days than Cyber Monday, as our guests shopped earlier and wanted to get a jump-start on the holiday season.  And over this weekend, we saw a strong response to our Align, Wunder Under and Speed Up pants, while on the men's side, joggers were a favorite, including the ABC, Surge and Intent styles.  Turning now to the highlights within our other growth pillars. Product innovation continued to be a key part of the growth story in Q3. We posted strong comps in the quarter that increased in the double digits in all major categories. Newness and technical innovation within our assortments are resonating with our guests, while we're also seeing success as we leverage our core franchises. As Calvin mentioned, outerwear was particularly strong for us on both the men's and women's side, with comps increasing over 150% and 40%, respectively. We've expanded the assortment relative to last year by offering more puffer and water-resistant styles, including the Cloudscape Jacket for women and the Outpour Parka for men. We're still in the early stages with outerwear, and we're excited of the potential we see here.  And men's continues to be an exciting growth story for us, posting some of our highest overall category increases. As we've mentioned previously, we are effectively ahead of schedule to reach our $1 billion sales goal for men's in 2020. In Q3, we launched an exclusive capsule with MR PORTER, a leading online men's style destination. Our collection consists of 18 styles and is available in select lululemon stores internationally and online globally at mrporter.com. So far, guest response has been strong, and we're excited to test new partnerships such as this to continue to drive awareness for our men's business.  Shifting gears to digital. We continue to benefit from the digital acceleration work we completed last year. In Q3, digital represented just over 1/4 of our business, putting us ahead of schedule to reach our goal of 25% full year penetration in 2020. As I mentioned, traffic to our site grew over 35% in Q3, while conversion increased in the high single digits. Our expanded capabilities in digital marketing and data analytics are enabling these important traffic and conversion increases that we've been seeing all year. We've made important steps to strengthen our capabilities within digital marketing. This includes using data science to inform our marketing efforts, which is driving higher levels of guest engagement reflected in our new guest acquisition levels. And we continue to hear positive feedback from guests visiting our website regarding ongoing improvements within checkout, segmentation, search and browse. Examples include improved speed and processing during checkout, personalized versions of the website and automating the browse experience based on merchandise performance data. These enhancements and others are driving higher conversion rates, and we expect to see gains in these areas continue into 2019.  And finally, building on Calvin's commentary regarding our international business, I'd offer some additional highlights. In Q3, the strength continued with total market growth in Asia and Europe increasing more than 50% in each region. In China, we continue to see strength within our digital business. Our e-commerce business grew 76%, with a 2-year increase of over 200%. I'd also highlight Singles' Day last month, when we saw an increase of over 150% in our Tmall business. Outside of China, we launched our local market e-commerce site in Korea. And at the end of October, we opened our very first store in Osaka, Japan. All good signs of what the future holds for us across Asia.  Before handing it over to PJ, there are a couple of additional things I'd like to highlight. For the full year 2018, we are on track to deliver an annualized increase in product margin of over 700 basis points since 2015. Our strategic supply chain programs, amplified by favorable product mix and strong full price selling, have driven these increases. And investors should note that we are making important new investments across our distribution network that should enable us to capture additional gains and product margin over the next couple of years. We are well ahead of our goals that we had previously set for 2020 in both gross margin and operating profit margin. Importantly, this has enabled us to accelerate a number of key infrastructure investments to sustain our top line growth as we did in this quarter. I'm so proud of the teams who have delivered these results and who continue to identify new strategies to extend these gains.  And with that, I'll now turn it over to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Stuart. Q3 marked another quarter of strong financial performance, and we are on track to finish what is shaping up to be one of our best years on record. Before I offer some highlights on Q3 and provide guidance for Q4 and full year 2018, we will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our Investors site for additional details.  For Q3, total revenue rose 21% to $748 million, driven by solid execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 7% constant dollar comp store sales increase on top of a 1% increase in Q3 of last year. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 38 net new lululemon stores since Q3 of 2017. During the quarter, we opened 11 net new stores and completed 9 colocated remodels. In our digital channel, we saw strong traffic and higher conversion that resulted in a 46% comp increase. For the quarter, e-com contributed $189 million of top line, reaching 25% of total revenue. And I would add that the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $9.3 million in the quarter. Gross profit for the third quarter was $407 million or 54.4% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 52.2% of net revenue in Q3 2017. The gross profit rate in Q3 increased 220 basis points versus adjusted gross margin last year. This exceeded our expectations for the quarter and was driven primarily by the following : a 280 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns. We are particularly pleased that this increase comes on top of a 70 basis point improvement in product margin last year. Overall gross margin expansion was partially offset by 30 basis points of reinvestment in product innovation and distribution center upgrades and 30 basis points from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were $271 million or 36.2% of net revenue compared to 34.8% of net revenue for the same period last year. As we mentioned on prior calls, we have used our strong performance year-to-date to fuel further investments in long-term growth. These investments contributed to the 140 basis points of deleverage experienced in the quarter and included technology enhancements, advancements in data and analytics, funding for new test initiatives such as loyalty and Selfcare and a ramp-up of seasonal store openings. In addition, foreign exchange revaluation and translation contributed 30 basis points of deleverage. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $136 million or 18.2% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 17.4% of net revenue in Q3 2017.  Tax expense for the quarter was $43.5 million or 31.6% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 32% a year ago. As a result of finalizing our prior year federal tax returns and interpreting ongoing guidance, we incurred an incremental tax expense of $5.2 million related to the onetime transition tax that was enacted as part of U.S. tax reform. Excluding this charge, the adjusted effective tax rate for Q3 2018 was 27.8% compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 30.8% in Q3 2017. During the quarter, we reduced our estimated effective tax rate for the year and, subsequently, the quarter after adjusting for additional tax credits for research and development, favorable mix of profit by jurisdiction and other adjustments associated with filing our U.S. tax returns.  Net income for the quarter was approximately $94 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to earnings per share of $0.43 for the third quarter of 2017. Excluding charges related to U.S. tax reform in Q3 2018 and the ivivva restructuring in Q3 2017, adjusted EPS in Q3 2018 was $0.75 versus adjusted EPS of $0.56 in Q3 2017. Capital expenditures were approximately $73 million for the quarter compared to approximately $57 million in the third quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to IT investment and supply chain, data and analytics and store capital for both new locations and renovations.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $704 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 25%, relatively in line with sales, and was $496 million at the end of Q3. We repurchased 64,729 shares during the quarter at an average price of $124.95, and we had approximately $185 million remaining under the current authorized share repurchase program at the end of Q3.  Turning now to our outlook. Given the ongoing strength of our business, we are taking up our guidance for the year. And as a reminder, 2018 is a 53-week year for us. For Q4, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.125 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the high single to low double digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This also assumes 14 new store openings in the quarter. We expect gross margin to increase by approximately 50 to 100 basis points versus Q4 of last year. Although we are anniversarying strong increases in product margin, we are still focused on further gross margin expansion through incremental reduction in average unit cost, driven by ongoing supply chain initiatives and scale efficiencies.  We expect SG&A rate in Q4 to be flat to up 50 basis points as select opportunistic investments continue in the quarter. Assuming a tax rate of 30% and approximately 133 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.67 versus adjusted EPS of $1.33 a year ago.  For the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.235 billion to $3.245 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis. We expect to open approximately 36 company-operated stores in 2018. This includes 20 to 25 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low double digits. We now expect gross margin for the year to expand 150 to 200 basis points in 2018, primarily driven by continued product margin improvement and leverage on occupancy and other fixed costs. Consistent with our 2020 plan, we are still expecting SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly.  We now expect our fiscal year 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.68. Our EPS guidance is based on 134 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 29.5% in 2018. We are continuing to analyze the impact of U.S. tax reform and its overall implications for capital deployment globally.  We assume the Canadian dollar at $0.765 to the U.S. dollar for 2018 as well as Q4. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $235 million to $245 million for fiscal year 2018. The reduction relative to our prior guidance predominantly reflects select new store opening being shifted into next year. The increase versus 2017 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, new store openings, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects.  In closing, while we still have the bulk of the quarter ahead of us, we're happy with our start to the holiday season and are looking forward to finishing the year strong and carrying our momentum into next year.  And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Congratulations on a wonderful quarter. My question is on inventory. I was wondering if you could talk about the end-of-quarter inventory and then plans for the end of the year. Are you seeing any port congestion? Or have you brought in any inventory early in advance of potential tariff impact? Patrick Guido : Adrienne, this is PJ. We are really happy with our inventory levels at the end of Q3 and going into Q4 into the holiday season. The inventory is in great shape by quality and makeup. We did not change our inventory cadence because of any tariff issues or anything to that effect. So generally, we are in -- if you like, we're in great shape from an inventory perspective. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And then just as a follow-up, are you seeing any freight increases for 2019? Patrick Guido : We are not seeing any freight pressure so far. No. Operator : Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISA -- ISI. Omar Saad : Calvin and Stuart, if you could, it sounds like you're going to get to, I don't know, 1/4 of your business through e-commerce this year, which I think is your 2020 goal 2 years early. It's been a really huge source of upside, especially when you think where you were a year or so ago. What can you point to are the key drivers of that upside, getting such a higher penetration of your e-commerce business much earlier than you had anticipated? And how long can this kind of accelerated pace of growth with that digital side of your business continue? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Thanks, Omar. Great question. We're seeing really strong traffic and conversion in our e-commerce business. These are trends that we had called out earlier in the year. On the traffic side, it's -- we really see this as a function of the enhanced digital marketing strategy that we've been able to put into the market. And specifically, part of that has been new data analytics capabilities. We've been able to automate much of our e-mail marketing strategies as well as bring personalization into sharpening how we're able to send those e-mails and digital engagement with our guests in a more specific and informed manner versus our guests. So that's been a big part of the traffic story. On the conversion side, it continues to be the improvements that we've made to the website, and we continue to define opportunities to enhance the experience for our guests online. So we've been pleased with that performance as well. And finally, I'd say the -- there are no structural constraints for us to drive the penetration of our e-commerce business well above 25%. And I would also point to the fact that we enjoy a much higher contribution margin for our digital business that is certainly accretive to our company overall operating profit margin. So we are very bullish on the outlook for our e-com business. We have a great team and a number of enhancements that are in the works for next year. So very excited at the future we see in that part of the business. Omar Saad : That's helpful. And one clarification. Did you guys say you're doing a test loyalty and charging the loyalty members and it's working really well? Is that what I heard? Calvin McDonald : Yes. We did a membership test in Edmonton, and the fee was $128, which we wanted to test. And for that, guests were able to choose between either a pant or a pair of shorts. In addition to that, they had access to monthly curated sweat classes that we worked with the local community and our ambassadors to highlight and showcase. They have some shipment benefits on e-commerce, and we'll be able to gain early access into our Sweatlife Festivals and other events that we're planning to continue to bring. So -- and the response was very strong, exceeded our expectations. And we're going to continue through the first half of next year testing and piloting that. We have a few additional markets that we are going to be launching it in and very excited as we look forward to the ability to have a membership-based program where it's driving loyalty, but guests are seeing value in this curation of services and content beyond just our product and in buying into the program and driving value through the loyalty. So early days but very excited about the work and what we have planned for the program moving forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : One follow-up there on the loyalty program. If you test the program in different markets, will it be the same structure with the membership fee and the same types of benefits? Or will you be testing different types of loyalty program there? Calvin McDonald : Great question. We are in test phase. What I would tell you is we were very excited with the way in which the guests responded to the initial launch and pilot. The intent moving forward is to have a fee attached. We are going to test and play with the $128. In fact, we think there's opportunity to price above that based on the engagement and response we saw from the guests. So we actually feel we can increase the price to the value of the program and the additional services they offer. So most of first half of 2019 is going to be tinkering, playing with the program, getting the curation of services right. But we are super excited and we'll continue to lean in and test and learn around the notion of a membership paid for and the curation of services that we offer. Alexandra Walvis : Great. That's really interesting. And then a second question from me. You called out in your prepared remarks success in the everyday bra category, which is a new place; and outerwear, you're expanding to a broader range of wear-to-work categories. I'm just thinking, I'm just wondering how this has changed how you're thinking about your addressable market and your super long-term sales opportunity and whether success in these fringe categories is giving you confidence of the ability to play in more areas. Sun Choe : Alex, this is Sun. To your question, we really don't know how high is high. I mean, right now, we see both bras and outerwear as big category expansions for us. They definitely represent a significant amount of opportunity. And given our position of the intersection of feel, fashion and function, we feel like there is whitespace beyond the categories that we're known for today. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter, guys. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Matt. Matthew Boss : So on gross margin, maybe could you just help break down the product margin opportunity in the fourth quarter? And just how would you rank the gross margin drivers as we exit this year and then going forward? Patrick Guido : Yes, Matt, this is PJ. So, yes, we've seen a big benefit in gross margin throughout the year and in Q3, and it's come from mix, lower markdown and higher comp above what we planned. We expect all these metrics to remain strong, but we've planned into a more -- a little bit more of a moderate benefit. But should we see higher demand materialize, we have the flex in the business to meet it. We do see continued opportunity on the sourcing and supply chain side, which has been a great story and will continue to be. And although we may not see step function gains as we have in the past, there's still meaningful gains to be had there. Stuart Haselden : Yes. And, Matt, it's Stuart. I'll add to that. There still is opportunity for us to further expand our supply chain segmentation strategy that we've talked about to drive more of our assortment into the lower cost part of the supply chain. And also, as I alluded to my prepared remarks, there is -- there are new investments we're making in our distribution networks that will provide benefits to our product margins into next year and beyond. So those are things that we feel are structural, programmatic that we will be able to bring to bear and benefit our product margins as we go forward. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up along those lines. On the expense front, I guess, on some of these investments that you're talking about that took place in the third quarter, should we think about these continuing into the fourth? And as we think beyond this year, is there any change to SG&A leverage at low to mid-teens revenue growth that I think you've identified in the past? Patrick Guido : Yes. So we do expect the investment to continue into Q4. What I'll say about SG&A is -- so the majority of the deleverage in Q3 came from both planned and incremental investment in long-term growth, right? So we invested in IT to enhance our data and analytics and digital marketing capability. We invested in the guest experience and guest engagement by testing the loyalty program. We invested in testing new product categories, Selfcare. We also invested in more seasonal stores, which -- to gauge new markets, reach new guests and build brand awareness. So I would say these will continue into Q4. And we do -- we have guided to modest deleverage, but for the full year, we still expect to leverage SG&A. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Great result, love to see the acceleration here. I guess, my first major question is just new customer acquisition, you have a lot of initiatives here that seem to be working out pretty well. And what actually is working the most? Like where are you finding the best results in terms of getting new guests to shop lululemon? Is that just the seasonal stores? Is it the product itself is why new guests are shopping? What's really driving this today? Stuart Haselden : Yes, Matt, it's Stuart. So there's a number of things that we see as providing a big tailwind for us in terms of guest acquisition. First thing, we should start with is the product assortment. So that lifts the overall business, as you would imagine, and drives both traffic and conversion. The other areas we've talked about, we've mentioned briefly, even today and, certainly, on the prior calls, we're seeing the digital marketing strategies providing a much more successful level of engagement with our guests that is, in turn, helping drive traffic into our stores, where we were able to convert that traffic and engage more successfully with new technology we deployed at the end of last year [ at express ]. So I would point to those things, multichannel strategies store and online, leveraging new capabilities within data analytics, they're helping us drive those increases. And we continue to see opportunities to drive those levels even higher. Matthew McClintock : And then if I could ask Calvin a question. Related to your trip to Asia, clearly, that's been a strong part of the company now for a little while. Was there anything that actually caught you off by surprise in the sense of the opportunity there or challenges, something that you just didn't expect when you went there? And then what are you looking for when you go to Europe next week? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. In terms of in China, I would tell you that everything was very positive. If I just look at the cities that I visited and the market and the evolution of how customers are embracing the notion of the sweat life through the growth that was happening in studios in and around these cities, all the basis of what drove our business in North America is happening and accelerating. So culturally, you really -- I really sensed and witnessed this energy behind the ingredients that we know helped to drive our brand and where the brand -- our brand does so well. And then how we were fitting into that, there was nothing but opportunity. So building upon the great work that the team there has done, what was so exciting in the visit was not just seeing this energy that's happening, where we don't need to create it, we just need to be part of it. But then look at how we are showing up in the opportunities around our brand and community initiatives, how we express and communicate who lululemon is and the opportunity behind living the sweat life, the role that events can play, our ambassador program and thinking about it differently in this dynamic market that's growing. And then, obviously, product, we've done some local product with our Asian fit, and it's responded so well. It's the discussions of how do we continue to do more of that, recognizing the uniqueness and opportunity that we have in this market. So I would tell you, I walked away incredibly energized and excited about our potential. And I think our results are indicating the opportunity, but there's even more we can continue to do and will do. And I'm excited to be in that work with the team to drive that. And I think, for me, in Europe, working with Gareth and the team, it is really going to be understanding similar dynamics. Where do we see sweat evolving within Europe? What are the opportunities of where we're playing to keep building the brand, getting the awareness, accumulating, acquiring guests and making sure that our growth is both in -- concentrated in cities where we see opportunities and getting that balance between going deeper in cities or broader into countries and having that dialogue and discussion with them? Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Brian Tunick : I'll add my congrats to the team. Maybe one for Sun, first. Maybe you can talk about how you think your calendar of newness looking into 2019. Obviously, a lot of great work on the supply chain. But just curious, you'll obviously have to lap some very strong product and new fabric launches. And just curious about how your calendar and then pipeline looks heading into 2019. Sun Choe : Great. I actually am really excited about what our pipeline looks for 2019. Our -- what we have in terms of innovation is very rich. And I would say, as I mentioned earlier, bras and outerwear as a category represents a big opportunity for us. In terms of innovation, we have some great things lined up, and one that I like to highlight is specifically some innovations that we are introducing in run across men's and women's. So in men's, we have some things that really solve for high humidity, high heat solutions. We also are introducing cooling yarn for the guests across men's and women's. And then in terms of high support bras, we launched the Enlite a couple of years ago. We are going to be extending upon that franchise. So we introduced the front zip this year. Next year, we have a hydration vest based off of the Enlite as well as just other evolutions of Enlite. And we do know that part of the huge success of 2018 has been through franchise extensions. They do work for us. And so that's a lot of what's in store for next year. Brian Tunick : And then if I could just ask anyone to comment about the Selfcare launch. Any learnings so far? And maybe what kind of guard rails do you guys think the company has to sell more things to let the guests live their best life? Calvin McDonald : I'll take the question on Selfcare. So as you know, we tested it in the quarter in a handful of markets, be it Chicago, Orange County and Toronto. And the lineup currently consists of 5 products in a variety of sets and a variety of sizes. And I think it is a -- it's a great example of the work the team has been doing and is doing to identify whitespace in areas where we feel we not only have permission from our guests to help solve an opportunity, but also, we can do it in a very authentic way. And in this and with Selfcare, it is that notion of how can we solve the needs of the athlete when they're on the go, in studios, as it relates to this category that others are not fulfilling. And very happy with the results of the pilot. We'll continue and expand that into 2019. And obviously, it's a category that I know well. And I feel there's a lot of opportunity. As we think of Selfcare, we think of the sweat life, the ability to continue to bring product that delivers on that objective of how do we solve the needs of the athletes as it relates to this product category. So early results are very good, further expansion in 2019, and we're working as well on that product expansion and see opportunity in this category. It's very exciting. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian (sic) [ Mark ] Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Mark Altschwager from Baird. The product stories have been really impressive in the back half, and I'm just wondering if you can discuss a bit more about your learnings on the outerwear front. The assortment looks bigger year-over-year. And in some cases, you have some really premium price points out there. So where are you finding your sweet spot from a pricing perspective? Any pushback from the customer at the $500-plus levels? And just overall, how meaningful a comp driver do you expect that to be over the holiday period? Sun Choe : We see outerwear being a material comp driver for the quarter both across men's and women's. And I would say, you're right on in terms of the assortment assessment. We have definitely broadened the range as well as broadened the solve and really focusing behind solves around rain, insulation and activity. And the more innovation we put into a product, we do believe that there's a value add for the guest. And so far, we really have not seen price resistance where we've introduced the 3-in-1 or waterproof down and priced it at a premium. So we believe that continuing to innovate on solutions for our guests, and if there's value there, we can continue to push prices up. And at the same time, when we have things that are more like [ shelved ], everyday [ shelf ] that a guest can work out in or run in, that could be something that's a bit more of an opening price point for us. So we actually see a pretty broad price elasticity in this category across men's and women's. Mark Altschwager : That's really helpful. And, Sun, maybe just a follow-up. Can you talk about the gifting strategy in the fourth quarter and what the biggest changes are year-over-year? Sun Choe : I would say, in gifting, we probably went a little deeper into accessories. We always have huge opportunity in our franchise products because those are items that our guests knows and loves, so franchises like Align, Wunder Under, Speed Up that Stuart had alluded to; in men's, our Metal Vent and ABC franchises. And probably new for us is the breadth of giftables that we introduced in accessories across cold weather as well as what we call, small lulu goods. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Just want to ask a couple of questions about some expense buckets that have been sort of topical within the industry. Just on the wages, how is the company addressing that issue with wages kind of going up across retail? And secondly, on rent, as you look into next year, your stores are performing very well, but probably, a lot of stores in retail are not. Are you seeing any opportunities on rent as you move forward into 2019? Patrick Guido : Yes. Jay, it's PJ. So on the retail wages, so within our stores, we target the top 25th percentile. So we feel like we're very competitive on that front. So not seeing pressure there, but we continue to evaluate that. On rent, I think we're not seeing any meaningful opportunities outside the ordinary, so I wouldn't say there's anything there. Stuart Haselden : Yes. Obviously, from the occupancy line, our real estate strategy in international markets as well as we stepped into bigger boxes in North America will reflect those changes in the strategy. But we feel really good that there's opportunity to have a good outcome in terms of occupancy into the future. Jay Sole : Got it. And then if I can just ask one more. As your e-commerce business has grown so well, you've made a lot of investments in the supply chain. How has that affected the amount of returns that you see? And how has that sort of impacted the profitability given how much expansion you see in the margin? Stuart Haselden : It's interesting. We see a very similar level of returns in our e-commerce business as we do in stores. And I know that's different from a lot of businesses, even a lot of vertical retailers that are in categories that see higher levels of return online. And we're just fortunate that our business performed similarly across channels. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : I'm just curious about how you're thinking about the e-com ultimately by geography in terms of what penetration can you achieve by geography. And maybe if you can share where you are now in Canada versus the United States. Those are obviously your 2 more mature markets. So just curious where e-com penetration is there. And then just second, I mean, anything you'd share on the buy online, pick up in-store stores? What's happening in terms of customer behavior, attach [ sales in the stores ]? Stuart Haselden : Paul, it's Stuart. So the -- as you look at digital by geography and the e-commerce penetration, the North American business still is, by far, the lion's share of that business. So it essentially reflects the penetration of the North American business. We're really excited about the trends that we're seeing in Asia and in Europe. There are infrastructure investments we need to make and are making, and you've heard us talk about that to a degree in these international markets to fully unlock the potential. So those are things that we have planned into '19 and beyond to continue to fuel really exciting increases in our e-commerce business in those geographies. And we're likewise really excited about the potential, and we spoke about it earlier on the call, that we see for e-commerce [indiscernible]. So hope that addresses your question. And your second question on buy online, pick up in-store, still early innings on [ that. ] We're seeing some really encouraging results. We're excited to expand it to additional stores. And we'll be able to share more details with you on that into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Stuart, I was really intrigued by some of the supply chain and distribution investments that you talked about ultimately driving your product margin higher over time. I wasn't sure if you had any details you wanted to add, but my question is, does this allow you to sort of think about different gross margin and, ultimately, operating margin targets longer term that would be above some of those targets you've laid out in the past? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Kimberly, it's Stuart. So we're certainly exceeding some of the original goals that we had set back at the beginning of 2015 -- 2016, rather, for the 5-year time horizon. And we are reevaluating and recalibrating how high is high in each part of the business, certainly, each element of the operating profit story. And that's something we'll be able to share more details on with you when we report Q4 and something we've alluded to in terms of the outlook we see in the business beyond 2020 as we really do see opportunity to exceed the goals that we've set for that period. One of the things I did just want to highlight while we still have a few minutes left on the call. We're really pleased with the comp momentum that we saw from Q2 into Q3. And we see essentially the continuation of that same trajectory that we saw in the first half of the year into the second half of the year. And I did just want to reiterate that we are not seeing this trend slow now into the early weeks of Q4. And just to clarify, while we did give slightly different top line comp guidance in the fourth quarter versus the guidance that we offered in Q3, there are a couple of reasons for that, and I just wanted to mention and make sure that investors are aware of this. The first is that we really have the majority of the quarter in front of us. There's some really big volume weeks as we approach Christmas. There is essentially less of the quarter under our belt at this point than when we were at a similar point guiding to Q3. So that's the first element. The second one is we're just lapping stronger comparisons in the fourth quarter of last year. So those 2 factors really came into bear as we laid what the appropriate comp guidance was for us to offer. But I did just want to reiterate that we're seeing the same strong trends from the third quarter now into the early part of the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Very nice quarter. Actually, your comments there just -- really just answered the key question I have with regard to the guidance. So shifting to another question. With regard to spend -- just the investment spend in the third quarter, to understand, you stepped up investments, but the rate of, I guess, SG&A margin was still higher in Q3 than it was in the prior 2 quarters. So was that all reflective of higher investment spending? Patrick Guido : Brian, the vast majority of it was investment, about 2/3 of it. But then we did have some FX headwinds that impacted our SG&A by about 30 basis points. But it was predominantly investment. Stuart Haselden : Yes. And this is Stuart. So I'll just offer, the SG&A outcome in the third quarter was not a surprise. We planned this, and we saw opportunity to lean in farther in certain areas as we saw the strong top line and, in particular, the beat on the gross margin materializing. So investors should view this as the management team leaning into where we see opportunity to fuel growth into the future. And I would say, stepping back from that, we're really pleased with where we're going to land the year and achieve SG&A leverage for a 12-month period for the first time in several years. So this is, I think, evidence of the management team managing the business dynamically while still delivering on the strategic goals that we set out. And you should expect us to be able to deliver SG&A leverage each year as we march towards 2020 and beyond. Brian Nagel : If I could just ask 1 bigger picture follow-up question. Clearly, your entire enterprise is still in the very early stages of growth, and it's a dynamic model. But as we're watching e-commerce now really track very, very well, and I think that someone else pointed out in prior question, well ahead of even the goals you had laid out recently, how -- does that at all cause you to rethink or to think differently about the store model or the store layout? Stuart Haselden : No. I think the -- what you've seen us do over the last several years in terms of adapting new store formats is really building a more agile model to be able to execute a retail a brick-and-mortar strategy tailored to each market in the most effective manner. And what we're seeing on these colocated and experiential stores is more a next chapter in our retail journey where we're going to be able to create exciting space for us to introduce new product categories powerfully as well as create new in-store experiences for our guests that we see shaping more exciting experiences and higher levels of engagement broadly. Operator : This concludes the time allocated for the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Howard Tubin for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks for joining us today, everyone. Happy holidays. And we look forward to speaking to you in a few months when we report our fourth quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to the fourth quarter earnings call. It was another successful quarter for lululemon as the momentum in our business remains strong. In fact, these results cap off one of the strongest years ever for the company. The leadership team is focused on leveraging the significant opportunities in front of us, both over the course of 2019 and in the coming years. And before going any further, I want to take a moment to express our sincere gratitude to our teams around the world. It is our educators, our store teams and our local brand and community partners around the globe who create that special connection with our guests day in and day out.  Turning to our fourth quarter results. We are pleased with how the organization executed exceptionally well over the holiday season. Our preparation and planning allowed us to deliver another quarter of robust performance. And looking at the full year, the results were equally impressive. Our 2018 results demonstrate the strength of lululemon today as we enter the next phase of our growth. Our compelling product assortment, retail experience and community-based brand activations continue to resonate strongly with our guests. Our strategic investments in the business to support our digital expansion and supply chain improvements delivered impressively on both our top and bottom line. All of this, combined with our significant growth outside North America, allowed us to achieve a high level of results for our employees and shareholders.  Looking now at 2019. We are focused on building upon our momentum as we pursue many opportunities on the near-term horizon. Starting with product, we will continue to deliver the newest technical product innovations that lululemon has built upon. We will leverage our strength and success in our core categories, while we also continue to expand and test into new areas where we see category expansion opportunities. In women's, we will expand many high-performing product categories that have driven considerable success including : office travel commute, outerwear and our bra assortment. And of course, we'll continue to innovate and be an industry leader in yoga. Men's is one of our largest and most exciting areas of future growth, both for our current and new guests going forward. We recently launched 2 styles of boxers. And this spring, we'll expand our Fast & Free franchise into men's as we further leverage Nulux to offer men a new solution for warm weather runs. And we remain excited about the Selfcare, given the strong guest response to our tests. We believe this category holds great opportunity for us and is a natural extension for our brand. We continue to attract and acquire new guests while building greater share of wallet with our highly engaged existing guests. And we see many ways to create unique experiences for all of our guests to help them achieve their goals of living the Sweatlife. Our bottoms category continues to perform exceedingly well and has proven to be a strong acquisition point into our brand for both women and men. Our upcoming run campaign builds nicely upon the strength of our brand activations in the past year, and will enable us to develop deeper relationships with existing guests to expand this important category. And we continue to be excited by the potential that our loyalty program holds for our brand. Our first members-only event in Edmonton was a huge success, and we are thrilled with the overall response of the program in this market. We also recently launched the membership test in Denver and we'll extend the test to an additional city in the United States in the coming months.  When looking at our digital ecosystem, we are still in the early stages of our development with so much potential ahead. We've just begun speaking to our guest in a more personalized way, but we are ready to accelerate our capabilities in this area in the coming quarters. We also have additional opportunities to improve the experience our guests have by continuing to enhance our search, navigation and checkout functionality. And we can also improve the way we use our sites for our brand storytelling to drive guest engagement.  Internationally, we are particularly excited to be able to expand our digital reach this year as we launch local market sites in Japan, France and Germany. In addition to our digital growth opportunities, we will continue to strategically expand our store fleet in square footage as we open more stores in new and existing markets, continue the co-located remodel program, build upon the success of our seasonal store strategy and also test some exciting new store formats that create unique experiences for our guests.  Finally, we see significant potential for our brand outside of North America, and we will continue to build upon our recent momentum. China is an area of focus and significant opportunity for us. We are seeing strong success across this market and are pleased to see more and more people living the Sweatlife and engaging with our brand. We will accelerate the pace of new store openings and continue to connect with our guests through local community events and brand activations.  We will also build upon the strength in our digital channel as we see a pathway for this segment to represent 50% of our business in the years to come. In Europe, we will leverage the city-by-city expansion strategy as we add new markets, such as opening our first store in Amsterdam 2 weeks ago. We look forward to sharing more of our international strategy during our Analyst Day next month, which I will describe in just a moment. These are just some of the many areas where we see growth opportunities in the year ahead and beyond. To deliver on these strategies, I'm excited to share that we recently expanded the responsibilities for members of our senior team. The evolved structure builds upon the successful track record of our existing leaders and creates an organization designed for speed, product and category development while focused on guest innovation and global scale. Key elements of our new structure include : Stuart Haselden will now oversee our international business in addition to continuing to serve as our Chief Operating Officer; Celeste Burgoyne will now drive global guest innovation for lululemon while also leading an expanded Americas organization that brings together all of our in-store community and omni-experiences; Sun Choe continues to serve as our Chief Product Officer. And several other senior leaders, including Tom Waller, our Head of Whitespace; and PJ Guido, our Chief Financial Officer, will report to me. In addition, we're creating a new role and function to support and enhance our brand positioning around the world. We've begun an external search for a Chief Brand Officer to lead several areas, including branding, events, partnerships, social impact and sustainability. All of us on the leadership team are energized about our performance in 2018, the opportunities ahead and our outlook for the next 5 years. The team has executed extremely well on our 2020 plan, achieving several milestones ahead of schedule. It's now an ideal time to outline our vision and growth plans for the next 5 years. To provide further insights, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day in New York next month, where we will talk further about our plans and ambitions. In closing, I'm proud to say that we entered 2019 with great momentum and an energized team ready to begin this exciting next chapter in the lululemon growth story. And with that, I'll hand it over to Stuart. Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Calvin. Let me also congratulate our store teams as well as our SSC, GEC and DC teams around the world for enabling the strong results we're reporting today. Without their passion and enthusiasm, none of this will be possible.  In Q4, strong guest response for our holiday merchandise assortment, coupled with our ability to leverage the strategic investments we've been making in the businesses, drove another strong result. The trends we've seen all year in traffic, guest engagement and product margin continued and contributed to our nearly 40% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter. I'm also proud to report that we achieved 3 of our 2020 financial targets in 2018, 2 years ahead of schedule. We reported an operating margin of 21.5%, a gross margin of just over 55% and our e-commerce penetration reached 26%. These levels are all at or above the targets we set for 2020 and were made possible by our investments over the last 3 years in supply chain, technology and innovation. 2018 has clearly been an inflection point for our business in both top and bottom line, and we continue to see clear opportunities to expand on this story by building stronger systems and platforms in supply chain, IT infrastructure, omni capabilities, digital commerce and product development capabilities. This sets us on a new course for 2019 and beyond that we are all excited for.  I'll now offer some details on our Q4 performance. Comps increased a better-than-expected 17% as our traffic remained strong in the quarter. Gross margin expanded 110 basis points, partially offset by planned increases in SG&A as we continued to lean into growth-driving investments in Q4. These investments included omnichannel and digital capabilities to position us well for 2019 and drive our future growth. Operating margin grew 60 basis points versus adjusted operating margin last year and reached 28.4%. In addition, our guest engagement remained high as we continued to drive strong results in both new guest acquisition and our e-mail list, with increases of nearly 30% and 70%, respectively. What's equally exciting are the increases we're also seeing from our existing guests. In Q4, we experienced a 40% increase in transactions by repeat guests.  Let me now turn to some highlights on the quarter. Product remains a foundation from which our success is built, and our offering in Q4 continued to be a standout. We saw ongoing strength in both men's and women's bottoms, which comped up 28% and 21%, respectively. Our expanded outerwear offering also performed well with strong guest demand for our new cold weather styles. We also had success in our collaboration with SoulCycle in January. I'm particularly pleased with the strength here as it helped us drive full price sales in a month that is generally thought to be used for clearance at most other retailers.  Shifting gears to digital. Traffic to our sites grew over 30% in Q4, while conversion increased in the low single-digit range. We partnered with Strava as we leveraged our online and physical ecosystems with the third annual 40/80 Challenge. This year, we had over 200,000 runners join, representing a 90% increase versus last year. This was the largest run event by a brand ever hosted on Strava, and we're excited that with nearly 100,000 members, we are the largest run community on the app.  Finally, our international business also saw strong performance in Q4. Market growth in Asia was over 70% and Europe grew nearly 60%. In China, e-commerce continues to be particularly robust, generating an increase of over 140% in Q4 and over 150% for the full year. I'm also excited to report that we opened our first stores in Osaka and Macao during Q4 and also opened our first-ever airport location in Hong Kong, all delivering strong results as we extend our brand awareness in these regions. And in Europe, we opened an exciting new store in the Mitte district of Berlin, and as Calvin mentioned, we recently opened our first store in Amsterdam. We're excited to see accelerating trends now in Europe as our brand awareness levels continue to increase.  Normally, I'd now share with you our opportunities and initiatives within infrastructure, technology and supply chain. However, I'm going to save that discussion for our Analyst Day. What I would like to express to our investors is the excitement and enthusiasm I have for my new challenge of leading the international business. As Calvin detailed for you earlier, I'll continue as COO but will now bring my lens of operational excellence to our businesses in Asia Pacific and Europe. I've been working closely with the leaders in these regions for the last few years, and I look forward to helping them grow their businesses and achieve the full potential of the lululemon brand outside of North America. Let me now hand it over to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Stuart. Our momentum continued in Q4, and we finished up the year delivering very strong financial performance. Before I provide highlights on Q4 and our guidance outlook, I will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our investor site for additional details. I'd also note that 2018 was a 53-week year for us.  For Q4, total net revenue rose 26% to $1.17 billion, driven by strong execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 7% constant dollar comp store sales increase on top of a 1% increase in Q4 last year. Square footage increased 13% versus last year, driven by the addition of 36 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2017. During the quarter, we opened 14 net new stores and completed 9 co-located remodels. In our digital channel, we saw the strongest traffic over the year, which resulted in a 39% constant dollar comp increase on top of a very strong 42% increase last year. For the quarter, e-comm contributed $344 million of top line, reaching close to 30% of total revenue. For the full year, as Stuart mentioned, e-comm penetration was 26%. And I'd add that the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $14.7 million in the quarter.  Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $668.6 million or 57.3% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 56.2% of net revenue in Q4 2017. The gross profit rate in Q4 increased 110 basis points versus adjusted gross margin last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 170 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns. We are pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of the strong gains over the last several years.  We leveraged occupancy and depreciation expense by 20 basis points, while product and supply chain costs increased by 50 basis points given investment in supply chain and product development. We also saw 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were $337.2 million or 28.9% of net revenue compared to 28.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. In Q4, we continued to use the strength in our business to invest in strategies and initiatives that fuel current and long-term growth. These investments included digital marketing and seasonal store openings to drive guest acquisition and build brand awareness as well as expanded testing for longer-term growth initiatives, including loyalty and Selfcare. Foreign exchange, both revaluation and translation, leveraged by 70 basis points in Q4. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $331 million or 28.4% of net revenue compared to an adjusted 27.8% of net revenue in Q4 2017.  Tax expense for the quarter was $115.8 million or 34.6% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 53.5% a year ago. As we finalized our prior year state tax returns and interpreted ongoing guidance, we incurred an incremental tax expense of $2.3 million or $0.02 per share related to the onetime transition tax that was enacted as part of U.S. Tax Reform. We also incurred a tax expense of $23.7 million or $0.18 per share related to the repatriation of $780 million of cash from our Canadian subsidiary to our U.S. parent. Excluding these charges, the adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.9% compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 30.6% in Q4 last year. The decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate relative to our prior guidance relates primarily to a change in recent tax legislation that will allow us to benefit from certain foreign tax credits that were previously not available to us. This change contributed to the reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate for 2018 to 28% and benefited EPS in Q4 by approximately $0.07. We expect our tax rate for 2019 to remain at approximately 28%. Net income for the quarter was approximately $218 million or $1.65 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.88 for the first -- fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding discrete tax items and ivivva restructuring costs, adjusted EPS in Q4 2018 was $1.85 versus adjusted EPS of $1.33 in Q4 of 2017.  Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million for the quarter compared to approximately $51 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for both new locations and renovations and IT and supply chain investment.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $881 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 23% and was $405 million at the end of Q4. We repurchased 1.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $121. This repurchase activity substantially completed our $600 million authorization put in place earlier in 2018. Coming into 2019, our board has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan. We believe that repurchasing our shares is an efficient and effective way to return excess cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with our repurchase activity.  Turning now to our outlook. For Q1, we expect revenues to be in the range of $740 million to $750 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the first quarter of 2018. This also assumes 12 new store openings in the quarter. We expect gross margin to expand modestly versus Q1 of last year. Although we are anniversary-ing strong increases in product margin, we are still focused on further gross margin expansion through incremental reduction in average unit cost driven by ongoing supply chain initiatives and scale efficiencies. We expect the SG&A rate in Q1 to be flat to up modestly as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our business that fuel top line momentum. Assuming a tax rate of 28% and approximately 132 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70 versus EPS of $0.55 a year ago.  For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.7 million to $3.74 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double digits on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open approximately 40 to 50 company-operated stores in 2019. This includes 25 to 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the mid-teens range.  We expect gross margin for the year to expand modestly, primarily driven by continued product margin improvement and leverage on occupancy and other fixed costs. We expect SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly. We expect our fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.55. Our EPS guidance is based on 132 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 28% in 2019. We have assumed the Canadian dollar at $0.75 to the U.S. dollar for 2019 as well as Q1. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $265 million to $275 million for the fiscal year 2019. The increase versus 2018 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, new store openings, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects. In closing, we remain excited with the momentum we're seeing in the business as we enter 2019, and I look forward to seeing many of you in New York at our Analyst Day.  And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Steven Zaccone : This is Steve Zaccone on for Matt. First question, just on product. You've seen amazing strength in the bottoms business in 2018. Do you think that category can continue to be a significant driver of growth in 2019 or do you see some other focus areas for product growth in 2019? Then just secondly, on SG&A, to understand the cadence there in the first quarter and then versus the full year guide, but how should we think about the second quarter through the fourth quarter just on the leverage line? Calvin McDonald : I'll take the question on product, and then PJ will take your question on SG&A. We see a wonderful path forward for our product both in our core as well as our ability to continue to expand the categories that we're offering our guests. Our bottoms business not only is our #1 category for acquiring new guests, which are continuing to help drive and fuel that, but it's also an area in which we continue to innovate both across men's and women's. So we remain very encouraged with the continual performance of the business in 2018 and moving into 2019. As well as our ability to expand upon categories across all of our guests, existing and new, and that being to OTC, outerwear, bras, and into men's and the other categories, Selfcare and Run, just to name a few that I mentioned. So I'm very encouraged with how our categories are performing as well as into 2019 both on innovation and newness. Patrick Guido : And Steve, so on the SG&A question, so just to start. We've committed to and delivered SG&A leverage for the year. And improving profitability is part of our ongoing objective, and that's reflected in our guidance. That said, we've been using good performance during the course of the year to find pockets to invest in long-term sustainable growth, and it's working. We're seeing results there. Specifically, during the quarter, we invested more in digital marketing that was focused more on guest acquisition. And as mentioned earlier, we saw our new guest acquisition up 30% for the quarter. We also expanded our testing in new growth vehicles such as loyalty and Selfcare, and we also continue to operate a higher level of seasonal stores, which is a great way to also acquire new guests and build brand awareness. It's also a low-risk way to test markets for the eventual potential conversion to a full-on store, and we've done several of those as well. So if not for these discretionary strategic investments, we would have seen SG&A flat or even leveraging. Operator : Our next question is from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : My question is on what the biggest drivers are of your confidence in that double-digit comp guide for 2019. You went into some color in response to the last question on some of the categories that are expected to drive that growth. I wonder if you could share some thoughts on how the growth is expected to split between stores and e-commerce or anything you can share on ticket and traffic or any other drivers of the confidence there. Patrick Guido : Alex, it's PJ. I'll start off just with traffic has been the key driver throughout 2018, and we expect that momentum has carried over. It always starts with great product and assortment as mentioned. But then we support and fuel that with physical engagement with our guests -- through our guest educators, through community events, our network of over 2,000 ambassadors. Then there's the online dialogue, where we drive traffic both online and in-store through our digital marketing programs, and I think e-mail is a great example of that. We saw higher traffic in Q4 -- higher traffic in Q4 than in any other point in the year, and as I mentioned, we see that carrying over into 2019. Online traffic, also a key driver of e-comm performance was the big component. But we've also seen big gains in conversion as a result of continuing enhancements to our website, which we'll continue to make. So then coming into 2019, we'll continue to fuel traffic, but we'll also invest to improve conversion both online and in-store. Alexandra Walvis : Great. And you mentioned in your comments that you were excited about Selfcare following some of the tests in that category. Anything you can share with us for what's next there? Calvin McDonald : Other than that, we were happy with the test results, and we're excited to share more on our plans around Selfcare as well as some additional categories on our Analyst Day with you. Operator : Our next question is from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Following up on the seasonal stores. I'm just wondering, you launched -- you opened 2x the amount this year versus last year. I was wondering if you can give us any insight into the range of outcomes that you experienced and maybe the surprises that you had versus maybe in terms of positive surprises or negative surprises from opening that many stores. I'm just trying to get a little bit more color as you advance down that channel. Patrick Guido : Yes. Matt, it's PJ. Well, I mean, the positive surprise is obviously the new guest acquisition that we're able to measure, and so we're really excited about seeing that. The other positive surprise, again, I mentioned seasonal stores are a great way to gauge a market. And we actually converted 8 of those -- or we'll be converting 8 of those to full-on stores in 2019. So those are the positives. Not a whole lot of negatives there. It's a low-risk way to build your brand, to build new guests. And we really like that as a strategy. Matthew McClintock : Okay. And then staying with marketing, you signed Nick Foles during the quarter, and I was wondering if you could talk to that. Or maybe this is a topic for the Investor Day, I apologize. But it would seem like there's a little bit of shift in terms of the marketing or signing or finding brand ambassadors towards maybe more higher-profile people. Could you maybe talk to that a little bit? Is there a bigger budget for that now? Or how should we think about that from the outside? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. Yes, we're excited with the signing of Nick into the elite ambassador family here at lululemon. But I would indicate that it's not a new strategy for us. He's definitely a very high-profile athlete. But we're excited to have him. I think when we look at our ambassador community of 2,000-plus strong and our global and elite ambassadors, it is an area that we're excited to continue to expand. We do not pay typical endorsement fees. We really look to partner with athletes that have an alignment on values. The athletes are authentic that they love the brand. And collectively, we come together excited about the partnership and the potential impact that we can both have in the community and with our guests living the Sweatlife. And with Nick, he's a wonderful ambassador and representative of those things, so we're excited. And it is an area that we think we can continue to expand on and we'll share more on the Analyst Day. Operator : Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : I want to focus on international profitability. I don't know if this is for Stuart or PJ. But maybe you can you let us know where international profitability kind of landed at the end of this year. Any surprises, good or bad, on where you're scaling, both in Asia and in Europe? And then the kind of expectations maybe that's embedded in your guidance for the next 12 months on international margins. Stuart Haselden : Sure. Ike, it's Stuart, and I apologize. My voice is a little hoarse. Let me -- I'll try to give a little color on our profitability. We're not going to be able to break out the specifics, but what we can say is that we saw strong profitability in Asia and in Australia that more than offsets the operating loss that we saw in Europe. We're still probably 1.5 years from breakeven in Europe but really excited at the momentum that we're seeing in our European business now. And as we mentioned on the call, we saw strong sequential trends in both Asia and Europe. Asia, up 70%; Europe, up 60% in the fourth quarter. That was an acceleration sequentially from the third quarter. And as we also mentioned, we're going to open 25 to 30 stores in 2019 internationally. That's more than half of the total stores that we'll open as a company. The balance of those or more than half of those will be in Asia. And we're seeing strong trends, strong comp trends in both China and broadly across Asia as well as Australia and Europe. I would say in Europe, we've actually seen an acceleration in our store comps. That's been exciting as we are reaching levels of brand awareness that we believe are now helping us achieve that faster pace of comp growth. But overall, I think just the store count reflects the importance of this as one of our growth drivers. We'll certainly offer more details at the Analyst Day. But it will continue to be an area where we're growing our business disproportionate to North America. And the profitability we're excited to see really reaching a point where we're reaching a scale economies situation in Asia, in particular, where we're now seeing very healthy bottom line results. So we'll share more, as I mentioned, on the Analyst Day, but that's, I think, some headlines we can offer now. Irwin Boruchow : And Stuart, could you just maybe talk about between Europe and Asia, is there anything structural that precludes Europe from scaling their margins? I'm just kind of understanding why Europe is kind of lagging and Asia, kind of the puts and takes? Stuart Haselden : Yes. We have 21 stores in Europe right now. We have 34 in Asia. The stores in Asia tend to have a bigger sales volume than we've seen in Europe. So it's really a function of just the productivity of the store fleet. Importantly, we're also investing aggressively in our digital business internationally. So we're going to open -- or I'd say we're going to launch new websites in France, Germany, China, Japan and Korea, all in the first half of this year, which will dramatically improve our ability to engage with our guests in those regions digitally. But really, it's just as a question of reaching the volume in Europe to leverage our overhead investments there. So we're confident we'll get there, and we're pleased with the progress we're seeing. Operator : Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I was hoping you could maybe talk about North America and how the comps are trending in North America relative to the rest of the world. And if you're still seeing healthy comp growth in North America, which I suspect you are, how does Asia in particular look relative to the U.S. or Canada at a similar age? Patrick Guido : Yes. Sharon, it's PJ. So I mean, North America, obviously, it's a bigger part of our business, close to -- it's 90%, right? So our international is roughly 10%, 11% but growing at a much faster rate. So we're actually seeing it start to move the needle. So the comp is driven primarily by the U.S. and Canada. And we're seeing traffic continue, good traffic, we're seeing good comp, both in-store and online. So really happy with the way North America has performed and continues to perform. Stuart Haselden : So Sharon, it's Stuart. From an international standpoint, our stores are younger, and you would expect that they would comp at a higher rate in the first few years of their sort of lifespan as a comp store. That's the case in North America and it's certainly also the case in our international markets. We have -- we still -- we certainly have a brand awareness obstacle to overcome in our international markets, but as we're beginning to gain traction in our community efforts and our brand building efforts, we're seeing that comps accelerate particularly in Europe, as I mentioned. But we're seeing very healthy strong comp trends across our international markets. That would be what you would expect, I think, in terms of the relative age and cohort -- age cohort, if you will, of those stores. Operator : Our next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Can you talk a little bit about the loyalty program, the learnings from it? And is the package of the loyalty program, is it the same or has it been tweaked? And just on the product margin, thoughts on product margin for 2019. And unpack the components of it and how you're looking at it. Calvin McDonald : Dana, it's Calvin. On the loyalty program, we've been very happy with the test and pilot so far. As you know, we initially tested in Edmonton, and we've just recently tested in Denver. And our intent over the coming months is to select a few more markets and keep testing. Response from our guests has been very positive. It's exceeded our expectations in both markets. We did test a different price point in Denver. We launched at CAD 128 in Edmonton. We tested USD 148 in Denver and saw wonderful take-up. So it sort of confirmed our thinking, which is there's real value in the memberships. The guest is understanding the value and the demand is there for us. So we're very encouraged and will continue to test as we look into expanding the program and ultimately leading into a national program in the coming sort of quarters to a year. Patrick Guido : And on your gross margin question, Dana, so we do see continued upside in the gross margin, specifically driven by product margin. We've guided to modest expansion, and we have a lot of confidence in that. The opportunity is coming from additional scale. It's coming from vendor diversification. It's coming from closer partnerships with existing vendors, having transparency into cost we haven't necessarily had in the past. And it's also enhancing our distribution network. So we do see, again, continued expansion on the product side. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Just curious how you're thinking about F '19 comps from a store versus e-comm perspective? Also if you can maybe share how you're thinking about North America versus international. And then just second, the SoulCycle partnership, curious if you see any other opportunities to do something similar, either in the U.S., Canada or international. Patrick Guido : So from a comp perspective, we can't talk about too much beyond Q1. And just broad strokes, the traffic patterns we've seen all year at both online and in-store, there's -- the split is we would expect that to continue. I don't know that there's any huge directional change either way. But yes, we expect the stores to continue to comp well, and we're seeing the traffic to back that up. And certainly, our online business, we're really excited about. Calvin McDonald : And Paul, on the collaborations, we've done collaborations. We're excited when we do it both with a sweat partner, like SoulCycle. And yes, we continue to do more of these and we have some exciting ones planned for 2019 that we'll be announcing and launching to our guests in the coming months. In addition, we also are excited about certain collaborations with designers, where we can bring their particular view on aesthetic with our technical view on product, like the Robert Geller, and we're seeing a wonderful response to that announcement. And that product is pending to be launching very soon and anticipate great demand as well as sort of the ability to attract the new men's guests into our business. So collaborations have been performing well. We see them on both sweats and aesthetic design partner opportunities. And it's bringing in new guests and expanding the basket with our existing guests. So we'll continue to do them. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Gabriella Carbone : This is Gabby Carbone on for Paul. So our question is on the men's business. You're seeing very strong results there. What categories have the largest opportunities for growth? And then we discussed the opportunities to build out more co-located stores, but what are you seeing in terms productivity at these stores versus your traditional format? Stuart Haselden : Gabby, it's Stuart. So we're really excited with the trends at our men's business. As we mentioned, we offered a couple of nuggets in the prepared remarks. It's growing faster than our women's business. Our men's pants has been one of the fastest growing categories within men's. It's become an important way in which we acquire new guys to the brand. And at this point, it's larger actually than our performance tops business, which had -- prior to the last year had been the largest category. So we're excited to see the trends in men's pants. Outerwear has been another success story for us in 2018. A huge increase in our admittedly small outerwear business in men's, which is just an indication of us -- an indication to us rather, how big this business could be. So we're excited to introduce new styles in outerwear as well as in our performance business. And we'll have a nice balance between our technical performance style as well as our -- what we call office travel commute styles, outerwear among them. So there's a lot of runway for us to continue to grow our men's business. We're just over 20% penetration today. We really believe that lululemon can be a dual-gender brand, and that our men's business can ultimately be as big as our women's. And from a channel standpoint, you mentioned co-located. That is an important part of the story. We see huge increases in our productivity of our co-located stores, which are essentially stores that are space constrained, very productive locations that we're able to either expand or find a larger location nearby so that we can have a more effective presentation of our men's product and have an environment that's more appealing to guys to shop in. So we're seeing increases, for example, in our Mall of America location, where we expanded the square footage from 3,000 to 5,000 square feet. We doubled the size of our men's shop there, and we saw our sales in men's up 80%, with essentially the same inventory. Now every co-located expansion is not that successful, but that's a good example of the success that we've seen. But it is an important part of the story for men's and our North American store footprint broadly. And we're still testing just how deep we can go in the portfolio with our strategy. Operator : Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Stuart, my question is on international. I'm wondering the international sales growth rate seems to be hitting more broadly an inflection, particularly in Europe, over the last year or so. And I was wondering if you could just talk about -- I'm sure there are many contributing factors, but what do you think is driving that inflection? And understanding that in North America, the brand started out as a women's brand and it's growing in men's. It was sort of a dual-gender brand for example, when you brought it to Asia. Are you seeing maybe higher penetration in men's in Asia relative to North America? Or any other learnings on the international front with regard to men's? Stuart Haselden : Yes. Thanks, Kimberly. Good questions. What I would say is we have a really strong team in Europe led by Gareth Pope, our GM there. And Gareth has done a lot of great work over the last couple of years to reposition, if you will, a number of our stores -- the real estate strategy broadly in Europe. And we found success in Gareth's leadership there. And we continue to invest behind it. And as I mentioned, we've been patient and deliberate in the community building activities in Europe. It's taken us a bit longer than we originally expected. But we're now starting to see traction and momentum there from a guest acquisition and brand awareness standpoint, which we believe is what we attribute the acceleration in the comp in Europe to. So we're thrilled to see that trend. And we'll be evaluating just how we continue to invest behind that, the strategy that Gareth and the team has set in Europe. And good question around men's and how we think about that internationally. We do have the opportunity to introduce the brand as a dual-gender business, dual-gender brand in these international markets where we're not as well known, obviously. And we have taken steps to do that. I would say the mix of business is not remarkably different in our international markets versus North America. We still hold that as an opportunity. And we're evaluating how in markets like Asia, we can show up with a stronger men's positioning. And that's something we can talk more about when we're together at the Analyst Day. Operator : Our next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Just kind of curious about the guidance for 1Q. Can you just talk about how the Easter shift might be impacting your business in terms of like just what kind of natural lift you expect in April from where you are today just because of how the calendar falls this year? Patrick Guido : Yes. So we would see -- that's a good thing, right, because you have that extra week. And so we are -- we would see -- we would expect the better part -- the best part of the quarter yet to come. And having that late Easter is usually beneficial. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Just circling back to the trend with the co-located stores and the expanded stores, I apologize if I missed it. But can you talk about how you're thinking about the pace of renovations and expansions in 2019 and beyond? And then, I think the success with that initiative speaks to some of the constraints you had in the smaller stores in terms of merchandising the expanded assortment, especially in men's. Maybe talk about some of the digital and omnichannel strategies you're leaning into to ensure you're fully capturing that opportunity from the broad base... Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Mark. On the co-located, we've seen very positive results in 2018, and our intent for 2019 is to maintain the number, which is in and around 20. We are planning to open more new doors this year in the 40 to 50 range, with China picking up a disproportionate number of those incremental doors. So overall, the amount of incremental square footage is in the mid-teen growth range, which is up from 2018. And that's all positive based on how the guest is responding to our assortments, our ability to express our assortment in more locations and are really pleased with the mix. In addition, as you mentioned, we are looking to expand on our omni innovation. We have a very strong BBR program, and that is where our stores access our extended assortment online in order for the guests to either have it shipped to the store for pickup and/or to the guest's home. And very pleased with the results of that, and that continues to grow year-over-year and does help in our smaller doors. But it also helps in our larger doors as well as we continue to add to our assortment and breadth of categories. On buy online, pick up in-store, we tested that over the holiday period in around 35 doors. We're pleased with the results. We are rolling that out across the network, and we plan to be across all doors by holiday 2019, which will give us a wonderful opportunity to promote and move that further up in the guest journey and experience online to make it very clear and aware that, that service exists. But those omni initiatives, combined with how we're approaching our store fleet, both are going to be contributing to the momentum this year. Mark Altschwager : That's great. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a goal of 50% digital penetration longer term. Maybe without previewing too much from the Analyst Day, just curious how you think about that pathway to 50%. How much of it is coming from your mature markets versus maybe higher digital penetration in some of your new international markets? Calvin McDonald : Thanks for clarifying through your question, Mark. That reference was to our business, particularly in China. We see our dotcom business achieving a 50% ratio. We're very excited about our digital direct-to-consumer business overall, and we'll share at the Analyst Day how we view that across all markets. But that particular statement was linked to China. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Jamie Merriman : My question was actually about digital channel. So your margins in digital are frankly, extremely impressive, and I don't know that I've seen them elsewhere in the industry. So I was wondering, are there investments that you still need to make as you scale that business up further as penetration increases? Or as you see that mix shift continue, would you expect to be able to maintain margins at that frankly, again, fantastic level? Stuart Haselden : Jamie, it's Stuart. We are very happy with our digital margins. And as we grow that business faster, it is accretive to our overall operating margin. And I think there's specifics within our business. Our return rates, in particular, are very low, which helps explain why we enjoy a better rate -- margin rate online than other companies. But what I would say in terms of as we look forward and what investments we need to make, we don't feel like we're world champions yet in digital e-commerce, and there's a lot of opportunities we see with the website, with social media, with digital marketing, where we can do much better. And so the upside there is a nice runway of revenue growth in our digital business. So we're excited about that. Operator : Our last question is from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Rafe Jadrosich : I wanted to just follow up on some of your comments about the innovation pipeline. At the beginning of the call, you mentioned category expansion opportunities. Can you just give a little bit more color on what's happening there? And then for 2019, will you be launching any new fabrics? Or is there opportunity to expand some of your existing fabrics into more categories? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Rafe. Much of that we'll be sharing at the Analyst Day. But what I will queue up is 2. One, from a fabric standpoint, we're excited with the continual performance of our existing. Equally, we see opportunity in sharing well-performing technical fabrics across both men's and women's, which is a big opportunity for us, and we'll share how we're approaching innovation on that Analyst Day. As well as a lot of the categories that we're looking to expand. The one that I will tee up, which will be in market prior to us meeting in April, is run and our run campaign, which we're excited about building on the success of yoga as a key sweat for us. Run is an opportunity for us to continue to grow with our existing guests. Stuart mentioned some of the success of our events, both physical and digital. And our assortment and being known as a run destination for apparel, technical apparel, both for men's and women's, is a large opportunity and we'll be launching in the next week an exciting campaign that will start to build the awareness around that sweat activity, and we see a lot of exciting future growth potential behind that as well. More to share at the Analyst Day. Operator : This concludes the time allocated for our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks, everybody, for your interest. And we look forward to seeing many of you in New York next month at our Analyst Day. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.",

Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; Stuart Haselden, COO and EVP International; and PJ Guido, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecasts of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but which, by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our Investors site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I will turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call. As we begin, I would first like to say how much I enjoyed hosting our recent Analyst Day meeting in New York. We are incredibly excited about the growth opportunities we have in front of us, and we look forward to delivering on our 5-year growth plan.  lululemon had another successful quarter, driven by many strengths in our business across product, channel and geography. Our innovative merchandise assortments and our engagement with guests around the world enables the financial results we're proud to report to you today. On today's call, I'll start by sharing some of our key highlights from quarter 1, including how we're [ leaning ] into our product innovation and omni guest experience growth pillars. Going forward, I will periodically ask a member of our senior leadership to join the call and provide an update on key strategic areas of the business. Today, Stuart Haselden will join us to provide an update on our opportunities in China and other key international markets. As you know, earlier this year, Stuart's responsibilities were expanded to include serving as our EVP of International in addition to his role as Chief Operating Officer. Following the global update, PJ Guido will provide a detailed financial review as well as our guidance outlook. I'll then wrap up a few closing comments, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Let's have a look at our first quarter results. We are very pleased to see continued strong momentum in the business. The Power of Three growth plan, which we detailed at Analyst Day, is serving as a driving force to move us forward to achieve our 5-year growth plans. Across the company, teams are executing at extremely high levels. In Q1, our total revenue grew by 20%, constant dollar comps increased 16% on top of a 19% increase last year and earnings per share increased 35%. Our guests responded well to both our men's and women's assortments. They engaged with us across channels as our store and digital businesses were both strong, and our brand continues to resonate well in our core North American market as well as in Europe and APAC. Supporting our growth, we are leveraging the strategic infrastructure investments we're making across the business. Our focus over the last several years to create efficiencies and to further segment our supply chain is paying off and tangibly contributing to our success. As an example, our newest distribution center in Toronto opened on schedule in May and enables us to deliver product more effectively and efficiently in Eastern Canada. As you know, the growth plans we discussed during Analyst Day are long term in nature, and the financial targets we provided are annual. I'm pleased 2019 is off to such a strong start, and we're beginning to live into our 5-year vision.  I'd now like to speak specifically about the Power of Three growth pillars : product innovation, omni guest experience and market expansion. As you recall, our 5-year vision details our path to double our men's business, double our digital business and quadruple our international business during this time. Let me now provide some highlights from quarter 1 for these drivers. When looking at our product innovation pillar, over the next 5 years, we expect annual growth in our core women's business to be in the low double digits, while men's is planned to grow at 20% per year. In quarter 1, we continued to see robust performance in our women's business with particular strength in bottoms. This category remains one of our strongest with comps up over 19%, driven by both leggings and jogger styles. Within the men's business, comps grew 26% with ongoing strength in both tops and bottoms. The business was led by our ABC franchise and 3 core short styles : T.H.E. Short, Pace Breaker and Surge. Guests are responding well to our new boxers designed to address all 3 elements of the science of feel, touch, temperature and movement. Looking forward, I'm excited with the innovation we intend to bring into our assortments for both men and women. Just to preview some of the upcoming highlights for men, we plan to launch a new and improved Metal Vent Tech collection. And for women, we plan to further expand our technical bra offering with 2 high support styles in the coming months. The final component of our product innovation plan is to test into new categories. The main driver continues to be our core categories across both men's and women's. However, we've identified several areas of whitespace where we can test the waters and bring innovation to our guests. One example of this is Selfcare, which we will roll out to 50 stores and online next week. Shifting now to omni guest experience. We had strong results across our channels with our store comps increasing 8% on top of 6% increase last year. Our digital business grew 35%, which represents a more than doubling of the business over the last 2 years. Increased traffic in quarter 1 is driving our comps both in-store and online with increases of 8% and 41%, respectively.  We're excited about our vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people living the Sweatlife. Next month, you'll see our first truly experiential store when we open Lincoln Park in Chicago. This 20,000-square-foot store captures who we are as a brand as it will embody the Sweatlife through multiple studios, a meditation space, a healthy juice and food offering and areas for community gatherings. This distinct environment will provide us additional opportunities to explore and learn as we connect with our guests in a range of new and exciting ways. We also continue to test our membership program, and in May, we expanded to our third pilot city in Austin, Texas. We are very encouraged by the results, and each city in our test has brought new learnings and innovations as we look to scale the program.  Looking now at our digital business. We further expanded our online-only size and color offerings for both men and women. We expanded our buy online, pick up in-store capability from 35 stores to 150 in quarter 1 with 80% of the orders ready for guest pickup in 1 hour. We remain on track for a full rollout by the end of quarter 3. We also significantly improved our mobile point-of-sale capabilities so educators can complete our guest purchases from anywhere in the store. Our strength and unique position is to activate great product across our omni guest experiences, leveraging our stores, community and events. Run is a key strategy for us and a great representation of how we will activate across our entire business to deliver an exceptional guest experience.  In addition to our strong and light bra franchise, we rolled out the Fast & Free run-oriented collection for men. We highlighted the strength of our technical apparel with our global run campaign featuring our first global run ambassador, Charlie Dark. Our run-focused activations during the quarter included a presence at the Boston, Los Angeles and London marathons, and just last week, we celebrated Global Running Day by rallying our community to participate with their local run clubs or to join our 5K challenge on Strava.  In the coming weeks, you'll see us sponsor our 10K runs in Toronto and Edmonton as we've done the last several years, and we plan to add more events going forward. Run is an important category for us with significant potential, and we see opportunities to expand our share of wallet with current and future guests. Shifting gears now to our markets. Let me share some highlights regarding performance in our core region of North America and then turn it over to Stuart to discuss growth in our international markets.  First, our opportunities in North America, our largest region, remain significant. Our innovative merchandise assortment, agile store formats, inspiring brand activations and unique event offerings provide ample ways to engage with existing and new guests. In quarter 1, revenue in North America grew 18% as momentum in this region remains strong. We opened 6 stores in the U.S. and Canada and remain on track to open 15 to 20 in 2019. Our guest stats remain robust with continued growth in new guest acquisition and increased spending across existing guests. Traffic to our stores in North America was strong and grew in the high single-digit range. Last month, Stuart and I had the opportunity to visit our team in China and to see the incredible growth opportunities firsthand. I'll let him share our insights and some of the results this quarter internationally. Stuart? Stuart Haselden : Thanks, Calvin. In May, I was able to spend nearly 2 weeks with our team in China. And while we are seeing exciting momentum across all of our international markets, China in particular is on track to post impressive growth this year. In Q1, our China team delivered nearly 70% market growth and entered 3 new cities with strong store openings in Chongqing, Xi'an and Xiamen. And we remain on track to open 10 to 15 stores in China this year. We also continue to invest in our digital capabilities here with the relaunch of our .cn site in Q1 to complement our presence on Tmall and WeChat. And these investments are paying off as we saw our China e-com revenues increase over 100% in Q1. These results also include the great success of our super brand day event with Tmall in April. As part of this event, we invited 400 guests to join us at the InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland for sweat sessions, meditation classes and also a function show. The event garnered significant attention from the media and on social channels, and it was a great way for us to connect with both new and existing guests. All of this contributed to a strong performance for our Asia Pacific region overall in Q1 with revenues for the region increasing approximately 40%. Other highlights include the launch of our .jp and .kl websites, both of which are seeing strong starts.  Turning now to Europe. We posted strong double-digit comps across all channels driven by ongoing robust traffic increases. These results helped us deliver over 40% market growth in Q1 across Europe. We're pleased to see our business gaining momentum as our community and brand-building efforts accelerate. We also opened a great new store in Amsterdam. At the grand opening, which I was able to attend in March, it was exciting to see firsthand the energy that our team in Europe is creating, which is reflected in the strong results we are now experiencing. And we remain on track to open 5 to 10 new stores this year across Europe. Overall, our international growth remains strong and accounts for an increasing portion of our total company growth. And finally, I'd like to offer my gratitude to our teams around the world. It's only with their great work that any of this is possible. And now I'll pass it to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Stuart. Before I provide highlights on Q1 and our guidance outlook, I will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our Investors site for additional details. For Q1, total net revenue rose 20% to $782 million, driven by strong execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered an 8% constant dollar comp store sales increase on top of a 6% increase in Q1 of last year. Square footage increased 15% versus last year, driven by the addition of 44 net new lululemon stores since Q1 of 2018. During the quarter, we opened 15 new stores.  In our digital channel, we posted a 35% constant dollar comp increase on top of a very strong 60% increase last year. For the quarter, e-com contributed approximately $210 million of top line, reaching nearly 27% of total revenue. And I'd add that the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenue by $12.5 million in the quarter. Gross profit for the first quarter was $421.7 million or 53.9% of net revenue compared to 53.1% of net revenue in Q1 2018. The gross profit rate in Q1 increased 80 basis points versus gross margin last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 190 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns. We are pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of the strong gains over the last several years. This increase was partially offset by a 60 basis point increase in product and supply team costs driven by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain and an increase in occupancy and depreciation expense of 20 basis points. We also saw 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were $293 million or 37.4% of net revenue compared to 37% of net revenue for the same period last year. In Q1, we continued to use the strength in the business to invest in strategic priorities, brand awareness and initiatives that fuel current and long-term growth. This includes digital, loyalty and Selfcare. Foreign exchange, both revaluation and translation, leveraged by 30 basis points in Q1. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $129 million or 16.5% of net revenue compared to 16.1% of net revenue in Q1 2018. Tax expense for the quarter was $34.6 million or 26.4% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.9% a year ago. The decrease in our effective tax rate relative to our guidance reflects the impact of higher tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. These deductions benefited EPS in Q1 by approximately $0.02. We still expect our tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 28%. Net income for the quarter was $96.6 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.55 for the first quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures were approximately $68 million for the quarter compared to approximately $34 million in the first quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and IT and supply chain investment. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $576 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 19% and was $443 million at the end of Q1. I'd also note that pursuant to the new lease accounting standard, ASC 842, we added a lease-related asset of $627 million and lease-related liabilities totaling $665 million to our balance sheet. This new accounting standard has no impact on our income statement or cash flows. We repurchased 1 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $163.5 million. Coming into 2019, our Board authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan, of which approximately $337 million of authorization remains. We believe that repurchasing our shares is an efficient and effective way to return excess cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with our repurchase activity. Turning now to our outlook. For Q2, we expect revenues to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double digits on a constant-dollar basis compared to the second quarter of 2018. This also assumes 5 new store openings in the quarter. We expect gross margin to be flat to up modestly versus Q2 of last year. Our guidance reflects a modest impact from potential new tariffs and also additional costs to airfreight product in order to avoid anticipated port congestion in the Asia region due to the pending tariff increases. The negative impact of these costs will be approximately 20 to 25 basis points within gross margin and approximately $0.04 to $0.05 on EPS for the full year 2019. Most of the impact would come in the back half of the year with the majority in Q3. I should note that roughly $0.02 to $0.03 of this impact would be incurred regardless of whether new tariffs are imposed. We are committing to higher airfreight usage as a hedge against disruption in ocean shipping lanes as we approach the key dates related to tariff increases. This will ensure delivery of new product for our guests on time. We expect the SG&A rate in Q2 to be flat as we continue to invest in growth drivers for our business that fuel top line momentum. We see larger opportunity to leverage SG&A in the back half of the year and we continue to expect modest leverage on the year. Assuming a tax rate of 28% and approximately 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88 versus EPS of $0.71 a year ago. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.73 billion to $3.77 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double digits on a constant-dollar basis. We continue to expect to open approximately 40 to 50 company-operated stores in 2019. This includes 25 to 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the mid-teens range. We expect gross margin for the year to expand modestly primarily driven by continued product margin improvement. We expect SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly. We expect our fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.58. Our EPS guidance is based on 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This range takes into account approximately $0.04 to $0.05 of additional costs within gross margin related to the tariffs and airfreight that I mentioned earlier.  We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 28% in 2019. We assume the Canadian dollar at $0.75 to the U.S. dollar for 2019 as well as Q2. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $265 million to $275 million for the fiscal year 2019. This increase versus 2018 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, new store openings, technology investments and other corporate infrastructure projects.  In closing, we remain excited with the momentum we're seeing in the business as our teams are executing our Power of Three strategic plan. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, PJ. While it's been reported there is some recent softening in the apparel space, there is no doubt that 2019 is off to a great start for us. We are building upon momentum of the past year and instilling confidence in our long-term growth plans. With each new market and innovation, we are inspired by the way in which our guests, both existing and new to the brand, are responding to lululemon. Our vision to ignite a community of people to live the Sweatlife is resonating strongly with guests and provides many growth opportunities for us ahead. We remain laser focused on leveraging our strengths and creating opportunities to ensure lululemon continues to rise above the near-term challenges being faced by others. I'd like to thank our teams around the world for the passion and spirit they bring with them to work every day. Their dedication to our guests and energy for our brand makes this level of sustained performance possible. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter, guys. I guess maybe first, could you elaborate on the current momentum that you're seeing in the business, if you've seen any impact from the recent lateral apparel softness that you mentioned and just how you'd rank back half opportunities maybe by category? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Sure, Matt. In terms of Q2, we remain very happy with the momentum we're seeing in the business, which is reflected in our comp guidance of the plus low double digit, which is on top of a 19% last year. So the business has continued to see very strong trading into the quarter. And that growth is coming across all levers of the Power of Three. In product, our men's business, as we shared, up 33%, continues to be very strong across all categories : tops, boxers and the bottom business. And our women's business equally is showing very solid and very strong growth, in particular, bottoms, driven by leggings and joggers. And we -- with what we're going to be launching in terms of newness, that momentum, we believe, will continue as we continue to feed the core with more innovation and test and learn into new categories and build out the key categories we want to win, being yoga, train and run. So we feel very good about the product launches that are dropping and the momentum and the way the guest is reacting to the product as they see it. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Let me add my congrats. I guess I'm going to throw this question to Stuart. It's very compelling stuff you've got on China with the .cn rollout. I guess just over time, Stuart, can you maybe talk about how you see the mix of your digital business in China, the .cn site versus Tmall, and then maybe relative profitability between the 2, if there's any nuances we should keep in mind? Stuart Haselden : Sure, Ike. So the business vision that we have for China is certainly more heavily considered from a digital standpoint than North America. As we've said in some of our prior conversations, we can see the business in China being 50% online. And the structure of the industry in China is also important in creating that environment to make that possible. And when I say that structure, I think part of that is the marketplace structure that we're all aware of with WeChat and Tmall and the dominance that they have in the Chinese market. So we participate in that, but we're very cognizant of how our brand is being introduced and developed. And we take important steps to ensure that we have a very premium positioning for the brand. We see Tmall continuing to be an important part of the overall digital business mix for us. We see our own .cn site and our WeChat site emerging and taking a larger proportion of our digital business in time. We're making investments now to make that possible, and we'll share those details with you as they develop. But the launch of the .cn site or the relaunch, I should say, of the .cn site that we mentioned in the first quarter is an important part of that. And generally, just the expansion of the store footprint will drive brand awareness. We're seeing great traction broadly across China and a lot of signals that are suggesting that our brand is gaining traction. So that will support and fuel traffic in our business across all channels. So I think those are the things I'd point to in terms of just how we're thinking about the digital part of our business there. Irwin Boruchow : Can you just elaborate on the margin structure of the .cn versus Tmall over time opportunity? Stuart Haselden : Yes. For sure. Overall, there is an advantage of -- from a digital versus stores that is directionally consistent with what we see in North America in terms of the bottom line contribution margin for the digital business versus stores. That said, there is incremental costs that we incur to operate on the Tmall platform, but it's still an attractive contribution margin that is still higher than what we see in our store business. Operator : The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons of RBC Capital Markets. Kate Fitzsimons : Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess my question would be the 2019 outlook on gross margin. Just how should we factor in some of these nonmerchandise items? PJ, you did mention the 20, 30 basis points headwind from flying in goods ahead of the port congestion. But can we think about some of these other merchandise items are items such as rent, occupancy and the product and supply chain costs as well? Patrick Guido : Yes. Kate, this is PJ. So what's driving gross margin going forward, so the biggest driver does remain lower product costs. We did have a pickup in markdown and mix. We do see remaining opportunities in scale segmenting the supply chain, greater efficiency across the distribution network. That said, so there are some pressures, and those pressures are related to DC investments. So we opened Toronto. There were some startup costs there. Our collocated and our international stores carry higher rent, so we'll see a little bit of pressure from -- on occupancy and depreciation. But that, for the quarter, was relatively minimal. And then going forward, we're going to continue to develop product, right, so new categories, bras, outerwear. So we are spending money to continue to build out our product assortment. So again, net-net, we'll see modest expansion, as we've guided to, but there will be a little bit of pressure from those items I just mentioned. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations. Great quarter. Calvin, I was wondering if you can give us an update on the Robert Geller and lab collection. And any learnings thus far for your go-forward strategy? And then, PJ, just to clarify, the comments you made on the tariffs, were those the increase from 10% to 25% on List 3? Or is this predicated on the List 4? And can you give us the amount of sourcing directly out of China at this point? Calvin McDonald : Great. I'll kick off and just comment on both Robert Geller and lab. On Robert Geller, we're very pleased with the results of the collaboration. And similar to many of the collaborations we've done, our guests are responding very favorably in general to this newness and an opportunity to either buy into a new category or a unique aesthetic. With Robert Geller, in particular, some of the key learnings was this one showed up very strong from an international perspective, in particular, in our Asia Pacific markets, which is really exciting when we think of the opportunity for these collabs going forward. The marketing buzz through social was significant behind this collaboration, which is exciting as we look for ways to continue to leverage our marketing and create an impact and acquire new guests and raise the awareness of the brand, which then leads to the final learning, which is it responded very well with recruiting new guests into the brand, but equally, our current guests were heavily engaged in the product, which is a great opportunity for us as we look for ways to continue to broaden and increase the share of wallet with our highly loyal and high spenders. So overall, the collaboration performed very well with a lot of key learnings.  In the lab, those ideas will feed into our lab, of which we shared earlier. We're planning some shop-in-shops in the fall, and we'll continue to expand rollout from there. Patrick Guido : And then on the second question about tariffs, I'll point out just a few things. So first, I think it's important to mention that our direct exposure to China is relatively small with 6% of our total finished goods exported for China to the U.S. and [indiscernible] for tariffs. To answer your question, so currently, under the tranche 3 tariffs, only 1% of our finished goods are subject to that. The balance, the additional 5%, would be subject -- that would be part of the tranche 4 tariffs. So that's the direct impact. The better part of the expense is really coming from this indirect exposure we have. We're anticipating port congestion right around the timeframe, starting in that mid- to late July timeframe. And we think it's prudent and important to deliver new product for our guests and protect the sales associated with those goods. So really, the larger airfreight that I mentioned. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Curious, as you open stores in some of your less mature markets, if you're seeing a lift to your e-com business in that market? And if there's any way for you to quantify that. And then second, what percent of your product sales come from new SKUs? And what was that number in 1Q if you do try to quantify it that way? And I'm curious about what is your philosophy about what that percentage should be over time coming from new SKUs versus existing winners. Stuart Haselden : Paul, it's Stuart. I'll speak to your first question on our less developed markets. What we see in our international regions is consistent with our experience in North America in that as we open new stores, we see our web business, our e-com business, accelerate in and around the trade area where we open those stores. The -- and we -- but we also use our digital business, our e-com business, as a guide to understand where we might open, look to open new stores, where our demand and brand awareness is gaining traction. That is an indicator that factors into how we rate markets and trade areas as potential candidates for new stores. So that experience has proven consistent in our international markets. And we really see a positive, synergistic effect of the footprint, the growing footprint of the store, the store fleet in driving awareness in traffic across both channels. Calvin McDonald : And Paul, relative to the second part of your question, the majority of our sales growth is coming from our core products, our core franchises, that we either continue to innovate on or introduce new color pallets, which the guests are responding very favorably to. We do introduce a number of drops on a weekly basis. The guest responds very well to those. We monitor but don't share sort of the makeup as a percentage of sales. But overall, core is driving our business. We take franchises and innovate behind them, and I think we shared Metal Vent that's coming in Q3, tail end of Q2, which is a wonderful innovation on a very powerful, strong franchise. That will continue to drive. And as we test and learn into new categories, as we expand into yoga, train and run and OTC, which are the areas that we mentioned, our focus areas for the merchants and our product team to design into, the growth is coming from core. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad who's with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask about the most recent round of the loyalty launch, what you're learning from that, and I think it's in the third iteration. When do you expect to roll it out more broadly? How are -- what kind of data are you accruing from the program at the local market level? And it's pretty incredible to me the results you're putting up without even really having that data -- customer-level data behind some of the decision making. So intrigued to hear more how big of a lever that can be. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Omar. We did roll out. So we're now testing in Edmonton, in Denver and Austin. And each market, we tweak the program slightly from the product that we make available to the guests to the price point. As you know, we raised the price point in our later tests to see how the guests would respond. We're playing with the events, which are the primary benefit from joining into the membership. And in each market, the results have been well above our expectations going in, very favorable from the guests. And we continue to tweak and learn and do plan to roll into more markets, and we'll have more to announce at a later point in time. But 2020 is a year in which we see expanding into more markets. And we are very excited about the potential of this membership and the platform to drive new guest acquisition, which is what we're seeing with the program, which is super exciting; driving guest loyalty and engagement into the brand, which is what we expected; but also, on the back of having to be a revenue stream for the business in a way in which we can achieve and drive that engagement through that system. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan who's with Cowen. John Kernan : I wanted to go back to the buy online, pick up in-store. I think it's scaling from 35 to 150 stores. And it's a full rollout, I think, you said, by the end of the third quarter. What are your learnings from this? And how much of a incremental driver of demand do you think this can be? Calvin McDonald : I think -- so you're right. We rolled up to 150 stores, and our plan is to have all stores up and running by end of Q3, which will put us in great standing for the holiday. And I think we'll learn a lot when that happens. As we're rolling out, we're happy with the results. Equally, internally, operationally, 80% of the orders that are placed are ready for pickup within 1 hour, which I think is an important internal metric for us because it just sort of talks to the operational readiness and engagement so that as the demand from the guests accelerates, we're ready to be there to service them. As we roll out to more stores, we're able to position it differently within the website experience and the checkout, making it a lot more known and really start to market it. So early indication is encouraging. We think it's a necessity in leveraging our omni strategy, which is one of our pillars of growth. So we know we need to do it. And I think this fourth quarter, when we're in full rollout and we're marketing it aggressively on our website and in the checkout, that guests really know it's an option across the full fleet, we'll really learn. But I'm encouraged by it, and I think it'll be a wonderful way to continue to drive our traffic into the store, drive that incremental pickup and contribute to the top line. John Kernan : Got it. And then just on that topic. Obviously, the Lincoln Park store opening in Chicago, is this a test? Or is this like larger-scale, experiential-type store, something you think that you're considering scaling even greater? Calvin McDonald : Well, it's definitely a test. We -- as you know, our vision is to be an experiential brand. And we know we can deliver those experiences both within the store and outside of the store, and we do that very effectively across the fleet today. What Lincoln Park will allow us to do is to bring a lot of those experiences inside the 4 walls into the community on a consistent basis. So it is a test, and we will learn from that and then figure out how, within our flexible fleet that we have today from seasonal stores to small up to our large format, this, we believe, could become just another mix within our portfolio of how we go into a market and deliver our experience to our guests. But it's a test. We're going to learn, and we'll go from there. Operator : The next question comes from Camilo Lyon who's with Canaccord Genuity. Camilo Lyon : Really good job here. Calvin, I think in your comments about the strength of the women's business, you talked about the bottoms category continuing to be a leading category for you. But what was interesting to us was the mention and callout of joggers. Can you talk about how your female consumer is expanding their aperture with respect to your offering such that you're gaining a larger share of closet? It seems like that is starting to manifest in a way that could serve you well from the perspective of creating a bigger moat around the customer that you've invested in all these years. Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, for sure. What I would tell you in terms of the [Audio Gap] of our business, both across men's and women's, but I'll speak specifically to women's, is the number of new guests we're seeing as well as our reactivated guests in addition to a current active guest. So bottoms continues to be the #1 driver of new guest acquisition, and both leggings and joggers are performing incredibly well at achieving that, as well as we dial up our digital marketing initiatives and our e-mail campaigns. We're proving that many of those tactics are proving very effective to reactivate guests into the brand. And then as you've mentioned, to grow that share of wallet, which is equally something that we're focused on and exciting.  So bottoms really is a very balanced growth across those 3 pillars. When we look to building out our core and filling in the assortment opportunities we have around yoga, train and run as well as OTC, we expect that much of that will drive the share of wallet with our existing guests because what we're doing is truly bringing incremental assortment and choice to her and him, but in this case, to her in the categories in which she sweats today where we don't have product offering, but we know we have an opportunity to deliver it through our unique lens of science of feel.  So moving forward, we expect to continue to grow that share of wallet and, as you mentioned, depth of wardrobe and see a lot of opportunity to do that by just expanding into the sweat categories we already have a relationship for or with her today. Camilo Lyon : Great. And my follow-up question relates to the differences between your existing guests' purchasing behavior and the new guests that you're bringing into the store and into the brand. So is there any color you could provide in terms of this -- the average spend between those 2 cohorts? I think that would be helpful in determining what the opportunity is of taking that new guest up that spend curve and have that person or that guest look like a more mature, higher spending consumer over X amount of time or months or what have you. Calvin McDonald : Yes. We don't share sort of the average spend across our different guests. What I can tell you is, directionally, that our e-mail file growth continues to be very strong as well as our new guest acquisition. And as we're building our CRM capability, our ability to then migrate or trade up those guests into new categories or deeper into the categories they're in is proving to be a very effective way in which we're keeping the guests very engaged and active as well as increasing their share of wallet but equally focused on our high-value guests, which we have incredible loyalty retention numbers within retail. So they're highly engaged. The retention numbers are very high. And getting them to continue to engage in the category and drive growth is proving very [Audio Gap] was a big area of focus for us and something that we're really excited about as we look to yoga, train, run and OTC as categories where we can expand the assortment with that engagement and retention to be able to increase the share of wallet. That whole CRM initiative is a big area, and we're seeing some really good success from it. Operator : The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger who's with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : PJ, I wanted to just follow up on the potential port congestion. I'm wondering what you're hearing from your production department around the risk of port congestion. Is it that ocean cargo capacity is tight right now? Or are there other signals that your production department is seeing that suggests we could see this port congestion either late second quarter, early third quarter? And with regard to your deliveries in particular, it sounds like you've protected all of your deliveries from these potential delays, but I just want to confirm that you don't have any inventory on order that would be at risk of late delivery. And then I wasn't sure if I missed it, but did you offer any color or guidance on the second quarter SG&A? Patrick Guido : Yes. Thanks, Kimberly. So I'll take those one at a time. So with regards to the airfreight, you're exactly right. We are protecting our fall deliveries, and that's why we're doing it. It's a hedge. So we're eliminating the risk. I mean there's always summers, but we're eliminating most of it by utilizing airfreight and not getting caught up in the congestion, which is we've seen this before due to tariffs, companies trying to get out ahead of it. But there is also a broader issue with carriers consolidating cargo. They refer to it as transshipments. But that's a separate issue that's related more to carriers. But that is an issue we're dealing with as well. So hopefully, that answers your question on port congestion. On SG&A, so we are committed to modest SG&A leverage for the year. We remain focused on that. As we mentioned before, we're using strong performance to invest in current and long-term growth, and we're seeing a result from that. During this quarter, we leaned into digital marketing focused on building brand awareness, driving new guest acquisition. As Calvin talked about, we're expanding our testing of new growth vehicles, loyalty, Selfcare focus. And then we continue to invest in our North American online guest experience and data and analytics to drive conversion.  So the last few quarters have seen -- we've ramped up our investment. We'll start to see the benefit of those in the back half. And for Q2, we're calling for flat on SG&A. And we see the bigger opportunities in our biggest quarters, Q3, Q4, to add leverage to SG&A. But for now, we're still making investments, and we still feel like that's the right strategy for the business. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Nagel who's with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : [indiscernible] on another very nice quarter. I want to dive a little [indiscernible]. If you look at the gross margin trajectory here in Q1, clearly, still very solidly positive year-on-year. But the rate of year-on-year increase has moderated a bit over the past few quarters or so. So my question there is if we can understand better, what's occurred to sort of facilitate that more modest rate or more modest pace of gross margin expansion? How should we think about that line going forward? Stuart Haselden : So Brian, it's Stuart. Let me speak to that in terms of the drivers within our supply chain that have delivered the improvement over the last few years and then I think more specifically to your question more recently. So we were able to build the programs that delivered the larger, more step function improvement in '16 and '17. And we've been able to take that forward into '18 and '19. And it's a part of our long-term guidance that PJ outlined at our Analyst Day to deliver modest gross margin improvement over the next few years. There's really 4 things that are driving that : scale, price breaks from volume increases; second thing is segmentation of our supply chain as we are able to drive more of our assortment into the lower-cost segments of our sourcing strategy; the third thing is transparency as we're able to drive greater degree of specific production standards and costing negotiations across a broader part of our assortment; and the fourth thing is the distribution efficiencies that PJ also mentioned. So those 4 things are the drivers of our gross margin improvement. They -- we are lapping some very significant improvements. They will naturally moderate into the future, but we still see significant opportunities over the next several years reflected in our guidance. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. I appreciate it. If I could slip maybe a quick follow-up in. Just with regard to sales, I think -- Calvin, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments, you made reference to some of the soft lines or apparel-type weakness out there. Clearly, that did not occur in the [indiscernible]. But the question I have is as you look closer to your business, whether it be geographically across the country or even month-to-month, week-to-week, did you see any signs at all behind these very, very strong numbers of some stress in that consumer within the category? Calvin McDonald : I think when we look at Q1, and as we've shared, the balance across our product categories, both men's and women's, both bottoms and tops, our brand activations, be it some of the tests with membership or the event activity that we were doing, being able to leverage our improved data analytics and digital marketing, I mean, our guest was responding. And as we've shared, store traffic of plus 8% and over 40% in e-commerce is a good, healthy metric of a highly engaged guest. And we did not as we don't typically see in our business significant swings week-to-week or season-to-season or holiday-to-holiday.  So I would -- through Q1, we were very pleased with the momentum consistent with traffic driving a big piece of that business in both new guests as well as existing guests and balanced across our product range. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on a terrific result. As you look at the comps, beyond the traffic, how are the other components of comp? And how did they compare to last quarter? What are you seeing? And is there any more color on the merchandise margin and the progress there? Patrick Guido : So Dana, it's PJ. So with regard to comp drivers, it is predominantly a traffic story. Again, traffic in store is up 8%; online, over 40%. North American conversion online had shown significant improvement due to our ongoing investment there, so we're seeing a result there. As far as AUR, UPT, they have effectively [Audio Gap] we had a relatively stable average order value or basket size. So it's predominantly a traffic story. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. I'll now turn the conference back over to Howard Tubin for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate the time, and we look forward to speaking with you in about 3 months when we report our second quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Howard. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to take you through our results, which reflect continued strength across all areas of the business.  Lululemon had another successful quarter as our teams across the world continue to build upon momentum in our business and execute on our Power of Three vision for growth. On today's call, I'll provide an overview of our quarter 2 results, including further details on some key initiatives within product innovation and our international business. Next, Celeste Burgoyne, our EVP of the Americas and Global Guest Innovation, will join us to discuss the success within the North American region, early learnings from our Lincoln Park experiential store, and the progress of our membership pilot. Then, PJ will provide a detailed financial review as well as our guidance outlook. To wrap up our call, I'll provide a few closing comments, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Looking at our second quarter results. Momentum in the business remains strong across product categories, channels and regions. We're now 2 quarters into our 5-year vision, and I'm pleased with the strong execution and passion across the business to continue to deliver on our growth priorities. In quarter 2, total revenue grew 22%. Constant dollar comps increased 17% on top of a 19% increase last year, and earnings per share increased 35%. I'm also proud to share how we are living into our vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people living the Sweatlife through Sweat, Grow and Connect. In July, we opened our first experiential store in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, and just a few weeks ago, we hosted our eighth annual SeaWheeze Half Marathon in Sunset Festival in Vancouver. These are both fantastic examples of how we are bringing innovation to guest engagement and connecting with our community both inside and outside the 4 walls of our store. You'll hear more specific details from Celeste shortly on these exciting initiatives. I will now update you on our Power of Three growth pillars : product innovation, omni guest experience and market expansion. I'll speak to product in international, and then Celeste will take you through the North America and omni guest experience.  As you'll recall, our 5-year vision details our path to grow our core business in the low double digits annually, while doubling our men's -- doubling our digital and quadrupling our international businesses between now and the end of 2023. Within our product innovation pillar, guest response to our merchandise offering was particularly strong across the board as we continue to leverage our key core franchises while always delivering new innovation through the science of feel.  In women's, comps grew 13% as bottoms remained strong, driven by both pants and shorts. Within the men's business, comps grew 27% with ongoing strength in both tops and bottoms. Like women's, the men's side also saw strength in shorts. Across both men's and women's, we continue to innovate to serve our guests across key activities, yoga, run, OTC and train. Within train this quarter, we launched our latest collaboration, Stronger As One with Barry's. This dual-gender collection was designed specifically for the type of workouts that are popular in Barry's Bootcamp sweat classes, with fabrics that offer abrasion resistance, breathability and moisture-wicking. The strong response to the collection provides a compelling proof point of the opportunities as we push further into the train category in future seasons.  Now I'll provide a quick update on Selfcare. We're thrilled with the initial guest response as performances exceeded our expectations, look for several new additions to the line between now and the end of the fiscal year. We're in the early phases of this pilot and see many opportunities to create product with our unique positioning of solving sweaty problems for athletes.  Looking ahead across all categories, I'm happy with our near-term product pipeline and the many innovations that our teams have in longer-term development. Through our unique approach to innovation, the science of feel, we've recently relaunched our Metal Vent collection. This builds upon our successful franchise by offering improved performance attributes, and we're supporting the launch with compelling storytelling to attract new and existing guests to this product line. Our outerwear continues to represent a meaningful opportunity for us, and we're excited to launch waterproof wool in the fall. This fabric innovation will offer guests the warmth and texture they expect from wool, while keeping them dry as they spend time outdoors. We'll also be expanding our lab product to 45 stores and online for fall. As we showcased for you at our Analyst Day, our lab product reflects our pinnacle aesthetic and appeals to a younger, more urban guest relative to our core.  Turning now to international. Let me share an update on the progress and success we're seeing in Europe. I spent several days with the team in London a few weeks ago, and we're continuing to see strong trends in this market now that we are more established in the region. In quarter 2, total revenue in Europe grew 35%. We're also pleased with the continued success of our global event strategy, and in June, we hosted our Annual Sweatlife Festival in London. This amazing event brings together guest educators, ambassadors and other members of the local community for a weekend of sweat classes, yoga, personal development and meditation. In August, we hosted Sweatlife Berlin for the second time, and I'm excited that we are bringing this event to Paris for the first time in early October. We're also pleased with the recent opening of our first mainline store in the Saint-Germain area of Paris and with the rollout of our local market e-commerce sites in France and Germany. Both sites went live during quarter 2, and we're happy with their performance to date. In our APAC region, the momentum continues to be driven by strength in both our store and online channels. Total revenue in APAC grew 33% in quarter 2 with particular strength in China, where we saw market growth of 68%. We opened 2 new locations in China and our fourth store in Singapore with our Marina Bay location. We're in the early stages of our growth potential and remain on track to open approximately 15 stores in China this year, almost doubling our store count when compared to the end of 2018. And we continue to see strength in our e-commerce business as guests engage with our brand across channels. In China, our e-commerce comps were over 70%, and our new local market sites in Korea and Japan are exceeding initial expectations.  I will now turn it over to Celeste to share an update on North America and omni guest experience. Celeste? Celeste Burgoyne : Thanks, Calvin. I'm thrilled to speak with you about the growth we're seeing across our stores and online channels, which reflect the strong connection we have with our guests. In Q2, revenue in North America increased 21% as our guests continue to respond well to our merchandise assortment, engaging store environment and unique brand activation. Traffic remains a key driver in North America as our strategies and investments continue to drive guests into stores and to our e-commerce sites. During the quarter, we opened one new store in the U.S., and will remain on track to open 15 to 20 stores this year in North America. In addition, we remain particularly excited with the results we're seeing from our collocated remodeled strategy, and we completed 8 projects in Q2.  Within our digital business, guest engagement continues to be strong, and we are focused on pushing forward with improvement to our sites and mobile apps. We are currently in the process of rolling out new search-and-browse functionality, which will further enhance and personalize the experience for guests visiting our e-commerce site. We are also enhancing our product detail page across our digital ecosystem, which will improve product storytelling and product education and further support conversion. And finally, we now have buy online, pick-up in-store capabilities in nearly all of our stores across North America, up from 150 stores at the end of Q1. So far, the favorable response from guests shows how much they appreciate the flexibly and efficiency of this service.  As Calvin mentioned, we are living into our vision and engaging with guests in compelling new ways both inside and outside of the store. Our Lincoln Park store is truly the physical manifestation of the heart and soul of lululemon, which is reflected in being active, cultivating mindfulness, and developing meaningful connections. At lululemon, we refer to these 3 tenets as the Sweatlife. We're really excited with Lincoln Park's performance since its opening in July as it provides our guests, educators and ambassadors a space to sweat, grow and connect together. All under one roof, the store offers dedicated studio space for sweat classes and meditation; locker room for showers; healthy food at our fuel bar; a community space created simply to foster connection; and of course, an elevated shopping experience. 45 of our local ambassadors call this store home, and they lead the 6 to 10 classes we offer every day. Currently, the stores are one-of-a-kind for us as we learn from the initial results. Looking forward, we're excited to share that we have 2 key store openings planned for November, one in Minneapolis and one in New York City. In Minneapolis, we'll be opening our second full experiential store in the Mall of America. This location will offer several of the features found in Lincoln Park, and we are excited about what this store can teach us as a high-volume mall-based location. In New York City, we'll complete the relocation of our large format, Fifth Avenue store near Rockefeller Center. While this store is only moving across the street, the new 23,000-square-foot location will offer an enhanced shopping experience for our guests with a better representation of the product assortment for both men and women. These 2 openings illustrate the agility of our store format as we meet the wants and needs of guests in each community where we open.  Let me shift gears now and update you on membership. Our program remains very much attached. However, we are happy with the engagement we're seeing from our members in the first 3 cities of Edmonton, Denver and Austin. As we expected, our loyal guests make up the majority of members so far, but we have a number of members who's signing up for the program with their first purchase with our brand. In addition, we are seeing men connect with us via the program with over 20% of our members being male in Austin. While we continue to test and learn, we won't get into the specific economics of the program yet, but we recently launched in our fourth test market of Chicago. With the opening of Lincoln Park, we're excited to see the potential synergies that our membership program and experiential store can create together. Looking at our community activations in Q2. I'd like to highlight several for you that help us further engage with our guests who choose running as their preferred way to sweat. We hosted our 10K runs in Toronto and Edmonton with positive response from the local community and had 10,000 and 7,000 participants, respectively. In addition, we announced our first large-scale run event in the U.S., a 10K in San Diego that will happen in November and sold out in 3 days. Our brand momentum continued into the third quarter with our SeaWheeze Half Marathon. In addition to the race, which had 10,000 participants, including 3 of our global run ambassadors, we also had 6,500 guests join us for yoga. We offered Vision & Goals sessions, and we held a celebration in the evening with world-class musical acts. SeaWheeze is a powerful example of how we create lasting ways to sweat, grow and connect with our community beyond what happens within our stores. Before turning it over to PJ, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to our educators and store teams as they continue to bring the lululemon brand to life every day for our guests. I'd also like to specifically thank the cross-functional teams that worked to open Lincoln Park. This was a considerable undertaking, and I really don't have the words to express my gratitude for everyone involved.  And now I'll pass it to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Celeste. Before I provide highlights on Q2 and our guidance outlook, I will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our investor site for additional details. For Q2, total net revenue rose 22% to $883 million, driven by continued strong execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered an 11% constant dollar comp store sales increase on top of a 10% increase in Q2 of last year. Square footage increased 17% versus last year, driven by the addition of 45 net new lululemon stores since Q2 of 2018. During the quarter, we opened 5 new stores and completed 8 optimizations, including the opening of our experiential store in Lincoln Park. In our digital channel, we posted a 31% constant dollar comp increase on top of a very strong 47% increase last year. For the quarter, e-com contributed approximately $218 million of top line or nearly 25% of total revenue.  Increased traffic in Q2 continues to drive comps, both in-store and online, with increases in the high single digits and over 30%, respectively. And I'd add that the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $8.4 million in the quarter. Gross profit for the second quarter was $485.8 million or 55% of net revenue compared to 54.8% of net revenue in Q2 2018. The gross profit rate in Q2 increased 20 basis points versus gross margin last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 90 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns. This comes despite the additional air freight expense we incurred as a hedge against potential port congestion related to China tariffs.  We remain pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of strong gains over the last several years. Product margin expansion was partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in product and supply chain costs, driven by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain, including our new Toronto DC and an increase in occupancy and depreciation expense of 20 basis points. We also saw 20 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were approximately $318 million or 36% of net revenue compared to 36.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. We're happy to have achieved leverage in our -- in line with our guidance in Q2, while at the same time continuing to use the strength in the business to build brand awareness and invest in initiatives that fuel current and long-term growth, including data and analytics, loyalty, self-care and men's. These ongoing investments contributed to deleverage of 70 basis points, which is more than offset by 90 basis points of leverage in store costs and foreign exchange. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $168 million or 19% of net revenue compared to 18.5% of net revenue in Q2 2018. Tax expense for the quarter was $45 million or 26.4% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% a year ago. The decrease in our effective tax rate relative to our guidance reflects the release of new regulations, which resulted in additional foreign tax credits for prior years. These deductions benefited EPS in Q2 by approximately $0.02. We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. Net income for the quarter was $125 million or $0.96 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.71 for the second quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures were approximately $67 million for the quarter compared to approximately $50 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and IT and supply chain investment. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $624 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 26% and was $494 million at the end of Q2. We repurchased approximately 9,600 shares this quarter at a cost of $1.6 million. Coming into 2019, our Board authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan, of which approximately $336 million of authorization remained at the end of Q2. We believe that repurchasing our shares is an efficient and effective way to return cash to shareholders, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase activity.  Turning now to our outlook. For Q3, we expect revenues to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low teens on a constant-dollar basis compared to the third quarter of 2018. This also assumes 22 new store openings in the quarter. We expect gross margin to be flat to up modestly versus Q3 of last year. Our guidance reflects the impact from new tariffs imposed on imports from China as well as additional air freight expense. For the full year, we continue to expect a $0.04 to $0.05 negative impact within gross margin related to the new tariffs and incremental air freight costs used as a hedge against possible port congestion. We incurred approximately $0.01 of this $0.04 to $0.05 in Q2 and expect the remaining $0.03 to $0.04 to impact Q3 and Q4 more evenly. We remain excited with the opportunities we see to drive further increases in product margins. As we laid out for you at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to execute on our strategies to further segment our supply chain and increase efficiencies within our distribution network. These initiatives, coupled with ongoing scale benefits as we continue to grow, give us confidence that our gross margin will continue to expand modestly on an annual basis through 2023. We expect SG&A rate in Q3 to leverage modestly as we balance investments for future growth with efficient management of our cost structure. We continue to expect modest leverage on the year.  Assuming a tax rate of 28% and approximately 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.92 versus EPS of $0.71 a year ago. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.84 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low teens on a constant-dollar basis. We expect to open approximately 45 to 50 company-operated stores in 2019. This includes approximately 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the mid- to high teens range. We expect gross margin for the year to expand modestly, primarily driven by continued product margin improvement. We expect SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly. We expect our fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.63 to $4.70. Our EPS guidance is based on 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This range takes into account approximately $0.04 to $0.05 of additional costs within gross margin related to the tariffs and airfreight that I mentioned earlier. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5% in 2019. We had assumed the Canadian dollar at $0.75 to the U.S. dollar for 2019 as well as Q3. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $285 million for the fiscal year 2019. The increase versus 2018 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, new store openings, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects. In closing, we're excited with the continued strength we're seeing in the business, and we remain optimistic about the fall season and beyond. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : I would like to thank PJ and Celeste for providing these insights in our business and performance. All of us within the company are proud of what we have achieved. As I travel around the world, I see guests responding to our product, our innovations and living the Sweatlife. Finally, I'd like to thank everyone at lululemon for their commitment and dedication in achieving these results. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Paul Trussell who's with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Congrats on another great quarter. My first question is just related to the margin outlook for the third quarter and second half overall. Maybe just talk a little bit more about the puts and takes to the flat to up modest gross margin outlook as well as help us think a little bit more about why just modest leverage when low teen comps in the second half as you leverage some of those strategic investments that you started making last year. Patrick Guido : Yes. Paul, it's PJ. Thanks for the question. So similar to Q2 going forward in back half for gross margin, it's a similar story. We expect continued gains in product margin, driven by lower product costs. We don't forecast into a mix benefit, but mix has been a benefit for the first part of the year, given the strength in our women's pants business. But product costs remain the big opportunity, and it comes through scale, through segmenting our supply chain, better cost visibility and certainly greater efficiency across our distribution networks. So we expect that to continue.  The takes, as you alluded to, we will see some occupancy and depreciation pressure as we continue to open stores internationally, which carry higher rents, as you know. But we also have some product development costs for newer categories such as bras, outerwear and accessories. So those are the puts and takes we see in the back half, but net-net, we still expect modest gross margin expansion for the year and going forward. Paul Trussell : And on SG&A? Patrick Guido : And on SG&A, so we committed to modest SG&A leverage. Last year, we delivered. We're committing to the same for this year and going forward. We continue to use strong performance to invest in current long-term growth. We are seeing the results from that. During Q2, we invested, specifically, we expanded testing in new growth vehicles, loyalty. We continued our investment in our North American online guest experience. We continue to expand our omni capabilities, both in North America and globally. And that will continue to roll forward in the second half of the year. If we don't do these investments, we could see higher SG&A leverage for the quarter and beyond, but we continue to believe this is the right strategy for the business. Paul Trussell : And lastly for me is one of the more impressive parts of this quarter was the brick-and-mortar comp growth. Maybe just speak a little bit more about what is leading to the traffic increases and improvement in conversion that you're seeing in-store. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Paul. On the momentum that we're seeing in the business, I really break it down into 3 key categories. The first is the athletics space in general is very healthy relative to other sectors in both apparel and retail in general. Second, our business has fewer highs and lows relative to other apparel brands. And we're less dependent on seasonal fluctuations, and we have a very healthy core business that is driving our success. And then, finally, and it, to me, is what the team is doing such a wonderful job at, and that's engineering that growth. And that's coming from : one, compelling product; two, brand activations; and three, our continual improvement in our data analytics and digital marketing, where we're testing and learning and developing those strengths within the business. So it's a combination of the health of the space and the success and momentum the team is doing in terms of engineering that growth. And we're seeing that across all international businesses, and we're seeing it within, not just in traffic, but as you alluded to, very healthy conversion numbers, which normally, you don't see those 2 run together. And that's the work that our store teams are doing on guest engagement, investing in the educator. And I also think it's a reflection of the data analytics, as I alluded to. Guests are coming in prepped with what their intent is, and we have educators engaged and ready to assist them, and all that work is paying off. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss who's with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. So Calvin, maybe on the gross margin. What do you see as the multi-year opportunity here? Or maybe a different way to put it, any structural feeling as we think about gross margin, considering digital's outpacing store revenues and just the overall control that you have over distribution? Calvin McDonald : I mean, I think I would -- in our 5-year guidance and our long-term plan that we shared on Analyst Day, it's the best guidance that you should use to model, and it's what we're building into. It's a combination of fine-tuning opportunities to improve cost of goods as we grow in scale and as we build those relationships with our vendor base. Second, obviously, we're mixing in new categories and making sure that we get that balance correctly. Third, we're mixing in new markets. And PJ alluded to different markets around the globe have a different cost structure as well as we're expanding our North American business, in building stores that are driving wonderful sales numbers and engaging with guests in offering them the full product. So that full balance across our 5-year plan, we're committed to. We're seeing great success in it. A lot of that innovation is what's driving our top line. And I think the result is we are going to see leverage in gross margin, but it will be more in line with how we've provided guidance over the next coming years. Matthew Boss : Great. And then, maybe just a follow-up on the expense front. So I guess, really, the question is best way to speak to the balance between in-store cost leverage versus ongoing brand investments. I'm trying to figure out, is 2Q a microcosm for the go-forward modest SG&A algorithm? And then just one follow-up would be on the comps. Have you seen any moderation, as you speak to the momentum, any moderation whatsoever in August? Or fair to say that the momentum has continued through strong? Patrick Guido : Well, to your second question, we're pleased with the momentum. Can't give too much color on comp, but we're pleased with where we are, and we continue to see strong traffic. So good news there. On your question about SG&A, I would not say it's a microcosm of the future, but I would say given our store performance, we did leverage channel SG&A to a higher degree this quarter, but we also did have higher investment. And again, we use the upside of good performance to set us up for growth in the coming year. So I would also say we'll start to see benefit, and we already are seeing benefit from our prior investments that we've made in prior quarters. Specifically, digital marketing investment has driven guest acquisition. The enhancements to our website, search, browse, checkout are driving conversion. And our investments in data and analytics are allowing for greater personalization and a closer relationship with our guests. So our prior investment is leveraging. And again, that is a model that's been working for us, and we'll continue to deploy that. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager who's with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Congrats on the continued momentum. It was nice to see the trend of lower markdowns continuing in the quarter. Was wondering if you could provide some color on the percent of your total sales that are coming from markdowns today. I think you most recently commented on some numbers for the holiday periods. Just curious how that's trending year-to-date? I was also wondering if you could touch on what's been happening with some of the ship-from-store capabilities and how that may be affecting the merch margin trends on the markdown front. Patrick Guido : Yes. We don't really give out the specific markdown number, as you said. So our markdown activity was lower and -- this quarter, and it did contribute to gross margin expansion. Yes. Mark Altschwager : Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up. I was hoping you could comment on some of the trends you're seeing in the bra category. Been a tremendous amount of innovation there and a bigger marketing focus. So curious what your key learnings are from the spring season. Calvin McDonald : Mark, yes, we remain very excited about the opportunity within the bra category. The product team continues to launch and develop product that will launch in the coming quarters and years as we see opportunity to innovate into whitespace within the category and add to our assortment. One of the new areas for this quarter that we activated was a bit of that brand activation and storytelling, and we saw the guest respond well to it. In Q1, we really started to invest and set up the stores, how we merchandise. Q2, as we continue to roll out a couple of incremental SKUs, we got into some of the storytelling. Lincoln Park is a test, but an expression of how we want to lean into the category and tell our unique, innovative story behind science of feel as well as present the athletic bra category to our guests in the different segments that we see as opportunity.  So it is very early for us in bra. This will be a multi-quarter, multi-year investment. We are testing and learning and moving along. But the good news is that we're very happy with the results, and we're equally excited about how we're learning as an organization and what's to come as we continue to make investments in this category. Operator : The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons who's with RBC Capital Markets. Kate Fitzsimons : Congratulations on the strong results. You've seen amazing strength in the bottoms business in recent quarters. Did you say how much women's bottoms were up in the second quarter? And I guess when you parse out that strength between more athletic offerings maybe versus more lifestyle offerings like office travel commute, how do you think about the strength there? Is it more broad based? We're just trying to get a sense as to what aspects of the customers' lifestyle you guys are really appealing to, and just how to think about the trajectory of that business into the back half. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Kate. On the bottoms business, as you know, it's a core category for us in both women's and men's. And in Q2, we saw both of those continue to perform very strong with double-digit comp performance. In fact, men's outperformed women's as we continued to see success in our men's initiative as one of the key Power of Three growth initiatives. Strength in women's was really driven by both long styles in shorts. We're fueling the strength in shorts by leveraging our core line in fashion free franchises into a shorter inseam bike short, which is resonating very well with the guest. And in men's, the ABC franchise continued to see great success with existing guests and as a very strong new guest acquisition item. And equally, seeing success in shorts with the short and the Pace Breaker in Surge. So a very good, healthy, balanced bottoms business across both pants, shorts, men's and women's. And we continue to have innovative plans that we'll be launching to continue to drive that momentum forward. And as I alluded before, the team is doing a wonderful job in leveraging the relationships and then broadening, if you like, the share of wardrobe outside of just the bottom business. And we're seeing a lot of success in that, and that's helping to drive success across many of the other categories. And we anticipate to continue to see success in doing that. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez who's with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk a little bit about your average ticket size in North America in-store versus online? Curious to how different the average ticket is there. And how does that compare to what you're seeing in both Europe and Asia, when you look at the stores versus online business? Patrick Guido : Yes. Paul, it's PJ. So average ticket has remained relatively stable and is pretty consistent across channel. And there are subtle differences regionally, but by and large, average ticket is fairly similar. Paul Lejuez : Got you. And then, can you maybe talk about the tops to bottoms ratio? Where you are in the men's business? Where are you in the women's business? And where do you hope to be longer term in each of the genders? Patrick Guido : Yes. So the men's business penetration has picked up given the higher growth rate. It's in the low -- was in the low 20s, approaching the mid-20s. So that trend will continue. But while the men's business is growing at a high rate, the women's business is growing pretty steadily as well. So I'm hard-pressed to put specific penetration numbers on it, given both businesses are growing together. So -- but men's has picked up. Paul Lejuez : PJ, I was talking more about the tops to bottoms ratio within men's and the same within women's, if you can speak to where you are today versus where you're going. Patrick Guido : Yes. Sorry, Paul. We don't really share -- we don't share that. But bottoms is predominantly -- the ratio of bottoms to tops is obviously much higher. Operator : The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger who's with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Great. I was hoping, Calvin, you could just talk about your business in Asia. It sounds like, even with the slight deceleration in some of the economies over there, your numbers have been absolutely fantastic. Is the -- I heard you talk about the strength in digital, but it sounds like the stores are equally good. So I'm just wondering if you can talk to us about -- if you've seen any sort of change in trend there. And perhaps, you're just so early growth stage that you can sort of -- you're outgrowing what appears to be a very slight slowdown there. And then PJ, can you just remind us what your current exposure to China sourcing is and how we should think about the leverage or not to tariffs, given the risk that we could see them move higher? Any quantification you can give us on that side would be helpful. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Kimberly. In terms of our APAC business in particular, I'll start off with our international business overall remained very, very strong in Q2 after a very strong quarter 1 and remains that leading into Q3. As you know, Stuart was put into the role working with both the existing leadership of Ken and Gareth to really continue to put the focus on that business. And early -- but we're seeing great success of the strength of that leadership team coming together, shared learnings and working with Celeste and her team to really bring key learnings across the globe and driving the business.  Within APAC, it's a balance across both stores as well as e-commerce, and that's what's so exciting. We opened up 8 stores in APAC in Q1, another one in Q2 and plan to continue a very aggressive back half. We opened the year with 15 in China. We plan to end the year 25 to 30 stores. So we're excited about the balance. Guests are responding to both the vision of the Sweatlife and the product. And yes, it's early for us in the -- in our growth journey, but I think it's the strength of the product and the community model that is resonating in that market. That's also helping to fuel our business through these quarters. So it's exciting to see. Patrick Guido : And Kimberly, this is PJ. To answer your question on China tariffs. So just as a reminder, our direct exposure to China is relatively small, with approximately 6% of our finished goods in scope for U.S. tariffs. That percentage is down considerably, given how we have diversified our vendor base. We've never had more flexibility than we do today in our supply chain. So going forward, we do not expect it to be a big impact to the business.  In terms of quantifying it, I'll just reiterate that we guided on the last call we expected a $0.04 to $0.05 impact in the back half year weighted towards Q3. We did incur $0.01 of that in Q2. We do see an additional $0.04 in the back half, but more equally weighted given the delay in the tariffs. But it's a situation. We constantly monitor it. We have airfreight in as a hedge to ensure that we deliver for our guests. But again, this is an issue that we feel is highly manageable for us. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow who's with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Calvin, one for you on loyalty. So you're expanding out to Chicago. I know you can't give us too much detail, but I guess my 2 quick questions would be could you name maybe the most interesting or exciting thing that you've learned thus far in the small test? And then if things continue to progress in the right direction to you, when's a reasonable timeline that this could actually go across the U.S. or across North America? And then a quick one for PJ. Just on the supply chain deleverage and on the gross margin. I know you have the new DC in Toronto, and I think that recently opened. How should we think about deleverage on supply chain in the back half? And when does that headwind maybe start to flatten out? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Ike. Two great questions. On the first, what's been, quite honestly, a lot of fun in the learnings from the test markets are there are a number of aspects of how the guest is interacting with the program that we're really excited to see. The 2 that come to mind that probably we didn't anticipate to be as strong in the test markets, and that are -- that is, one, the percentage of new guests to lululemon that we're first seeing through the membership program. And the second is the penetration of men's in the program. So we kind of went in expecting, in a pilot, in these contained markets, that it would definitely appeal to our high-value guest, which it has, but to see it be another acquisition to acquire new as well as an acquisition for men's was not something we initially had anticipated and has been really encouraging among many other aspects. As you mentioned, we launched in Chicago. We're excited to be in that market. And we're going to continue to test and learn and roll out. We're going to expand more in 2020, and then really hit our stride probably in '21. We'll share more as we confirm our rollout plans. But it's early, but very positive, and we are continuing and will continue to expand to more markets. And '20 will be bigger than '19 as will '21. Patrick Guido : And Ike, it's PJ. To answer your question about the supply chain and the gross margin impact. So yes, the startup in the Toronto DC has had an impact and has caused some modest deleverage. That's due to the fact that, yes, it's ramping up, and we're incurring some costs and some growing pains there. We expect, again, a modest impact associated with that as the facility scales, but it should -- we expect it to leverage thereafter. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan who's with Cowen. John Kernan : Let me add my congratulations. You provided some very helpful commentary and guidance on international profitability at the Investor Day. I'm just wondering, given the top line strength, how international profitability has trended relative to your expectations so far this year? And then I just have one quick follow-up on Europe. Patrick Guido : So with regards to international profitability, again, we're pleased with the progress we're making in all of our regions. We are profitable from an international standpoint. So last year, we did generate profit, and our China business is profitable, our Asia business is profitable. And our Europe business, which is still generating a modest loss, is quickly marching towards profitability. So we're on plan there, and we do expect to continue to scale and achieve profitability improvement in line with how we guided at Analyst Day. John Kernan : Got it. And then just on Europe. I think up 35% in the quarter. You talked about some brand activations like the Sweatlife Festival. Just any more comments on how Europe is scaling. Seems like you're more -- it seems like you're a little bit more excited about the region right now, and certainly, some of the growth backs that up. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, John. I was just with Gareth and team a few weeks ago. And I would say across the management team, we're quite excited about the success of our business in Europe and what the team is executing and how the guest is responding there. We've been longest in London, and we're seeing a real healthy business driven out of that. But at the same point, the other countries we've expanded to are resonating. In Q2, we launched sites in Germany and France, in local language. And the guests are responding well to that continued to open doors. We opened our first full line in Paris in August. And as PJ indicated, we are very close to the profitability mark. And the team is doing a wonderful job in recruiting guests, building that business. And it's going to be a region that plays a big part in our international expansion and the commitment and the goal around the power of 3 of how we're going to quadruple it. And we're seeing some of that success to date. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti who's with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Let me add my congrats on a great quarter. Just one, I guess, fairly specific question on the margin. With the brick-and-mortar comp up 10%, obviously, very strong by any compare. I guess I'm curious about the deleverage on the occupancy line. I know there's some lease accounting noise in there, and then you mentioned the international mix and probably some double rent during relocations.  But I'm curious if you could help us just look ahead a little bit on the underlying dynamics there. What is the underlying leverage point on that line as we think ahead to things like accounting rolling off next year? And then I have a follow-up. Patrick Guido : Yes. I think what we pointed out in the past is that occupancy is going to be a headwind going forward as we open new stores, particularly internationally. But we've also incurred cost associated with building out our distribution network. So going forward, there is a headwind there, but we expect to scale and leverage that over time as stores ramp up, as DCs ramp-up. The real story in the gross margin is that product margin has remained strong and will continue to be the driving force behind gross margin. But we do see occupancy and depreciation in the gross margin line as [indiscernible]. Michael Binetti : Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess with the comments on international and some of the color you gave around profitability, but at different markets. I think the longer-term plan, along with quadrupling the revenues there, was to go from, I think, pretty close to breakeven margins in total last year, slightly positive to, I think, 10% to 15% over 5 years. A big move, obviously, but I guess, would you help us think ahead a little bit on how you see the inflection in the overall margin for international? Maybe where it's coming, where you see the profitability contributing the most first? And then is the overarching strategy there similar to the corporate strategy where, look, we're going to spend back any upside on the top line to smooth it out? Or is it back half-weighted within the 5-year window, front half-weighted for any reason? Any kind of color you can help us think about because that seems like a big contributor here for the next few years. Patrick Guido : Yes. So the big driver will be the APAC region, and specifically, China. So as that business continues to ramp up, that will drive a lot of the profitability. Europe will be also a contributor. So I do think we're on track to achieve that profitability that you talked about. And as far as the business model, given the fact that our international businesses are fast-growing businesses, that means you'll -- we will continue to be investing in those businesses as we have outside, similar to what we've done in North America, given we've seen the results for that year. So hopefully that answers your question. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the results. As you think about inventory and inventory growth for the balance of the year, how are you thinking about inventory and air freight, given those expenses that are wrapped in there? And how do you expect air freight expenses to be moving forward? And then Calvin, given the loyalty program and given the events that you're having in the stores, are you seeing the translation of the events leading to loyalty members, new loyalty members? And how is new guest conversion compared to what it had been? Patrick Guido : Dana, it's PJ. So to answer your inventory question. So we feel really good about the inventory position, given our momentum. We did expedite some fall merchandise using air freight, and we'll continue to use air freight as a tool or a hedge if we start to see issues in the Southeast Asia region associated with the volatility around tariffs. But from a pure inventory standpoint, we are a low seasonal business, and our aged inventory is really low. So we feel really good about how our inventory is positioned, both at the end of the quarter and going forward. Calvin McDonald : Dana, I'll just add a few points to your second question. We continue to see very healthy metrics with our loyal or high-value guest in terms of retention and engagement in the brand. Equally, our new guest acquisition remains very strong quarter-to-quarter, and they're a big part of the conversion number that you're seeing and we're celebrating across both store and on e-commerce. And one of the areas of success is in the migration of this new guest into becoming a high-value, where a healthy portion of our growth is coming from that migration. So we're seeing very good, very healthy new guest acquisition numbers. The teams are doing a wonderful job in migrating them up through the percentage of their spend. And then our retention of our high-value guest is very high and very solid and remaining in a very strong, stable growing position. So in general, when I look at the metrics of our guests, they are healthy across all of those 3 very important levers, and we have many initiatives through both our digital and CRM continue to improve and strengthen. And the notion of events and our vision of the Sweatlife just reinforces those. It's either how we acquire new guests as I shared, through membership events is how we equally share and acquire guests through our 10K events in London -- sorry, in Toronto and in Edmonton and in San Diego. These are great acquisitions. And then they're migrating out. So very healthy across the board. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions on today's call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate the time, and we look forward to speaking with you in a few months when we report our third quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead, sir. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; Sun Choe, Chief Product Officer; and PJ Guido, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our Investors site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. We're proud of the continued momentum in our business and excited to share these results with you today. I'm consistently impressed by the strong performance of the brand and the ability of our teams to execute at a high level. On today's call, we'll provide an overview of the results within the framework of our power of 3 growth pillars : product innovation, omni guest experiences and market expansion. And I'm pleased to be joined on today's call by 2 members of our senior leadership team : Sun Choe, our Chief Product Officer; and PJ Guido, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Stuart Haselden for his contributions over the past 5 years. As we announced this week, Stuart will be leaving lululemon in early January to take on a leadership role at a company outside of the apparel industry. He has been instrumental in helping us build our capabilities within supply chain, finance and IT. And more recently, we have worked together on our long-term growth strategy for our international markets. We are grateful for Stuart's many contributions to lululemon, and we wish him the best in his next chapter. Moving forward, we have a number of experienced leaders ready to take on more responsibility. I'm pleased that Julie Averill, our Chief Technology Officer; and Ted Dagnese, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, have joined our senior leadership team and report to me. In terms of our international business, our regional leadership structure remains in place, and the teams will continue to execute against our growth plans as we identify the ideal leader with proven experience to serve as our new head of international. Let me now share some details about our third quarter results. We are pleased with the strength in the business with continued growth across product categories, channels and regions. Our results for the third quarter include total revenue growth of 23%, a constant dollar comp increase of 17% on top of an 18% increase last year and an earnings per share increase of 28% compared to adjusted earnings per share last year. I also want to mention how our momentum has extended into quarter 4 with record-setting days over the Thanksgiving weekend and into Cyber Monday as guests responded well to our range of product offerings. I was thrilled to be able to visit 6 of our stores in 4 cities over the holiday weekend, and I was very impressed to see how our strategies came to life. These results keep us firmly on track to deliver on our power of 3 growth plan as we discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. As you'll recall, our 5-year vision details our path to grow our core business in the low double digits annually while also doubling our men's, doubling our digital and quadrupling our international businesses by the end of 2023. Our organization is aligned behind these priorities, and we are focused on the key strategic pillars that will enable us to live into and deliver against these goals. Sun will take you through our product highlights shortly, but I'm thrilled by the considerable progress we made this quarter within our product innovation pillar. Guests responded well to our product offering, which we continue to refresh and diversify. Momentum continues in our pant category in both men's and women's comps outperforming the overall chain. In addition, we continue to expand the key categories of bras and outerwear, with comps and outerwear being particularly strong. And in men's, I'm proud that we increased our revenue 38% this quarter, which is the largest increase of the year. Let me shift gears now to our omni guest experience pillar. As you know, last quarter, we opened in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, and we couldn't be more pleased with the initial performance. This quarter, we launched our membership test in Chicago, and we're seeing a halo effect across the entire market. It is the combination of these offerings that creates a unique experiential expression into loyalty. We hit our membership goal within 1 month, and participation continues to include both new and existing guests. We've seen approximately 1/3 of our members take sweat classes offered in the store, with over 90% of them sweating with us for the first time. And for both medium- and high-value guests, we are providing an opportunity to engage with lululemon in new ways as we've seen frequency of visits for these guests increase significantly. Building upon these learnings, on November 20, just in time for Black Friday, we opened our second experiential store at Mall Of America. This location has been adapted to this mall-based environment into what's unique in this market, including a higher volume of tourists. We'll share more with you over the coming quarters, but we're pleased with the early performance of Mall Of America. We're confident that as we invest in the experiential elements of our brand, we can enhance our guest engagement across the market. Beyond the 4 walls of our stores, guests are eager to participate in the events we create. Along with our experiential stores and our membership tests, our events allow guests to engage with us in ways that deepen loyalty beyond a simple in-store transaction. Building upon the success of SeaWheeze in our annual 10k runs in Toronto and Edmonton, we sponsored our first race in the United States in San Diego last month, which sold out within 72 hours. I participated and loved being part of this experience with more than 5,000 runners. It's a powerful realization of our vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people living the Sweatlife through sweat, grow and connect. What stood out to me was the remarkable engagement of both our ambassadors and guests, a key component of how our goal to create an omni social community that fosters human connection. Our events and loyalty strategies extend beyond North America. And in October, we hosted our third European Sweatlife festival of the year in Paris. These festivals are a great expression of our brand, and we brought together over 1,000 attendees for a day of sweat classes, personal development and connection. Let me now speak to our digital channel. The investments we've been making continue to pay off with comps this quarter of 30%. That's on top of a 46% increase in the same quarter last year and growth of 25% 2 years ago. We enhanced our digital shopping experience in several ways during this quarter, including launching new product display pages both online and within our mobile app. These pages provide more detail about our products and educate our guests about the unique attributes each style offers. Improving our search platform, which makes search more relevant on an individualized basis and moves us forward with personalization; enhancing our overall website performance; and continuing to increase the breadth of our online assortment. Finally, I'd like to highlight our relatively new BOPUS capabilities. We were in nearly all of our North American stores for the entire quarter and are pleased with the results. Consistent with what we saw from our initial BOPUS-enabled stores, 80% of orders placed online are ready for guest pickup within 1 hour. In addition, approximately 20% of these guests are making an additional purchase when they come into the store to pick up their online order. We're excited with our guest engagement here and expect it only to grow in importance during the holiday season. I will now move on to highlight the success within our market expansion pillar. We had discussed how we see considerable growth remaining in our core market of North America. In this quarter, revenue increased 21% as traffic remains a key driver. Existing and new guests continue to connect with us across both our physical stores and digital channels. A variety of components of the business are leading to this success, including our engaging and agile store environments, distinct brand activations and compelling merchandise assortments. Our brick-and-mortar strategy continues to provide us with flexibility. Prior to Black Friday, we opened our largest store ever on Fifth Avenue in New York. The 23,000 square foot space is spread across 4 floors, including a men's floor, 2 levels of women's and a dedicated flex space where we will activate a number of exciting product stories, and currently we're showcasing our lab collection. It's a beautiful expression of our product, and we're pleased with the performance to date. Our mainline and colocated stores continue to perform well. And given the timing here, our seasonal store strategy comes into play in a meaningful way. These locations afford us the opportunity to engage with guests and communities where we don't have a year-round physical presence while also testing these markets for a potential permanent store in a very low cost and effective manner. Our existing guests in these markets respond well and appreciate the opportunity to connect with us directly and in person during the holiday season. But these stores also bring in new guests into the brand with approximately 30% of transactions in these stores coming from guests who are not previously known to us. In Q4, we will be operating just over 50 seasonal locations.  Turning now to our international results, which demonstrates how our brand and our vision appeal to guests across markets and geographies. Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our store count across Europe and Asia. The expanding base, coupled with our local e-commerce sites and brand activations, is increasing our guest awareness in each market and importantly our traffic. This is fueling our strong revenue momentum across our international markets, and we are all pleased by our 35% increase in quarter 3. In Europe this quarter, total revenue grew 29%. To build upon our brand momentum, we recently opened a new store in the Marais district of Paris. This is our second mainline store in Paris and leverages upon the success we've seen from our store in Saint-Germain, which opened earlier this year. In addition, just this past week, we entered Norway, a new market for us, with a store in Oslo. I'd now like to focus on China, where we continue to see considerable opportunities for further expansion. I was recently in market with the team, and we visited several cities in and around Shanghai. Not only did we see the continued momentum of our more established stores, but we saw the significant opportunities with Tier 2 cities such as Hangzhou, where we opened our first store located in Hangzhou Tower. We had our best opening date performance to date of any store in China, and it has performed well ever since. This speaks to the growing brand strength and awareness lululemon is realizing in this important country. We will double our store base in China this year, and we believe we are only scratching the surface of our potential within China and Asia overall. Our digital channel remains robust with China e-commerce business growing over 60% this quarter. We had a record-setting Singles Day in November, where we surpassed the entire volume of last year's event in just 69 minutes. While we leverage this event to move through markdowns in seasonal inventory, we still realized full-price sell-through in the strong double digits and also acquired over 30,000 new guests. I'd like to pause here and mention the situation in Hong Kong. We are monitoring events closely. And as other companies have reported, we have seen a minimal impact on our overall business. However, this has been offset by the continued strength across the APAC region. We're excited about the results across our international markets, and we know this is just the beginning for lululemon around the world. We'll continue to invest in these regions as we [ leap ] into our goal of quadrupling our revenue outside of North America by 2023. Let me now turn it over to Sun to share some highlights with you from our product innovation pillar. Sun? Sun Choe : Thanks, Calvin. I'm thrilled to be here today to speak with you about the exciting things we have going on within the product function at lululemon. Response to our assortment was strong across the board as we continue to grow our core, expand key categories, delight our guests with pinnacle product and deliver new innovation through the science of feel. As Calvin mentioned, we were pleased with guests' response to our offering over Thanksgiving weekend. Guests love the special edition manifesto print we offered in our Wunder Under tight, Energy bra and define jacket. We also introduced holiday-inspired fabrications in key franchises across men's and women's to drive full-price selling during a period that is highly promotional. Focusing now on Q3, women's comps grew in the mid-teens with particular strength in pants and outerwear. We further leveraged our science of feel innovation platform with the launch of the Mapped Out Tights, which offers our new SenseKnit technology. This technology engineered ventilation and compression and directs varying levels of support and breathability throughout the legging. We're excited with this new innovation and look forward to leveraging it across additional styles over the coming seasons. We're also pleased with the strength we continue to see in our big 3 proprietary fabrics developed through our science of feel lens : Nulu, Nulux and Everlux engineered for yoga, run and train, respectively. We brought units into our Nulux fabric through our suite of technique to address our guest cold weather run needs. This is incredibly successful and gives us more opportunity to offer solutions in thermal comfort. Shifting to men's, one of our key growth pillars, total revenue increased 38%. We saw strength across the board with outerwear, pants, second layers and underwear all standout. Performance in outerwear was particularly encouraging with comps up 100%. Let me now share highlights on some of our key category expansions, outerwear and bras. As I mentioned, our male guests responded exceptionally well to our outerwear offering during the quarter. We were also happy on the women's side. Our lighter weight transitional pieces, train, run, [ yoga ] and OTC styles are stronger early in the quarter, with our heavier weight styles accelerating towards the end of Q3. In bras, we continue to push further into high support. We entered this category with the Enlite Bra and launched the Run Times style in Q3. We continue to believe the opportunity in high support is meaningful for us, and you'll see us continue to build out this offering in 2020. I'd also like to highlight our Roksanda collection. This is a great example of how we use collaborations to acquire new guests and gain wallet share from existing guests. With this collection, we collaborated with London-based designer Roksanda Ilincic, who is known for her modern feminine silhouettes and her trademark color blocking. The collection spans 17 pieces and performed well for us in both North America and our international markets. Guests love Roksanda's take on our popular define jacket, and they responded well to the Infinity Coat. This coat can be worn 26 different ways and retail for $998. What's exciting here is that this is another proof point which tells us that when we bring newness and innovation into the assortment, price doesn't appear to be a limiting factor. Looking ahead, we are excited to solve for our guests' unmet needs through our continued focus on proprietary fabric innovations through our lens of science of feel. Thank you, and now I'll pass it on to PJ. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Sun. Before I provide highlights on Q3 and our guidance outlook, I will refer you to the financial supplement posted on our Investor site for additional details. For Q3, total net revenue rose 23% to $916.1 million, driven by continued strong execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered an 11% constant dollar comp stores sales increase on top of a 7% increase in Q3 of last year. Square footage increased 18% versus last year driven by the addition of 53 net new lululemon stores since Q3 2018. During the quarter, we opened 19 net new stores and completed 6 optimizations. In our digital channel, we posted a 30% constant dollar comp increase on top of a very strong 46% increase last year. For the quarter, e-com contributed approximately $247 million of top line or nearly 27% of total revenue. Increased traffic in Q3 continues to drive comps both in-store and online, with increases in the high single digits and over 30%, respectively. And I'd add that the impact of foreign exchange decreased revenues by $6.8 million in the quarter compared to Q3 last year. Gross profit for the third quarter was $505 million or 55.1% of net revenue compared to 54.4% of net revenue in Q3 2018. The gross profit rate in Q3 increased 70 basis points versus gross margin last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 120 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs, favorability in product mix and lower markdowns. We remain pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of the strong gains over the last several years. Occupancy and depreciation leveraged 10 basis points in the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in product and supply chain costs driven by additional investment in product development and supply chain. We also saw 20 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were approximately $329 million or 35.9% of net revenue compared to 36.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. We're happy to have achieved leverage in line with our guidance in Q3, while at the same time continuing to use the strength in the business to invest in initiatives that fuel current and long-term growth, including data analytics, loyalty, Selfcare and men's. Foreign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 30 basis points of deleverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $176 million or 19.2% of net revenue compared to 18.2% of net revenue in Q3 2018. Tax expense for the quarter was $51.8 million or 29.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.8% a year ago. The increase in our effective tax rate relative to our guidance relates to certain adjustments as a result of the recent filing of our fiscal year 2018 U.S. federal income tax return. This reduced EPS in Q3 by approximately $0.01 to $0.02. We now expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 28%. Net income for the quarter was $126 million or $0.96 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures were approximately $78 million for the quarter compared to approximately $73 million in the third quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations in IT and supply chain and investment.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $586 million in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory grew 26% and was $627 million at the end of Q3. We repurchased approximately 44,500 shares this quarter at a cost of just under $8 million. Coming into 2019, our Board authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan, of which approximately $328 million of authorization remained at the end of Q3.  Turning now to our outlook. For Q4, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.33 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the low double digits on a constant dollar basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. This also assumes 12 net new store openings in the quarter. We expect gross margin to be up modestly versus Q4 of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect a $0.04 to $0.05 negative impact within gross margin related to tariffs and incremental airfreight costs. We incurred approximately $0.01 of this, $0.04 to $0.05 in Q2, $0.01 in Q3 and expect the remaining $0.02 to $0.03 to impact Q4. We remain excited with the opportunities we see to drive further increases in product margin, and we continue to believe that our overall gross margin will expand modestly on an annual basis through 2023. We expect the SG&A rate in Q4 to leverage modestly as we balance investments for future growth with efficient management of our cost structure. Assuming a tax rate of 28.5% and approximately 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, we expect diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.13 versus adjusted EPS of $1.85 a year ago. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.895 billion to $3.91 billion. This is based on a comparable sales percentage increase in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis. We expect to open approximately 50 net company-operated stores in 2019. This includes approximately 30 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the high teens range. We expect gross margin for the year to expand modestly, primarily driven by continued product margin improvement. We expect SG&A for the full year to leverage modestly. We expect our fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.78. Our EPS guidance is based on 131 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This range takes into account approximately $0.04 to $0.05 of additional costs within gross margin related to the tariffs and airfreight that I mentioned earlier. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28% in 2019. We've assumed the Canadian dollar at $0.75 to the U.S. dollar for 2019 as well as Q4. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million for the fiscal year 2019. The increase versus 2018 reflects a ramp-up of our store renovation and relocation program, new store openings, technology investments and other general corporate infrastructure projects. In closing, we're excited with the continued strength we're seeing in the business, and we remain optimistic about Q4 and beyond. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, PJ and Sun, for providing these insights in our business and performance. Before we take your questions, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to our teams around the world. I believe that one of our greatest assets is the direct and authentic connection we have with our guests. This connection is created and nurtured by the educators in our stores, guest education centers and our teams and our distribution in store support centers. I'm constantly inspired by the passion of our teams around the world, and I want to thank each and every member of the lululemon organization, which drives the performance we're sharing with you today. Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Congrats on the really, really, really strong quarter. Just 2 quick ones. One, I guess PJ or Calvin, any chance you could give some color on the men's category? Curious how the men's comps were. And then maybe, Calvin, this is for you. The comp guide is -- I'm sorry to nitpick. It's a little slower than it was for last quarter. I'm just kind of curious. Maybe -- is there anything you can share about Black Friday or things you've seen quarter to date just to inform us a little bit on current trends in the business? Calvin McDonald : Absolutely. Thanks, Ike, for the questions. And I'll answer the second, sort of teeing up my sort of view of Q3 where I'll sort of touch on our men's business. Our men's business continues to be very strong. In fact, in the quarter, we saw an acceleration of the growth incoming, so we're very happy with how that continues to grow. And as I've mentioned before, we're just getting started on our product assortment as well as our activations to drive both awareness and consideration, where we see a significant amount of opportunity. In terms of the guidance we gave for Q4, I'll first start with a quick view of what the growth drivers were in Q3. And as we look at the power of 3, we're very pleased with the balance across all of those 3 strategic pillars under product innovation. As I mentioned, we saw an acceleration in our men's business and a very strong continuation of growth in our women's on our omni guest experience. Our digital performance continued at a very strong rate, and we saw an acceleration of our growth in our stores. And across market expansion, we saw an acceleration of our international business, and North America continued its very strong performance. So very, very happy with the balance of growth in Q3, and I'm super excited with the start of Q4. This momentum has extended into the quarter. We had record performance over the Thanksgiving weekend, and we're happy the way that the holiday season has begun. We've always given guidance that we believe is realistic and appropriate, and our guidance for the full year has always contemplated the comps in this range, and our view hasn't changed. Obviously, what I'd want to draw everyone's attention to is the majority of the quarter is still ahead. There are 6 fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which is a unique calendar shift and is reflected in our Q4 comp guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter. Calvin McDonald : Thanks. Matthew Boss : I guess maybe first on the gross margin. So 120 basis points of product margin expansion this quarter was your best 2-year stack in more than a year. So maybe, PJ, how best to think about fourth quarter product margins relative to the third quarter? And then, Calvin, after 800 basis points of improvement over the past 4 years, how best to rank the remaining drivers of product margin from here? Patrick Guido : Yes. Matt, it's PJ. So yes, project -- product margin was up 120 basis points. That drove the gross margin increase, and that's on continued lower product costs. We had a slight benefit from product mix. Lower markdowns drove roughly 20 basis points of that improvement. I'd say going forward, the opportunity still remains for us on the product margin side. We'll continue to expand through scale, segmenting the supply chain, better cost visibility, greater efficiency across the distribution network. So happy with Q3 and where gross margin shake out. We were able to leverage occupancy on higher volume. And at the same time, we continue to make investments in product development, bras, accessories, outerwear. So I mean the way to think about it in Q4, we're guiding to, again, modest gross margin expansion. That will be -- we continue to see the tailwind in product cost, but we're also going to continue to invest in product development to keep the top line fuel. So again, the guidance modest expansion tailwinds of product margin. If there's already headwinds, it's the additional investment we're making again to fuel top line. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just a follow-up on the expense side. What's the best way to weigh the puts and takes on the SG&A line in the fourth quarter? And just as importantly, any unique strategic investments that we should consider next year that would be outside of that plan for modest SG&A leverage at low teens revenue growth? Patrick Guido : Yes, sure. So the puts and takes in SG&A -- the puts -- this quarter and throughout the year, we're leveraging our overhead. So we're picking up leverage there. The -- we're picking up a benefit from channel mix. Regional mix is a little bit of a headwind or take. The key investments that we are making, we're expanding testing in new growth vehicles such as loyalty. We're going to continue to invest in our North American online guest experience, which has been driving conversion. We'll put incremental investment behind our power of 3, particularly our men's business. And we'll continue to invest in our omni platform. So that will continue into Q4 and probably beyond. Operator : Our next question is from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : Congrats on a great quarter and best of luck, Stuart. So I'm going to start with a short term-question, so apologize for that. But just -- there was a lot of noise this quarter about intense promotional activity. A lot of people believed that your promotions were higher year-over-year, and yet you said that you had lower markdowns. So I was wondering if you could -- maybe we can pick your brains in terms of why maybe people are getting the wrong read from their channel checks in terms of your promotional activity. Patrick Guido : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. So first, I would just reiterate that lower markdowns have been a tailwind all year and contributed to gross margin expansion in Q3. I would also call out that our inventory was in great shape at the end of the quarter and heading into Q4 with a good balance of core and seasonal products and very low age stock. So with that, with regards to markdown activity, I think it's important to know that our omni capabilities, such as shift from store and our RFID technology, allows us to pool the markdown product in stores, in outlets, in DCs on our website for full availability to the guests. So this, combined with a growing assortment, it does result in a breadth of styles on markdown online, but there's just not much depth for units behind. In fact, we have the ability to clear markdowns faster and at better sell-through rates by offering a digitally consolidated pool of inventory. So you can't really conclude that we're more promotional by scraping the website when in reality we're creating better value for the guests. While clearing what little markdown inventory, we have more efficiency. Matthew McClintock : That's very helpful. And Calvin, I was just wondering for international, now that you're looking for leadership there, what traits or expertise specifically are you looking for? There's been a lot of volatility in terms of international growth for a lot of brands over the year, maybe athletic less so. But it'd be interesting to see how you think about what you need there. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. Great question. And I'm excited about the potential. But I would start with reminding all of us that we have some very tenured, strong leaders in place that are running these regions : Gareth, who's been running our European and Middle East markets for the past 3 years; Ken, who's been running APAC, has been with us for 6 years, 4.5 in RoW; and Shenyang, who's been running our Mainland China market, has been with us 2 years. So very strong leadership, and they will continue to drive these businesses as they have. And I have huge respect and confidence in their ability. And this will give us an opportunity to bring in an executive that has an added experience in these markets, in particular in APAC where we can just build upon the talent and the strength we have, but build and bring a unique perspective that they've been in the market and can contribute to our continued growth story. So for me, we're going to make sure that we select -- we're in no rush. We're going to select the right executive talent that has in-market experience and add to the very strong bench that we have already that have been and will continue to drive the markets for us. Operator : Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Erinn Murphy : I guess my question is around the loyalty program. Now that you're in 4 cities, could you just talk a little bit more about what some of your biggest learnings have been? It sounds like you're bringing in an incremental customer. And then some of the things that you would maybe change as you think about rolling this out broader scale, and then maybe just update us on kind of the key hurdle rates, things that you need to see before that happens. Calvin McDonald : Absolutely. Thanks, Erinn, for the question. So as you know, we've extended the test into the Chicago market, which was our most recent in September, and that provided us with a unique learning opportunity in that it's a much larger market for us. Up to that point, we had been in Edmonton, Denver and Austin. In addition, we had our experiential store, so we could understand the connection with that strategy. And I would tell you the results equal to in the other markets proved to be very strong. We sold and hit our numbers within the first 4 weeks, and we continue to see very, very positive results across all metrics. And those are, one, the engagement of our high-value guests. The amount of new guests we're seeing through this program continues to be very strong. And we over-indexed on men relative to our share of sales of men within our business. So it's proving to be a great loyalty and engagement with our high-value loyal guests, but also an acquisition of new and building our men's guests in a very positive way. And what we learned in Chicago was just the connection to the experiential store and having the sweat studio in place just strengthens the engagement that the guests have. Overall, they -- the guest metrics across most levers have been very, very positive on this, and we are very encouraged. And as we look towards 2020, we are planning on a broader rollout for next year, and we'll share more of that in the coming months. But our intention is to take these learnings and develop the program and expand it into more cities next year. Erinn Murphy : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a second follow-up on some of the things we're seeing in the store with Selfcare. It seems like you guys have been adding a few third-party brands. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of the balance you're trying to strike between both of them, and just generally, kind of what the rollout strategy from here is to Selfcare? Sun Choe : Sure, Erinn. I'll take that question. Thanks. I'd say we're really excited about Selfcare as a category overall as we test into this. And for next year, we are planning to increase our store distribution. So currently, it's available in 50 stores and online. As far as third party, it is only offered on our U.S. e-com site. I mean it is a fairly limited selection. It's approximately 8 SKUs. And the intention there is to partner with brands that we feel offer our guests a more complete assortment in terms of solving sweaty solutions for athletes. Operator : Our next question is from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Samuel Poser : Many of the questions have been answered, but I mean when -- can you give us some more details on sort of how you planned the events over Thanksgiving weekend? Because it did look a little more promotional than it did a year ago, but it also seemed like it was very controlled. Can you give us some idea of sort of the thought and how that all came together and how you think about that on an annualized basis as well? Calvin McDonald : Yes, absolutely, Sam. I would tell you -- and I was in market, I had the opportunity to visit a number of our stores across cities, both what was exciting that week obviously with us opening up in Mall Of America, our second experiential store and our Fifth location in New York. And the -- there is no change to our execution. We did take opportunity to utilize markdowns that we have as a means to make those available to the guests. But interestingly over the weekend, although our markdown performed well, our core growth was greater than our growth in markdowns. So we continue -- even though we had a very strong weekend, as I mentioned earlier, record-setting, it was still driven by core, leveraging markdowns as an opportunity to clear through some inventory and really put our innovation front and center, which responded well and no change in strategy. And the guests responded in a very positive fashion to that strategy. Samuel Poser : And then we -- on the loyalty program, you said you're attracting more men -- or at least in Chicago, you had -- you attracted more men and so on. Can you give us some idea of -- I think that's a follow-up on Erinn's question. So more of what those lines in the sand are to where you have to surpass them, like could you give us some idea of some of the matrix of what you're looking for? Calvin McDonald : Yes. It fits -- if this notion of line in the sand is, is there a hurdle or number we need to hit before we decide to go or not go, I would tell you, there isn't a metric in the markets we've been in that hasn't exceeded our expectations in showing a high engagement with the guests. We're just being responsibly cautious as we tweak the program and our ability to make sure that we delight the guests. There are a lot of different types of membership loyalty programs out there, and the majority of them are very easy to operate and execute. And the reason I think the guest is responding so well to ours is it fits with who we are as a brand being experiential. They are joining a cohort of other guests and joining the community, which brings them both event experiences, access to product and access to the Sweatlife, which is very unique and different. And they're responding in a very favorable way, and we're very excited about it. And we just want to make sure that as we scale it, that knowing that we are offering a product to our high-value guests that we're delivering on the commitment and the expectation they have. So it really is us being cautious in scaling as we do, which is right and prudent on something that I think is so unique, special, that we're not -- we're not rushing. We have no need to rush, and the metrics are very positive. So there's no line in the sand in that regard. And our incentive plan next year is to broaden it. And we will move forward in, I think, a responsible fashion. But there's no line that would indicate a metric. They're all very, very positive and encouraging and exciting. Samuel Poser : And just one quick follow-up. I mean does that mean like part of this to really surprise and delight, as you put it, your guests? Is this really also then about training your own people to be able to then go and sort of spread the word as you roll to other cities? So now you have 4 cities where you could then bring people and to trade them to go out. When you had one, you were limited. Am I thinking about that sort of the right way? Because you did that with your showroom. You did that with your showrooms and trade people and trade customers. Is that a similar type of manner that you're rolling this out so your own folks need to be trained [ maintaining ] this as well? Calvin McDonald : Yes, there's an element to the role that the educators play. But in fact, one of the strengths to our brand is we have a long history of our educators being connected in the community. And that's one of the big sources of how we grow and build our ambassador base. So that's actually not a factor that would cause us to just go at a pace. It really is our decision and control. Big part of the membership program and the benefits is we like to host local sweat opportunities in the community with studio partners. And so there's an element of us wanting to make sure that we source the right that we are able to host these events and these parties, if you like, and then bring our cohorts together. And therefore, it's just a unique aspect of the program that we've been doing in the 4 cities. And we want to make sure that as we scale it, we're doing it in the right effective manner that's going to deliver the right experience for our guests. Operator : Our next question is from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Congrats on another great quarter. So Calvin, you talked a little bit about the new experiential stores both in Lincoln Park and the Mall Of America. Just wondered if you can expand upon it a little bit. How many -- how much of the square footage of lululemon do you think these types of stores can ultimately represent? I think the last -- on the previous call, you talked a little bit about it, but any new color and any learnings that you have on this would be helpful. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, John. Appreciate that. I think the -- there are really 3 key elements to the benefit of experiential stores that I'll touch on. And the first is they really are the pinnacle expression of our vision of the guests living the Sweatlife. Second is they create a positive impact across the market. There really is a halo impact. And third would be the brand strength. So if I take those each individually from living in and creating our vision, we know through the Lincoln Park and early indication on Mall Of America is that our high-value guest interacts and frequents these stores on a more frequent basis, that they spend more time, that they are both coming back to participate in the sweat activity and/or stay and hang with others at the fuel. And that's also translating into shopping as we're seeing very healthy conversion and growing of share of wallet as well as attracting and building new guests. So in terms of the general metrics, they're very positive, and we just purely look at it through the operational lens of what you'd want from the KPIs. Equally and the second being the positive impact within the market, in Chicago, and we're anticipating the same within Minneapolis, is that we do see the overall market lift, and that's a factor of the ambassador community. These are hubs for them where they are spending time in building out both their influence as well as how they influence lululemon and the Sweatlife community, and overall, just brand awareness and consideration in both online and physical. So we're very, very pleased with that. And third is the brand strength. So if you think of what I believe is truly our unique approach to this loyalty, if you like, it starts with our stores, be it colocated, our current base or in these pinnacle expressions, the experiential. Then you factor in our ambassador community. Then you layer in our membership. Then you layer in our events. It really is creating a layered halo that's impacting not just loyalty engagement, but our strength within these marketplaces. And these experiential stores are really helping to create a hub to drive that. And I'll reiterate what I said on Analyst Day, which is that experiential stores could represent approximately 10% of our store base in the future. We're excited about the early indication. We're equally excited about how our store base factors into that loyalty equation that I just shared with you with the multiple layers of connecting with ambassador membership and events. But experiential will play a key role in tier cities, and we're going to test and learn and see, but they are performing well out of the gate. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : I wanted to first ask about just the seasonal stores. As you've continued to invest in the CRM capabilities, curious how the strategy around those seasonal stores have evolved. Earlier, I believe you said 30% of transactions are from guests new to Lulu, which sounds like a big opportunity if you're able to capture and leverage that data. Calvin McDonald : Absolutely. Thanks for the question, Mark. So as you mentioned, the pop-up or the seasonal stores serve a variety of really interesting strategies for us. One, they allow us to go in, in a very low-cost manner to test either new real estate locations within a market and/or a new market altogether. So we've been using that for a number of years, and it's proven to be very effective where we can either determine the risk or no risk of cannibalization, the opportunity of concentration of multiple stores or to really test the opportunity of a new market. And in that, not only are we seeing current guests being able to shop and interact more with us, but it is proving to be a very, very cost-effective way to acquiring a new guest. And then either we turn that seasonal store into a permanent location and we continue to nurture that relationship, or in some cases, we may not sustain it throughout the year but continue to come back into the market at an ad hoc basis. But we do maintain the relationships with those guests and then try to transition them into becoming an omni guest where they would shop with us online. And mainly, we would capture that through our e-mail file growth. And obviously in seasonal, our educators know that one of the key metrics when we go in is e-mail capture. So although we monitor that across our network of stores, in particular in seasonal with it being such an important part of the strategy, that is one of those really important metrics that we work with our educators and our teams to make sure that we're capturing. Once we have it, depending upon the outcome of the location, we would determine to utilize that information relationship with the guests in a variety of ways. 2018, we operated 63. This year, we have 74. That's sort of the run rate we're seeing. I think about 1/3 transitioned to mainline stores, so that's sort of our going-in rate. So it's -- I think it's a really exciting strategy, and as alluded, our new guest acquisition and validation of markets. Mark Altschwager : And then, Calvin, several times in this call, you've spoken to the powerful impact of events. I was hoping you could just update us on your thoughts on scaling that event strategy. I know it's always been a piece of the community building. It sounds like it's going to be even bigger once loyalty rolls out. But I mean is this specific to loyalty? Or maybe just bigger picture, how are events going to be a bigger part of what lulu's doing? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Mark. I think the first thing is to recognize that one of the beauties of this brand is that we host a ton of events globally on an annual basis. Now the size of that event is very different from what a local store may do on a Sunday bringing in guests to the pinnacle event at SeaWheeze or what we're starting to do with our run events to the Sweatlife festival that are happening in Europe and events in Asia. So there has always been rooted in this brand and the community is hosting of events. The opportunity with membership is to build upon that. We know that the guests love the ability to connect with one another, the ability to connect with our educators and our ambassadors within a community either through sweat or through grow, which is another aspect of the Sweatlife. And membership just allows us to create even more events. We do see creating more of these pinnacle events, the 10k event in San Diego. I was down there for the weekend. It was so incredibly powerful. And when you're there and you visit the stores, and all 3 stores in city over the weekend had fantastic results, vibrant. The ambassadors who are in the community, 5,000 people running. I was surprised, pleasantly surprised with the number that are running in our gear. So we are attracting our guests that are really engaged in the essence of what we're creating around the brand, and it's so energetic and electric. Membership will have some unique events. They will have easy and quicker access to other events. And some of the local sweat studio classes that we host will be exclusive for them or they can bring a friend, too. So it's not going to be an exclusive, but there will be unique opportunities. But events is an area that we continue to see an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with the guests and drive that loyalty in a very unique way for this brand and in our community that we're really excited and energized about. Operator : Our last question is from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Kate Fitzsimons : I'll add my congratulations as well. Calvin, we read about the investment that you guys made in Mirror in the quarter. At the Analyst Day, you spoke to ways to garner greater share of that $3 trillion global wellness pie. Just curious to how you're evaluating lifestyle or experiential opportunities beyond the core lululemon apparel offering in the next 12 to 18 months. Certainly, we talked a lot about loyalty today and the experiential stores, but just any additional detail about what's getting you most excited from a white space perspective would be helpful there. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thank you. I'll first just mention on the small investment that we made into Mirror and why I'm excited about that and working with Brynn, the CEO of that business, who some of you may or may not know is actually -- is a legacy ambassador. She was an ambassador of lululemon a few years ago. I'm very interested in the space of in-home fitness and that experience. What Mirror provided, which is interesting for us, is the opportunity to learn how the guests are interacting with the content. That is very similar to a lot of how our guests are choosing to sweat, be it through high-impact meditation, yoga or other train activities in home. So it really is an opportunity for us to learn both the balance of how the hardware works and then potentially app and other opportunities down the road. So it's really a front row to work with a wonderful person, being Brynn, that we have a lot of strong relationship with and seek. And I do think when I look at membership and the opportunity that we have, there is in this area of content. What we know the guest is responding to is our curation of content in the physical sweat space, and that is really exciting. And experiential and events allow us to curate other physical opportunities for those cohorts to come together. But equally interesting is how we can provide content in a unique way in the digital space. We ran SeaWheeze. 10,000 runners participated. But 6,000 runners globally ran SeaWheeze virtually around the world. So there's this beautiful and very exciting balance between physical and virtual that we're interested in and exploring. And membership brings it to life both in the physical, and we are leaning in and learning and seeing white space opportunity around the digital/virtual opportunities in which how that content can equally translate into the membership program and beyond. So it's an interesting opportunity to learn in an area that I am excited about and we are paying attention to. Operator : This concludes time allocated for questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Howard Tubin : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Happy holidays, and we look forward to speaking to you in a few months when we report our fourth quarter results. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica inc. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and PJ Guido, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information which we have assessed, which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and in today's earnings press release. Press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lulemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the fourth quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. We're planning to end today's call in under an hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and it's good to speak with all of you for our fourth quarter earnings call. We are very pleased with the strong performance of lululemon, both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2019 as we delivered nearly $4 billion in revenue. We continue to grow our core businesses while we strategically expand around the world and acquire new guests. The underlying health of our business is strong, and we entered 2020 with strong momentum. As you know, circumstances have changed dramatically in quarter 1 given the spread of COVID-19. We're proud of the actions we've taken across our business to help protect our people and our guests as we navigate this situation. I'll begin my comments by discussing COVID-19 as it relates to our business and provide a brief overview of quarter 4 and 2019. PJ Guido, our Chief Financial Officer, will then take you through our financials and provide more details on our more recent performance. We'll then take your questions. We plan to keep the call shorter than normal and wrap up in under an hour. Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by COVID-19. The safety and well-being of our people and our guests in the affected regions remains our highest priority. The current situation is clearly dynamic. Broadly speaking, and similar to many of our peers, we are seeing virus-related impact on performance across our markets. In North America and Europe, our stores have been closed since March 16. Stores in New Zealand are closed at this time, while Australia is operating on reduced hours. In China, all of our stores, except our location in Wuhan, are open with most operating on regular schedules. Our stores also remain open in other Asian markets, except for Malaysia, where our 2 locations are currently closed. In addition, we are closely monitoring our supply chain and staying in constant contact with our vendors as they, too, navigate the situation. Given the rapidly changing nature of current events, we have decided not to provide financial guidance at this time. That said, the underlying health of our business is strong, which provides us with many levers to successfully manage through this period. These include : first, our strong balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash, no long-term debt and a $400 million untapped revolver. Second, our investments in key technologies, including RFID and strong partnerships with our vendors, will enable us to maximize inventory across our network while managing our overall levels. Third, the power of our product. Our assortment is less seasonal in nature as many of our core styles are relevant year-round and can be held for future use. Fourth, the flexibility of our multichannel business. Our e-commerce sites, mobile apps and omni-capabilities allows our guests to shop in multiple ways, which is complemented by our agile store formats. And fifth, the strength of the category in which we compete. At our core, we solve sweaty problems for athletes, and we do not believe the current situation will change the trend toward people wanting to live an active and healthy lifestyle. These are some of the reasons we're confident in our abilities to navigate the near term while working to realize the opportunities over the longer term. In addition, we have early learnings from China, which show us that our business will bounce back. We are not yet back to pre-closing volumes, but the business is getting stronger week by week. There is considerable work underway across the business to respond to the current situation, and I'd like to specifically update you on 2 of these work streams. The first is the support phase, and the second is how we will enable the recovery phase. I'll start with our support phase initiatives and how we are currently assisting our teams, our ambassadors and our guests. We will do our best to open our stores as soon as possible when the recovery begins and will approach this market-by-market based upon the latest information. I'm consistently inspired by the resilience of our people as they navigate the unknown and connect even more regularly than ever before. In terms of our guests, our e-commerce sites continue to operate around the world, so we can continue to fulfill their needs with our product. Similar to what we've done for our own people, we have been offering online sweat sessions for our guests with yoga, meditation, Pilates, dance and train classes. Our teams in North America and Europe have followed the lead of our people in China, where we've gained thousands of new followers on WeChat. On Instagram, during our first week of store closures and thanks to our increased content offerings, we saw nearly 170,000 guests join us for our live classes. It's inspiring to see the strength of our guests come together this way, and we'll continue to stay closely connected as we navigate what's ahead. And finally, our ambassadors remain top of mind as well. We are in constant contact, and they are continuing to help us engage with our local communities through these virtual sweat sessions. As many of our ambassadors are small business owners who have been forced to close their doors, we just launched the global Ambassador Relief Fund. This fund will assist our ambassadors who own studios in their local communities to sustain their businesses during these currently extraordinary times. Let me shift gears now and speak for a moment about how we are thinking about the recovery phase. We know the current situation will pass, and we remain focused on being ready to serve our guests and support our communities when the time is right. Our balance sheet allows us to look ahead and continue the plan for growth as we manage the business for day-to-day. In terms of inventory, we are managing our buys and looking at our assortment flow with a full year view. Our teams are now in the work to balance supply with the current reduction in demand we're experiencing. We're in constant communication with our vendors, and we have flexibility regarding our receipts for the second half of the year. Our key e-commerce DCs continue to function, we are practicing social distancing, monitoring the health and well-being of our people closely and taking precautions to maintain our operations. Over the last several years, we have made significant investments in our supply chain and distribution network, and I'm confident that we'll be able to further leverage these investments to help us navigate through the current situation. Shifting to expenditures, we are currently evaluating our expense structure, capital expenditures and store opening and remodel programs. We are acting now to ensure we can reaccelerate our growth drivers when we are ready. PJ will say more in a few minutes. In terms of products, our product pipeline remains full, and our white space and design teams have not stopped their work. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel development platform to bring new technical innovations to our guests. While we have paused on our events, such as 10K runs, through July 31, we are continuing to connect with our communities. We collected our best online content from our ambassadors on our new Community Carries On hub on our global website, creating one central place for our community to connect and access online fitness and health resources. This gives you a sense of the scope and breadth of our global response during both the support and recovery phases of our planning. Now let me share some details about our fourth quarter and full year results. We are pleased with the momentum we saw during the fourth quarter and throughout 2019. Our results for the fourth quarter include : total revenue growth of 20%, a constant dollar comp increase of 20% on top of a 17% increase last year and an earnings per share increase of 23% compared to adjusted earnings per share last year. Our quarter 4 results demonstrate that our guests responded incredibly well to our product this holiday. Growth across all categories, with comps in women's up 12%, men's comps up 39% and accessory comps up 24%. Strong comps across channels with 9% in stores and 41% in digital. And within our regions, North America was up 19%, international was up 25% and China was up 70%. For the full year 2019, we delivered total revenue growth of 21%, a constant dollar comp increase of 18% on top of an 18% increase in 2018, an operating margin of 22.3% and an earnings per share increase of 28%. As you'll recall, our 2023 vision is comprised of 3 pillars : product innovation, omni-guest experiences and expand markets. These are the right pillars for our business. We executed well against them in 2019, and we remain committed to our 2023 targets as laid out in our Power of Three growth plan. In summary, we're proud of how lululemon continued to deliver against our strategies and gain momentum in the quarter and full year of 2019. While this period in our lives is filled with uncertainty, at lululemon, we are certain about our future. We have the balance sheet, the connection to our community, the strength of our category and the right growth initiatives to sustain us while we keep investing well into our future. Although we do not know exactly when the current situation will pass, what we do know is that our stores will reopen. We know that initially, the business will be lower than it was pre-COVID-19. But we believe that each day and each week, it will keep building. We are planning for multiple scenarios, but in any one of these, we know that our brand is strong and has unique pillars of strength that will keep driving our momentum forward. I'll now ask PJ to provide further details about our quarter 4 performance and an update on current business. Patrick Guido : Thanks, Calvin. I will first provide details on our Q4 performance and although we are not providing quantitative guidance, I will offer some qualitative insight into the health of our business relative to the challenging environment in which we are operating. I will also discuss specifics on the strength of our balance sheet and our overall financial position. For Q4, total net revenue rose 20% to $1.4 billion, driven by continued strong execution across all parts of the business. In our store channel, we delivered a 9% constant dollar comp store sales increase on top of a 7% increase in Q4 of last year. Square footage increased 18% versus last year, driven by the addition of 51 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2018. During the quarter, we opened 12 net new stores and completed 5 optimizations. In our digital channel, we posted a 41% constant dollar comp increase on top of a 39% increase last year. For the quarter, e-comm contributed approximately $464 million at top line or 33% of total revenue. Increased traffic in Q4 continued to drive comps, both in-store and online, with increases in the high single digits and over 30%, respectively. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $811 million or 58% of net revenue compared to 57.3% of net revenue in Q4 2018. The gross profit rate in Q4 increased 70 basis points versus gross margin last year and was driven primarily by the following : an 80 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs and favorability in product mix. In the aggregate, occupancy, depreciation, product and supply chain costs had minimal impact in the quarter. Moving down the P&L. SG&A expenses were approximately $394 million or 28.2% of net revenue compared to 28.9% of net revenue for the same period last year. Foreign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 30 basis points of deleverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $416 million or 29.8% of net revenue compared to 28.4% of net revenue in Q4 2018. Tax expense for the quarter was $121 million or 28.8% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.9% a year ago. The increase in our effective tax rate compared to our adjusted effective tax rate last year relates primarily to a change in tax legislation in the fourth quarter of 2018, which reduced tax expense in that quarter. Net income for the quarter was $298 million or $2.28 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85 for the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million for the quarter compared to approximately $69 million in the fourth quarter last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and IT and supply chain investment. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and with $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 28% with $518.5 million at the end of Q4. We repurchased approximately 1,600 shares this quarter at a cost of just over $307,000. At the end of Q4, we had $327 million remaining on our current $500 million repurchase plan. Let me shift now to current events. As Calvin stated, our sales trend changed dramatically during the second week of March when the impact of COVID-19 accelerated. Due to the dynamic nature of this event, we are not able to provide accurate 2020 guidance at this time. All of our stores in Europe and North America have been closed since March 16, and our current plans call for these stores to remain closed until April 5. Our DCs are up and running with the exception of our facility in Sumner, Washington, which has been closed in line with temporary local restrictions. This DC does not fulfill a significant number of e-commerce orders, and the closure has not had a material impact on our business. The vast majority of our stores in China and most of Asia are currently operating and showing improved performance each week since reopening. Through the second week of March, our North American store comps remained strong and in line with Q4 trend, driven by consistent traffic and great execution by our store teams. In addition, our digital business has remained strong throughout driven by traffic and improving conversion that is a direct result of the investments we have made in our digital platform. The strength of our business early in Q1, both in-store and online, reinforces that our brand remains strong. That said, we did see a dramatic slowdown in our business in conjunction with our store closure, and we expect this to have a negative impact on Q1 comps, margins and EPS. One of our key advantages in the current environment is our liquidity position, which is extremely strong. We currently hold over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and have no long-term debt. We also have a $400 million revolving credit facility, which has 3 years left in maturity. In addition, this facility has an option to upsize by $200 million. We are also currently actively managing our expense structure, capital investment and store openings and renovations. We have modeled several different scenarios to gauge the COVID-related impact on our business and believe we have the flexibility and nimbleness to adapt and manage to each scenario accordingly. To mitigate the impact we are seeing, we are reducing nonessential operating expenses and reprioritizing our capital spend towards business-critical projects. Among several other expense reduction opportunities, we've curtailed business travel, slowed the pace of new hires, rationalized our marketing spend and are working with our landlords to defer a select group of our upcoming new store openings and remodel projects. In terms of inventory management, our merchant and supply chain teams are evaluating all upcoming deliveries through the lens of current and anticipated demand. We have flexibility with regard to our fall and winter 2020 receipts and, where appropriate, can push out or reduce our buy orders. We believe we are in a strong position given our high cash balance, strong cash flow, no long-term debt and access to additional sources of liquidity. In addition, we will further enhance our financial position by managing working capital, SG&A expense and capital expenditures. The strength of our balance sheet and flexibility of our operating model puts us in a position to address an unprecedented situation within the global economy. In addition, it will allow us the optionality to still prudently invest the future and live into our potential as a global brand. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, PJ. I want to express my confidence in the leadership team of lululemon and our brand's strong position, which will enable us to effectively navigate these unexpected times. Our hearts go out to everyone who is personally impacted by COVID-19. I'm continually impressed by how the teams of lululemon are leading through this time and who they are being for one another, for our guests and for our community. In closing, I want to thank our team members for the results they delivered for lululemon in 2019 and for their perseverance and commitment to our brand that I continue to see from them each and every day. Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Matthew McClintock with Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : I hope everyone's family is safe and healthy. Calvin, I guess, the first question for me would be, you made the statement, plan for growth while continuing to manage the day-to-day. And it's an interesting statement because it seems like a lot of companies right now are not planning for growth, and they're just trying to survive. So can you kind of give us some insight into your ability to plan for growth, continue to grow, when we get on the back end of this and maybe where your confidence comes from that you're going to return to that in a reasonable amount of time? Is that just your China experience, what you're seeing in China is what makes you feel that way? That's my first question. Calvin McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Matthew. I mean I'll tackle the first part and then, I think, share a little bit of the learnings from China. I believe the balance that we are striking is recognizing that lululemon is in a very healthy position. We had fantastic momentum coming in to the current situation. And there's nothing that I believe will fundamentally change our ability to regain that momentum. Once we reopen -- once the guests get some degree of normal-ness back into their life, how they will come back into our category and shop. We know and we've stated the balance sheet is healthy. That allows us to trade and think into the future. And we equally know that with the Power of Three and the vision that we're building towards is, if nothing else, even reinforced with the current opportunities or situation that we're facing around our community, around our omnichannel strategy, how we're thinking about leveraging the brand and with our guests. So we are taking short-term actions, as PJ alluded to, that are appropriate because there is a degree of uncertainty. And we have looked at our strategic initiatives, and we have delayed some of those, but there are some, we're investing in technology, investing in our omni-digital capability and investing into that vision of an omni-social community, that we continue to make. So we have reshuffled. We've rebalanced, but we believe even more so that the vision and the opportunity for lululemon is strong. And now is the time to not stop building for the future while recognizing we need to sort of pause on some in order to maintain others. In part, when we do look at China, I do think it will help inform how North America and Europe will come back trading. But I do think the scenarios are slightly different in that China had a quick 2-week closing period when the stores were then reopened. We've traded 5 weeks since reopening. We are in our sixth week. But the country was still under a level 1 security alert. So I think its pace of rebuilding back business is getting better every day, every week, but is building back. In North America and Europe, we're planning on a longer close period, which I think once we reopen, could accelerate the pace in which we see guests coming back into the stores. And obviously, from now to then, there are other factors in the economy that have equally changed or evolving. So we're continuing to monitor, run scenarios against both. But I do believe in our ability to strike that balance and continue to invest in the future in the vision, and we're doing that. Matthew McClintock : I appreciate that color, Calvin. It's important. And then my second question is just given your background and PJ's too, where you both worked in that retail or wholesale business model before, can you maybe talk to us about how your vertically integrated business model of lululemon potentially allows you to manage the inventory to appropriate demand quicker or faster or in a more appropriate manner than what you've seen in your historical experience? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks again on that. And we are absolutely in our support phase of initiatives managing our inventory. I do believe being vertically integrated gives us a ton of benefits. And there are other benefits that we equally have that are outside of just being vertically integrated. The benefit of being vertically integrated is that we own the relationship with our vendors, and we own the relationship right through to our guests and how we sell and how we choose to present the product and the quantities in which we've been buying allows us to manage very differently, in my opinion. Equally, and as we've commented before, one of the benefits around our inventory and product, we have bought through the first half of the year. We are able to influence our Q3 buy slightly, and we are in the work on our fall and winter buys now. But our product is less seasonal. There is a high percentage of our business that is core, which means we're able to hold and continue to sell for a much longer period of time. We're less dependent on the need to flush out inventory. Second, our technology. With the use of RFID, we can access product at any point across our network, not just DCs, but at our stores as well from ship from store. So it allows us to do just regular demand that we're seeing today. Online, our plan in the next week is to turn on ship from store from our stores, although they will not be open to the public, we will be opening up some locations from a ship from store perspective and have a small number of staff operating that. That's going to allow us to continue to manage that inventory that's already in the network very effectively. And so those, I think, combined with the relationships we have with our vendors and the fact that we own the end-to-end are a number of very unique levers that put us in a much better position to manage our inventory levels. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird & Co. Mark Altschwager : I wanted to ask about the product strategy and how you're thinking about that as we move through the crisis. Are you planning any changes to the flow of newness? Are there product launches that you're looking to delay until store operations have ramped back up? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Mark. We're seeing some shifts in demand. Currently, as you can imagine, much of that is more in the accessories categories with yoga mats and some of our yoga blocks and items that are fulfilling that need as more and more of our guests sweat at home. But we're not planning to change any of our launch cadence. Rather, we're looking at timing to ensure that our plans are still relevant with the environment that we're in to make sure that how we present the product to the guest is in appropriate way that it's not tone deaf to the situations that are happening around us. But in general, I think the benefit we have is that -- and what's in our favor is that our launches are rooted in solving guests' unmet needs, and it really isn't bound to time or seasonality or fashion. So there are real no changes to 2020 launch plans or as we look into '21 at this point in time. We had just launched our Everlux in February, which is our first product launch for this year under Science of Feel positioning, and the guests resonated incredibly strong to it. It was -- far exceeded our expectations and continues to sell well online. And as I look forward to the rest of the year, we don't have any immediate plans at this place. We have our online network to sell. We still have other markets where we're operating in. And we know, as I said, we will be open soon, and we believe the innovation and what we have will only enhance and entice the guests to come back into the stores. Mark Altschwager : And if I could just follow up on digital real quickly. Is it your hypothesis that the digital business will capture some incremental demand given the store closures? I know you said things have slowed recently here. And I was hoping you could clarify, are you saying that the growth has slowed from the rates of growth you were seeing in the fourth quarter? Or have you seen digital demand actually turned negative in recent weeks? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Mark, and definitely want to clarify that. We saw coming into the store closures very strong momentum in both our retail and digital channels. As PJ alluded to, we had an incredible fourth quarter. Total comps of 20%, which was the strongest in all of 2019, which was a very strong year for us. So it's great to end with that momentum. We saw that momentum continue into the start of this year across both physical stores and digital. Since closing, our digital business has picked up, but it's obviously not recovering all the volume loss from our store networks being closed, but we have seen our store -- or our online business accelerate in terms of growth. But obviously, it cannot pick up the entire demand. So it is responding well, and we've adjusted our digital marketing initiatives. We leaned in a bit there, again, back to the notion of balancing cost expenditures, but doing it strategic. We've leaned in a bit. We're seeing good response to that, good response to new products, still some other categories are picking up, but it's not completely covering the loss of store volume but is responding in a positive manner. Operator : Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo Securities. Irwin Boruchow : So I guess, maybe for Calvin, on China, you gave some helpful details on the progression in the build, which is really helpful for us to understand what's going on over there. Could you give maybe a little bit more color? I think you've said that ever since kind of reopening 5 or 6 weeks ago, you've seen gradual build, but your volumes aren't at pre-COVID levels. Can you talk about it maybe from a comp perspective? Like I assume comps are still negative year-over-year. Where exactly is that trending now? Is there a -- based on what you see, is there a target in mind or a date in mind when you think comps can start to grow again in China? I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Ike. As I sort of teed up, what's interesting with China and I think an important element to remember is that we closed for 2 weeks. We've been open for 5. We're in our sixth week. The country was still on a Level 1 emergency alert. They are just moving to a Level 2 this weekend in Shanghai, Beijing. In one of our other regions, that region moved to a Level 2 earlier in the week. And we did see an immediate uptick in the performance of the stores. Yesterday, our total business in China from a collective of stores and online had a very strong day. So it really is day-to-day, and we're learning as we go. I believe that the 5-week period was impacted by the Level 1 emergency alert. And as that changes, we will see more and more business come back at a quicker rate than what we have over the 5 weeks, and we're seeing that, although it is early. And we have been in negative comp but improving. And I think it's too early to assess when will we tip over negative comp into positive comp in our stores. Our online business has been trending very well, positive comps. But similar to North America, it just cannot offset the entire volume loss in our physical stores. But with what I'm seeing in the last few days and as these emergency alerts drop, I have reason to believe that we will see a quicker pace than we've seen in the last 5 weeks to that important sort of inflection point of getting back to positive. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the holiday and the momentum coming into the year. PJ, my question for you is on CapEx. It was about $280 million for fiscal '19. And the spread was about, what, $170 million for stores and about $100 million corporate. So as we're looking into 2020, I was wondering how should we think about store investment and continuing to grow. That piece of it seems like it's the growth aspect of it. And when we're thinking about CapEx reduction, is it $100 million off of this number? We were hearing people cut their CapEx up 50% to 60%. So just wondering if you can give us some color there. Patrick Guido : Yes. Sure, Adrienne. So first off, yes, our CapEx was closer to $300 million for 2019. And we're not giving guidance for 2020 because we are managing it actively. To answer your question, I would say roughly 1/3 of our CapEx is maintenance CapEx with the balance being growth. And as you said, it comes in the form of stores, and it also comes in the form of investing in growth platforms, our supply chain, our IT. So we are going to -- we are actively reviewing the CapEx budget and where we can throttle back on things that we don't see having a huge impact on the business, we'll do that. But we'll still absolutely do the things that we need for long-term growth. So we will pull back on CapEx. Hard to give you a specific number right now. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Fair enough. And Calvin, a really quick one for you. Did you say all the stores are open or 80% of them are open? And of the ones that are open, if you quintile them, is the top quintile within 10% of comping or within -- or is it pretty tight spread across the different buckets of them? Or are certain markets doing materially better than others? Calvin McDonald : Right. Just to confirm, you referencing 80% open, is that specific to China? Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Specific to China, yes. Calvin McDonald : Okay. All our stores are now open in China, except for one in Wuhan, which actually we just received notification that it will be opening next week. So we'll have all doors open next week in China, which I think is positive and continue sort of the positive trend that's happening in that marketplace with the COVID-19. And there are differences in terms of how stores are performing, and it is both by markets as well as when we've seen some of these level emergency alerts change. They aren't broadly distributed. So the difference between the top quartile to the bottom left quartile isn't a massive scatter, but we are seeing some stores that are closer to the positive comp than others. But they are all trending and moving sort of week-by-week into a similar trend, which is every market, every store is getting better. Some started closer to the positive comp and have continued the momentum to that. And then as these markets take -- or cities take a position to change their emergency status, that's where we really see the inflection point on overall performance improvement. Operator : Your next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Calvin, you talked about some of the efforts that the lulu community has done to just bring some of the virtual workout and meditations online as you connect with your consumer. I guess can you talk a little bit more about what you've seen specifically with new customer acquisition during this period, maybe looking at China first and then here in North America and Europe? And then second question really for PJ, regarding just the flexibility to manage expenses during this period of time since we don't kind of have adequate history going back to former recessionary period in your model. Calvin McDonald : In China, where we first innovated and continued sort of our relationship and partnership we had with an app there called Keep, which is a wonderful platform to activate sort of online sweat and then introduced some of the innovation around WeChat, I shared some numbers with you. And we are seeing a number of new guests. Whenever we do these type of activations in that market, be it some of our Tmall initiatives around Brand Day or on these type of platforms and partnerships, they're proving to be wonderful new guest acquisitions. So we're doing more of them as a result of not having physical sweat or events as an option, and we're seeing an increase in the acquisition of new guests. In North America, it's early, but I would anticipate that we would equally see some new guests acquired this way, but it is really absolutely satisfying and providing a service to our loyal guests that actively participate in our events that aren't available to them at this point in time or our ambassador studio community that are closed at this point in time. So I think we will see some but not quite to the degree of the China market, but it's a combination of. And I think it's just reinforcing the power of one of our goals as it relates to our vision, which is building this omni-social community where we launch and host both physical events and physical activations to come together, be it through membership or stores or local events as well as our digital. And this has just pushed our innovation into the digital space. And it's inspiring to see the guests respond to it and think how the physical and digital will come together as we lean into that as one of the opportunities for our vision. Patrick Guido : And then, Erinn, on your question about managing expenses. So we do have significant flexibility built into our SG&A. And the way we think about it is in a few buckets. There's the variable component, which will come down naturally as sales have come down. But there's also things we can do to drill into that a little bit further. There's the discretionary spend. Marketing is a good example. We can redeploy marketing dollars. For example, we're not doing store events now, but we can redeploy into digital marketing to drive e-comm performance. So we can do things there. And then there's the overhead piece, which we are actively managing. And I talked about it a little in the prepared remarks, but there are several levers we can pull to control expense, whether it's slowing head count growth, curtailing travel. There's a number of buckets across the organization where we can find savings depending on what scenario we are in. So I feel pretty good about the flex we have in the P&L. Operator : The next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons with RBC Capital Markets. Kate Fitzsimons : Yes. I guess, first, I just want to ask on the occupancy front. We've heard -- seen headlines just about rent renegotiations going on with landlord. I believe you guys had alluded to maybe deferring some of the rent on the newer projects. But just maybe give us an update on some of the active conversations you are having with landlords. And then secondly, just on the inventory, certainly understand there's a decent portion that is -- can be repurposed for later seasons, less fashion associated with it. But I guess when we're thinking about the aspects of the assortments that can't be reused in future seasons, just how are you thinking about getting rid of the excess? Should we think about warehouse sales, just -- write-downs? Just help us kind of contextualize it there, that would be helpful. Patrick Guido : Yes. Thanks, Kate. It's PJ. So on the occupancy piece, it's obviously a very fluid real-time situation. So it's hard to comment on any rent relief we might see. What I will say is we have great relationships with our landlords. We are in active conversations with them. So we're hoping for some flexibility and anticipate some. So there's more to come on that but nothing solidified at this point. Calvin McDonald : And on the different options relative to our inventory position. One, obviously, that we're activating because you want to get ahead of it is our forward buy, and that's the work we're in right now, as well as work with our vendors on orders that had been placed. And if we want to adjust those accordingly based on the inventory we have on hand, knowing that a large percentage of it is core. But some of those future orders would have been replacing core, and we can reduce and pull those down. And on that core inventory, when it's your basic colors, there is no need for us to take a short-term immediate action, and we won't. There will be a portion of inventory that we will want to look to our traditional levers in order to help us clear through. I think the important thing is we don't need to nor are there any plans on making any short-term decisions that's going to hurt our brand, our positioning -- our price positioning in the long term. We have had clearance strategies. And right now, we don't see any need to change from them. We're going to continue to use in-store as markdowns. Online as markdowns. We have outlets. And up to 2019, we've had online warehouse sales. And last year, we didn't need to run that, so we did not. But we have typically run warehouse sales, and that is one initiative that is at our disposal, and we may use it. But we have always traditionally used it. And combined with the other levers, I see no need to activate anything further, and everyone should know that we are managing all those decisions through the lens that we won't take anything that puts our price positioning, the power of our price and our brand at risk nor do we see the need to. Kate Fitzsimons : Great. And really, congratulations on the momentum in 2019. It was pretty spectacular. Calvin McDonald : Thank you. Patrick Guido : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for Q&A today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.",

As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon Athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's First quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; Sun Choe, Chief Product Officer; Meghan Frank, SVP, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Alex Grieve, VP and Controller. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but which by its nature, is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the quarter. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. It's good to speak with all of you again to provide an update on our first quarter, how we are adapting to and navigating the unique challenges presented by COVID-19 and the trends we're currently seeing in the business. I'm pleased to be joined today by Sun Choe, our Chief Product Officer, who will share some product highlights. You'll also hear from Meghan Frank, our SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis. Meghan is one of our seasoned veterans within the finance organization, who has stepped into an expanded leadership role while our CFO search is underway. I'm excited to be working closely with Meghan and appreciate the support she's providing to the organization. Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Alex Grieve, our VP and Controller. Given recent events, I'd like to begin by sharing some thoughts on the tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and far too many others and the global outrage over long-standing issues of racial injustice and systemic discrimination. Black lives matter. Lululemon unequivocally denounces the unacceptable racial violence and oppression that directly impacts the black community. We are listening and learning and taking action. As a company, we are committed to increasing our investment in education, behavior change and diverse representation within our organization, and calling on our global community to drive positive change into the future. I look forward to sharing more details and our progress on these commitments going forward. Let me turn now to our overall business performance in quarter 1. Total revenue decreased 17%. Due to the significant number of stores closed during the quarter, we are not reporting same-store sales. Our e-commerce business was particularly strong in quarter 1, accelerating as the quarter proceeded. E-commerce comps increased 70%, which is on top of 35% increase last year. This represented a meaningful acceleration relative to our quarter 4 e-commerce comps of 41%. Gross margin declined 260 basis points as deleverage on occupancy and other nonproduct costs offset an increase in product margin, and earnings per share were $0.22 versus $0.74 last year. And our financial position remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in total liquidity. I'd also like to provide some insights into our market share gains. While we typically do not share market share data under these circumstances, the data helps calibrate our performance and reinforces the strength of our brand. In the athletic apparel space, a category that is performing better than other apparel categories, we saw one of our largest quarterly gains in market share in recent years, according to NPD data. Given the challenges presented by COVID-19, our Q1 results unfolded in 3 phases, with each 1 exhibiting unique performance characteristics. We also had key learnings across the quarter.  Let me now speak to our business performance within each phase. During Phase 1, the pre-COVID time period, we were very pleased with the momentum lululemon carried into the quarter, building off of our strong quarter 4 performance, our business accelerated through early March with total comps increasing over 20%. We saw strength in all of our regions, except Asia, which was already experiencing the effects of the virus by this time. In mid-March, we entered Phase 2 as COVID-19 began to spread across the globe. We moved quickly to protect our people and guests by closing the majority of our stores. While guests in North America and Europe were just beginning to deal with COVID-19, guests in China were beginning to move into the recovery phase. Our total comps in China were positive in March, with strength in our e-commerce business offsetting continued declines in our stores. During this period, as our stores started closing globally, our e-commerce growth began to accelerate. In late March and April, we moved into the early recovery phase. A new normal emerged, and we were encouraged to see how quickly our guests were embracing both working and sweating from home. We saw a significant acceleration in sales trends that resulted in 125% e-commerce comp for the month of April, with this momentum continuing into the second quarter. During this phase, our overall business in China accelerated further as guests began to feel more comfortable returning to the stores. Our total comps in China increased in the low teens in April and have further improved into quarter 2. While this period of time remains uncharted territory, I'd like to share some of our key learnings that are guiding our view of our business, both in the near and long term. We believe this context is valuable given we are not providing detailed financial guidance. In a moment, Meghan will share some directional color for you on Q2 and the full year.  Let me start by highlighting the strength of our management team. Our full leadership team came together. Our efforts demonstrated our strengths of being globally coordinated and regionally empowered. We stood up a global COVID-19 response team comprised of cross-functional leaders to ensure our actions were informed and appropriate, based on conditions on the ground in each market. As a leadership team, we have never been more aligned globally. The current environment has advanced cooperation across our regions, and we're using the learnings from China to guide our actions in other regions that are now in the recovery phase. Let me shift gears now and speak to the broader lululemon community and our stakeholder relationships. Our collective, including our employees, ambassadors, guests, vendors and landlords has always come first. We acted swiftly during the quarter to support our collective in this crisis by closing the majority of our stores, committing to pay protection for all our employees, launching our We Stand Together fund to assist our employees who were directly impacted by COVID-19, launching our ambassador relief fund and continuing to pay our rent and pay for committed merchandise orders. We believe that by supporting our collective and helping them navigate the day-to-day realities of this period, we will build even stronger relationships and increase the already strong loyalty and trust in lululemon. These decisions are right for our people and for our brand. While there is a near-term impact on our P&L, these investments will serve us well over the long term. I'd also like to highlight the strength and resiliency of our supply chain and distribution network. As our e-commerce business spiked throughout the quarter, we were able to harness the power of our agile distribution network to ensure guests continue to receive a high level of service. We recently implemented intelligent sourcing capabilities that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to route e-commerce orders through our distribution network in the most efficient way. The benefits include increased delivery speed to guests, minimizing costs and efficiently utilizing inventory pools to help reduce markdowns. In terms of inventory management, we acted quickly so that we align future deliveries with our new view of demand. We benefit from an inventory with a relatively high percentage of core product, about 40% overall, that has a shelf life beyond the current season and with limited markdown risk. And while we did see some of our factories in affected regions temporarily shut down, our diversified vendor base has served us well in navigating the day-to-day. Overall, these actions resulted in ensuring we had inventory to fulfill guest demand as our e-commerce business continued to accelerate, built capacity to ensure guests continued to receive the strong service levels as volume increased and we are positioned well from an inventory standpoint for the second half of the year and maintain an ability to react to multiple demand scenarios.  When looking more closely at our e-commerce business, guests continue to respond to the newness we introduced into our assortments. We leveraged our Science of Feel innovation platform to bring innovation to the market, and Sun will share additional details with you in a moment. We have been investing in our sites in our mobile app for the last several quarters to enhance the guest experience. These investments have improved functionality, including checkout, navigation, search browse and the speed of our sites. And I'm thrilled to see how well these strategic investments are paying off. In recent weeks, we've seen order volumes equivalent to what we experienced during the holiday season in December. As I stated earlier, our e-commerce comps increased 70% in quarter 1 and 125% in April. I'm excited that we were able to create more online growth globally despite the challenges of COVID-19. While our stores were closed in Europe and APAC, the work and investments we have made in our regional sites took center stage and brought to the forefront the considerable potential for our brand across each market and the role e-commerce can play to grow our business. Europe delivered a stellar 170% e-commerce comp in quarter 1. And in Australia, e-commerce comps increased nearly 150%. Our brand is clearly resonating in our international markets, and we continue to believe we can quadruple this business from 2018 levels by 2023. For the e-commerce business overall, our strength was broad-based, driven by both core product and new innovations. From a guest perspective, a healthy combination of existing guests, new guests and store-only guests beginning to transact with us online drove performance. These trends are very encouraging and should drive our growth into the future as we continue to manage these relationships moving forward.  As we have managed the business through the COVID-19 phases and entered the recovery phase, we have not taken our eye off the future. We have accelerated our innovation in key areas and have prioritized investments in our key growth initiatives. In the early days of the pandemic, we launched our Community Carries On portal on our e-commerce sites globally. This hub allows our guests, both existing and new, to live the Sweatlife through a number of virtual channels. More recently, we launched our digital educator service. This program allows guests to chat with educators via video to help them discover new products, answer their questions on fit, or help them find a gift. This program speaks to the power of our omni-educators and the engagement they can have with our guests, whether in-store or online. We have clearly seen our guests interact with us in new ways via our digital offerings. We expect these behaviors and routines will continue as we move forward. We also believe that at home, virtual workouts will be an additive component of sweat regimens well into the future even as studios reopen and return to normal operations, and we intend to continue to be there for our guests for all their sweaty pursuits, both inside or outside their homes. Let me update you now on where we stand with the store openings and our outlook on the future. As of today, we have reopened approximately 300 store locations across North America, Europe, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. We will reopen the remainder of our stores when it is safe to do so in each community. While we're excited with the early results in our reopened stores and the acceleration we've seen in our e-commerce business, we recognize that many unknowns continue to exist in the external environment. We are moving forward with new store openings in strategic locations, such as Greater China and continuing to invest in our future, but we are also being financially prudent as we move forward. We operate under the principle that we will not take an action in the near term that will hurt our business or our brand in the long term. We have removed $130 million from our originally budgeted SG&A spend for the year and have identified additional opportunities should the ramp we're currently anticipating revenue, failed to materialize. I'd now like to turn it over to Sun, who will share some product highlights. Sun? Sun Choe : Thanks, Calvin. First, I'd like to voice my support of Calvin's opening comments on the global movement to eradicate racial injustice and discrimination. I am a person of color and an immigrant, who through hard work and lucky breaks, have been able to overcome racial barriers that tragically still exist today. I am proud to be part of lululemon and to be part of the team committed to driving meaningful and enduring change. Thank you. And with that, I'm happy to be here to share our product results. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel product platform to solve guests' unmet needs and fuel our future growth. We brought new innovation to our assortment in Q1, and I'm excited with what we have untapped for the coming months and quarters. Despite COVID-related store closures, we saw strong demand across key areas of the business driven by the following : One, continued innovation with new launches in the train category; two, the new normal of working and sweating from home; and three, our ongoing ability to leverage our core franchises. Let me share a few highlights on each. From an innovation standpoint, early in Q1, we relaunched our proprietary Everlux fabric in 2 new styles, Wunder Train and Invigorate. These styles are designed for train and our guest response was strong to both. In fact, we saw virtually no cannibalization within our key pants styles, and our women's pants business was one of our best-performing categories in the quarter. Midway through the quarter, as our guests began adjusting to working and sweating from home, we saw a significant increase in demand for our Yoga products, including our Align bottoms, Yoga mats and blocks. We are also seeing our guests gravitate to our train products. In women's, we saw strong demand for Wunder Train and Invigorate bottoms, as I previously mentioned; and for men, we saw strength in our search, pant and jogger as well as our License to Train pant and jogger. Even prior to COVID, we identified significant opportunity to grow our train business for men, much like we have for women, by introducing additional styles of performance pants. We will continue to leverage this opportunity going forward. Finally, when looking at our core franchises, we expanded both our Align and Swiftly collections in Q1. In Align, we expanded into tops with the tank. This is particularly exciting because it is the first time we've expanded an existing bottoms franchise into tops, and the style has been a huge success for us so far. We see this tank being a key growth driver in our tops business and see further runway for us to leverage some of our other pant franchises in similar ways. We also relaunched our Swiftly franchise with Swiftly 2.0. The technology behind the Swiftly makes it ideal for use in running and training, and our recent updates include shorter lengths, enhanced fit characteristics and improved shape retention. Guest response to our enhanced versions of our Swiftly franchise has been strong, and we are excited to build upon the success in our tops business. Looking forward, I'm thrilled with what we have on the horizon to expand our share of closet with our on-the-move category for women. I don't want to give too much away, but later this summer, we'll be launching 3 new pant styles meant for out-of-studio use, but which leverage our expertise in fit, technical fabric and construction that we are famous for in our performance leggings. It is clear to me that the desire to wear technical apparel, which also offers comfort, is here to stay. We do not believe that guests will be willing to forgo either one of these attributes even as they return to their normal lives over the coming months. We at lululemon are extremely well positioned here based on the expertise we've developed over many years, driven by the Science of Feel. The entire body of work underpinning this platform relates to how guests want to feel while wearing clothes, and we've always used this as our foundational principles supporting our innovation. We will continue to leverage this expertise to drive our growth going forward. With that, I'd like to thank our entire product organization, their ingenuity and dedication during this virtual and uncertain time. We remain confident in our innovation pipeline, and I am buoyed by the team's steadfast passion for beautifully solving our guests' unmet needs and how they are creatively responding to the ever-changing climate. And now, over to Meghan to take you through our financials. Meghan? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Sun. I'll start by providing details on our Q1 performance. And although we are not providing specific guidance, I will offer some color on our outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the year. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. For Q1, total net revenue decreased 17% to $652 million as our business was impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and related store closures. In our digital channel, we posted a 70% constant dollar comp increase on top of a 35% increase last year. Our store comp definition removed stores that were closed for greater than 30 days. Given the significant number of temporary store closures in Q1, we do not feel store comp is a meaningful metric to evaluate performance. Therefore, we are not reporting total comps or store comps. As we evaluate our top line performance, we are focused on total revenue, our digital business trends and open store recovery trends, which I will offer some additional color on as we move into our outlook. Square footage increased 15% versus last year, driven by the addition of 34 net new stores since Q1 of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 4 new stores : 2 in Mainland China, 1 in South Korea and 1 in Hong Kong, and we are pleased with initial performance. Excluding the temporary closures related to COVID-19, we closed 6 stores in the quarter. These were predominantly the ivivva-branded store closures, which we had planned. None of our permanent store closures were related to COVID-19. We also completed 3 planned optimizations. In terms of our digital channel, e-comm contributed approximately $352 million of top line or 54% of total revenue. Our constant dollar e-comm comps were consistent with our Q4 trend through the end of March. And as Calvin mentioned, we saw this accelerate to approximately 125% in April. We experienced accelerated strength in traffic and conversion, which increased over 40% and 25%, respectively. Traffic was driven by channel shift, coupled with investments in digital marketing; and conversion, driven by guest response to our products and the investments we have made in our global digital platforms to improve guest experience. Gross profit for the first quarter was $334 million or 51.3% of net revenue compared to 53.9% of net revenue in Q1 2019. The gross margin decline of 260 basis points include a 180-basis-point increase in overall product margin resulting from lower product costs and favorability in product mix. We did not take any significant inventory write-downs in the quarter. This was offset by 330 basis points of deleverage on occupancy and depreciation, 100 basis points of deleverage on product and supply chain costs and 20 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Moving to SG&A. Our approach has been to protect against downside while also ensuring we continue to invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $302 million or 46.3% of net revenue compared to 37.4% of net revenue in Q1 2019. The deleverage in the quarter resulted predominantly from lower revenue due to COVID-19-related store closures and our commitment to continue to pay our employees through this period of disruption, which was partially offset by the recognition of some government wage subsidies. Foreign exchange, both translation and revaluation contributed 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $33 million or 5% of net revenue compared to 16.5% of net revenue in Q1 2019. Tax expense for the quarter was $5.3 million or 15.6% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 26.4% a year ago. This decrease in our effective tax rate compared to last year relates primarily to additional tax deductions for stock-based compensation during the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $28.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.74 in Q1 of 2019.  Capital expenditures were approximately $52 million for the quarter compared to approximately $68 million in the first quarter last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, technology spend to support our business growth, digital channel and analytics capabilities and supply chain investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in total liquidity. We have $823 million in cash and cash equivalents and $400 million of available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 41% versus last year and was $626 million at the end of Q1. We view our vendors as partners, and we have not used order cancellations as an inventory or cash management strategy. Our product teams have worked hard to reflow our deliveries for the second half of the year based on inventories on hand and our revised view of demand, and we have honored our commitments to our partners in Q1 and Q2. These commitments, coupled with our store closures, resulted in the Q1 inventory increase and will likely result in a higher increase at the end of Q2 before levels begin to moderate in the second half of the year. I'd also reiterate our clearance strategies have not changed. We have historically relied on 4 vehicles to clear merchandise : in-store markdowns, online markdowns, our outlets and occasional warehouse sales. We currently have no plans to veer from these methods. In addition, approximately 40% of our inventory is comprised of core styles, which are generally seasonless in nature and carry minimal markdown risk. We repurchased approximately $64 million in stock in Q1 for temporarily pausing our share repurchase program as part of our COVID-19 cash management strategy. We have approximately $264 million remaining on our current $500 million repurchase plan. Let me shift now to current trends and share with you some color on how we're looking at the remainder of the year. Due to the dynamic nature of the macro environment, we are not yet returning to our historical cadence of providing specific guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year. We've been looking at a number of scenarios in order to ensure we have the appropriate flexibility to manage the business through a range of outcomes. Important in this has been closely monitoring recovery trends in open markets as well as our digital business to inform both our forecasting and investment decision making. After closing all of our stores in Europe and North America in mid-March, we began the process to welcome guests back mid-May. We currently have approximately 300 stores open in the following regions : approximately 190 in North America, 13 in Europe, 53 in Asia and 39 in Australia and New Zealand, and all of our distribution centers are up and running. We are very pleased with the response we're seeing from our guest scenarios where our stores are open. In China, where our stores have been up and running the longest, we've seen store comps increase approximately 20% in most recent weeks. We're also pleased with the early response we're seeing in North America, which is exceeding our expectations. In addition, our digital business has remained strong throughout, and we've continued to invest in our online and fulfillment experience to ensure we serve our guests and capture demand. For Q2, we expect comps in our digital business to be relatively consistent with our April trend of approximately 125%. Looking forward, for the business overall, we anticipate the trend in total revenue growth to improve sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. Total revenue in Q2 could decline in the high single-digits, improving to a high single-digit increase in Q4. We expect revenue in our digital channel to remain strong in Q2, but moderate in second half as the store business continues to recover. With regard to earnings per share, we anticipate EPS rate declines relative to last year in Q2 and Q3, with a return to EPS growth in Q4. The Q2 decline will likely be better than the decline in Q1, although I would note likely worse than what is implied by current Q2 Factset consensus estimates. In terms of SG&A for the full year, we have identified $130 million in SG&A savings relative to our original budget. However, we expect to deleverage for the year as we continue to pay our people and prudently invest in select growth initiatives on a lower than originally anticipated sales base. We have identified contingency plans for further SG&A reductions beyond the $130 million should the recovery period be more prolonged than what we are currently anticipating. In terms of capital spending, we expect CapEx for 2020 to be below our original budget and generally in line with last year. We are prioritizing spending on digital and omni initiatives and fulfillment capabilities while pulling back somewhat on new store openings and remodels. Before handing it back to Calvin, I'd like to reiterate that our financial position remains strong. Our balance sheet strength and flexibility in our business model is enabling us to effectively manage through the uncertainties of the current macro environment while protecting our people and prudently investing in the future. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks for the update, Meghan. I'd like to close by letting you know that we remain fully committed to our Power of Three growth plan, which we laid out for you last year. COVID-19 is impacting our performance in 2020 but we remain focused on our 3 key growth pillars and our goals to double men's, double digital and quadruple international by year-end 2023. Within our quarter 1 results, we have much to celebrate, including seeing retail-only guests beginning to transact with us online and transition towards becoming an even more loyal omni-guest. The overall strength and acceleration of our e-commerce business globally with breakout results in Europe and Australia, strong performance from our core franchises, new innovations and the strength of our product pipeline, and the early recovery we are seeing in reopened stores with ongoing strength in our e-commerce business. Finally, I'd like to thank our teams around the globe for their resilience, agility and passion during this period. The enthusiasm for our guests and our community, shared by everyone across lululemon, demonstrates the enduring strength of our brand. Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt McClintock of Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : Yes, everyone, and may I say congrats, good job to the entire lululemon organization. Calvin, and probably Sun, too, I wanted to start with consumer behavior changes because prior to COVID, there seemed to be a shift towards comfort within the apparel industry, and it seemed to be something that was in your wheelhouse. And now that COVID happened, it seems like this shift towards product that feels good, et cetera, has accelerated. And I want to know, is that a onetime acceleration? Or is that something that you think the trend will actually now remain at heightened levels of growth? And then when you brought up market share today, I was wondering if you could talk about, are your market share gains, the function of that, maybe you're just more trend-aligned with this? Or is that maybe because some of your competitors have wholesale businesses that rely on more challenged distribution points? That's my first question. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. And I'll start off, and I'll tackle the 2 parts of the question, starting with the last part, which is around market share. And the market share that we look at is the athletic apparel categories within -- I quoted a North American U.S. number. And it definitely is a category that has performed better than other apparel categories over the last number of quarters for a variety of reasons. I think it is comfort. I think it is lifestyle. I think it is a shift to less formal wear. And we've always performed well and beaten the growth in that category. In particular, for this quarter, our performance, I think, does show a shift -- a greater shift to the guest to both our brand as well as to the category, as you mentioned, which I think serves well as we look forward to where our opportunities continue to be. Heading into this, there is less behavior and want. And certain things won't change as a result of COVID-19 and definitely some things will change. And I think the things that won't change play to our strength, and that's living an active, healthy lifestyle. And the things that will change equally play to our strength, and that is more work-from-home, looking for comfort, the role that digital and omni play in that behavior and wants that the guest has. So the shift is, in my opinion, very positive for our brand and the role that we play in it. It has been something we've been building and innovating towards. It's what's driven the success of our products through the work that Sun and the team has done. Sun mentioned On The Move for women's, which is something we've been working on and we'll be launching in quarter 2, which we're very excited about. Again, I think, timely, but something that has been worked on for quite some time to deliver a very unique, exciting product. So I'm excited about the shifts that are happening and how it plays within our category and our role within that. And what we experienced in quarter 1 and will, quite honestly, for a little bit through 2020, are some short-term operational challenges. But the demand for the brand and the demand for the category, I feel, has only strengthened through this. And those short-term operational challenges will mitigate. They will go away. And I feel very good about the long-term position and our strategy and focus on the power of 3 behind that. Matthew McClintock : And then my follow-up is just you said that you can react to multiple demand scenarios in the back half of this year. And this is an industry where manufacturing can often be a barrier to entry, a constraint. And I was just wondering if you can maybe comment a little bit on how you treated your manufacturers and your ability to maybe get that capacity at a time where, if possible, there could be a lot of -- I don't know of the out of stocks, but a lot of people were trying to run and trying to case at the same time. Calvin McDonald : No, for sure. And I'll take it from just a very high-level strategic position. And it really is interesting when I reflect and look back on the quarter, the different moves that we shifted to where early on with COVID 19, when it was predominantly in China and we were closing our stores, we were very much focused on ensuring our raw material sourcing was well-secured, working with many of our partners on building out sort of quantity of raw materials, so we could get to production of finished goods. And then as it continued to expand, we started to shift and close stores. It started to shift to demand and total quantity that we would need, making decisions in the short term to support our vendor partners, as I mentioned, equally looking forward to quarter 3, quarter 4 and what our current buys were and how we wanted to make adjustments to those. And where we stand coming out of quarter 1 is, obviously, a higher inventory number than some of our peers, but that's because we haven't actioned through markdowns. We haven't actioned by pushing back and not honoring commitments we made. And we have a large portion of our inventory that's not seasonal, that is core, that are colors that sell year-long, and there's a high demand for that product. And as stores open up, that demand will only increase. And as we look forward to the end of the year, we plan to manage, through having more inventory now into managing into more of a traditional inventory level while able to work with our vendor base on pivoting and reacting quicker on styles and/or colors if we deem necessary. So there is a lot of flexibility built in. And I think the commitments we've made and where we stand right now allows us to play in a very effective way heading into the back half of this year. Matthew McClintock : I really appreciate it. I wish you all the best of luck. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Calvin, maybe can you speak to the interplay that you're seeing today between e-commerce up over 100% and brick-and-mortar productivity as stores reopen in North America? Maybe specifically, what kind of store comps are you seeing today in North America? And are you seeing e-commerce moderate in any regions where stores have reopened so far? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matthew. I think it's too early to really assess where we're going to sort of find the new norm and mix. What we are seeing -- and I would put this into context with our own team. We have one of the most productive retail models in the industry. Smaller stores, highly productive per square foot, which means we are moving through a lot of volume in small space. And the reality is, as we open up these stores, there are operational constraints through social distancing that we are honoring and respecting and supporting to protect our teams that are going to restrict us hitting those levels as quickly as we might like or, quite frankly, as quickly as the demand of our guest is as a result. I think that we're going to see our store productivity improve as we move through the year. It is currently in and around 75. Some stores are at 100%. It really does balance between market and time in. Stores are doing a wonderful job in how to service the guests and address the needs outside of the store, so we can get those that would have shopped inside the store. But that's how I'm viewing the store productivity number. Heading into quarter 2 with e-commerce, we mentioned growth coming out of April of 125%. We've seen that accelerate coming into May and June. I think throughout the quarter, we're going to probably see that settle back in and around the 125% range. But as of right now, we have about 50% of our fleet in North America open. We're happy with the productivity numbers. We know it's going to be a little bit longer for us to hit our industry-leading numbers. But e-comm has currently accelerated, and we'll see where that mix is back. But I think both are just an indication of a strong demand for the product, short-term operational challenges that we're working through, but very positive in terms of the demand for the product and what we're seeing from the guest. Matthew Boss : That's great to hear. And then just a follow-up on gross margin. What's the best way to think about mix versus markdowns as we think about product margins, maybe in the second quarter or back half of the year relative to the 180 basis points of expansion that you saw in the first quarter? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Matt. It's Meghan. We're not going to provide specific guidance on product margin as we move throughout the year, but what we are providing is that we expect gross margin pressure to be slightly more in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1. And then we also expect gross margin performance in the second half of the year to be better than the first half as sales recover. I'd also note that we are expecting $40 million in overhead cost savings within our margin bucket, similar to the buckets we called out in the $130 million in SG&A savings we expect for the full year. Operator : Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to follow-up on the inventory number. Can you talk to what proportion of that inventory is core? And then also, how much of your buys have you committed to for the back half at this point? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, thanks, it's Meghan. Yes. So in terms of the inventory proportion that is core, it's 40 -- approximately 40% of our assortment. We have, at this point, committed to our second half purchases through winter. We do have some flexibility within that as a large part of our assortment is core in that 40%. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : And first, let me just say that your comments and statements on Black Lives Matters is noticed and appreciated. So thank you for that. In terms of the P&L, just as we think about the channel mix, with such strong and robust online growth, could you just remind us of how we should think about the profitability and margins in that channel and how they may differ, if at all, from your sales. I mean, your store sales. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Paul. So our e-comm channel is more profitable than our store channel. However, we do look at the business as an omnichannel business. Over the longer term, as the situation normalizes, we expect to remain committed to our long-term growth strategy of sales in the mid-teens, modest gross margin expansion, modest SG&A leverage and EPS growth in excess of sales. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen. John Kernan : Congrats on all the momentum. Could you just dive in a little bit more in terms of the in-store trends you're seeing currently? I think you said you have about 50% of the fleet in North America open. Just given the digital guidance you're giving us, I'm curious in terms of how you want us to frame our models for the in-store sales and what you're seeing versus what you're seeing right now? Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks, John. It's Meghan. We have approximately 60% of our stores open at this point globally. 100% in Australia and New Zealand, 95% in Asia, 60% in Europe and 50% in North America. We do expect that we'll open almost 100% of our stores by the end of June. If we think about the productivity we're seeing within those stores, as Calvin mentioned, in the initial weeks, we've seen some variability. It's still very early, but we're seeing that in the range of 75% to over 100% of last year's productivity. And at the same time, we've seen our e-commerce business accelerate in early weeks of the quarter. As I shared, we expect total revenue to improve in Q2 to a high single-digit decline. And we expect e-comm for the quarter to grow at approximately 125%. So moderating throughout the quarter as stores ramp and reopen. John Kernan : Helpful. I guess my follow-up is I think Celeste was on the call a couple of quarters ago talking about the larger experiential stores that you wanted to invest in, and I think would become 10% of the overall store base at some point. Calvin, are you still committed to that? Have you seen anything in terms of consumer behavior that would make you want to back away from that commitment? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, John. Listen, it's hard. My first response would be no. I think this is very difficult times to evaluate our -- the value of our retail fleet and to make any dramatic shifts and changes from a strategy that, 8 weeks ago, was relevant. Guests were shopping, and plus 20% was our combined comp, and our stores across our very flexible fleet were performing incredibly well. There's no doubt coming out that our online business, I believe, will find a new norm that's higher than where we began. That we definitely know we're going to have more omni-guests, which is incredibly exciting, because an omni-guest shops more often and spends more with us and is more loyal to the brand. But they're still an omni-guest, meaning they shop both physical and our online business. And I think it's too early to determine if there's going to be any dramatic shifts. We have very powerful stores. They are core to our connection with the community and how we build the brand and the loyalty. Recruiting guests, it's our #1 vehicle, still to recruit guests. And we were already shifting to a very flexible scenario of smaller seasonal into the experiential stores. So we will come out. We will continue to manage and see guest behavior. My anticipation is that those larger stores, the experiential and what they're delivering in the community and the role that they were going to play, were always designed through an omni-lens, and these are just going to be stronger, more powerful locations for us. And we were never looking at this as being the dominant number of stores in our fleet. We're being very selective. And I think there's, in fact, a lot of exciting opportunities of the role they can play within the omni-lens being rooted in the community and how guests are interacting with us, both online, virtually, as well as in stores. So nothing and shouldn't anticipate a significant shift. We'll learn, but still very committed to the growth in our store fleet, because we know we have a -- relative to others, a moderate number of stores and still opportunity to grow in markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. I guess my first question is just on China. I think you said that brick-and-mortar comps were up 20% for those -- the doors have been opened. Can you just break down what you've seen in terms of traffic versus ticket? And then how has digital been performing in China? Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, absolutely. And I'll walk through sort of coming in and the progression through sort of the 3 phases I laid out into -- in Q2, because I do think it's -- we use it as an interesting and helpful benchmark of how stores will build. And saying that, the rest of the markets, as they come on, are accelerating this growth curve to getting back to sort of a productivity level quicker than what we saw our stores in China. But heading into the -- coming out of quarter 4, and obviously, we were impacted much quicker in Q1 in China, the e-commerce business did accelerate relative to the incoming trend. We don't share specific numbers, but it was a meaningful acceleration as we close stores. When stores reopened, what we saw was it took a number of weeks to get back into a positive comp in March. The total business was positive, but that was driven through a very successful e-commerce growth as a mix where our store comp growth was still negative. And then into April, we saw single-digit growth as stores got closer to sort of breaking -- or positive comp to no longer declining, and our e-commerce business continued to be strong. Most of that in-stores was driven by conversion and ordering. We have seen a slower return to traffic numbers. But as stores got to growth, and as we've mentioned, they've been in the last few weeks, getting now into that 20-plus percent comp growth number, and we've been holding very strong e-commerce growth. So our China business has really returned to where it was pre-COVID-19 in that marketplace. It's driven on conversion in that highly engaged guests. Traffic is improving, but is definitely probably in retail the trailing metric in that sales equation. Erinn Murphy : Super helpful from a progression perspective. And then I guess my second question is just on your loyalty program. I recognize it's only in a handful of stores or state or city, if I should say. But have you noticed anything meaningfully different on the digital trends from those cities or those metro areas versus the rest of North America? And then how has COVID-19 shaped how you're thinking about rolling out your loyalty program or your membership program further? Calvin McDonald : No, great question. We've -- in particular, we launched a number of digital sweat offerings to our guests. It was one of those areas where I'm so proud of the way the team jumped on the opportunity to innovate. And we really tested and learned and accelerated a lot of initiatives forward so that we could really be present and offer what they were looking for. And that's across Instagram, our YouTube channel, Facebook. It's leveraging our ambassador community to really provide those. We launched a move event on Strava, which the results are significant in terms of the number of miles ran or bike or other activity and the number of guests that participated. So really energized about the engagement that guests are having with our brand with digital sweat.  And also, one of the things that I think is very exciting is it validated what we know, which is the power of this brand and the relationship with our guests and the ability to be in conversation with them and have them interact with us outside of just purely transactional needs. We are in daily conversations with a number of our guests. They were interacting with our brand day-to-day, week-to-week. So when it came time to buy, when it came time to think about the category, just reinforces the role that our brand plays in their lives and the role that we can play in their sweat. So excited about what we're seeing with digital. As it relates to membership, the program today is a balance between physical sweat as a driver product. And we always had planned on providing digital solutions as well as a part of the membership package. We have pushed out a broader city launch to early '21 at this point in time as a result of, quite honestly, it's more about the uncertainty than it is about guest engagement and demand for this membership program. In the cities, we've had Austin, Denver, Chicago and Edmonton, incredible engagement. They've continued to be engaged in the program even during this. They've engaged in our online activities. We have some unique offerings planned for them. We are going to repeat in those cities this fall. We're going to add one new city to the program so we can continue to learn. But we pushed off the broader launch that we had planned for to early '21, more because of the uncertainty than really demand. Demand remains very strong. We're excited about it. We're going to be able to add to the guest mix on that. Some more to come. But there will be, in those cities plus one more this year, is the current plan. Erinn Murphy : Great. Super helpful. All the best. Sun Choe : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from Alex Walvis of Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : My question is on the demographic of new guests that are joining you online. Are you seeing a material different demographic that's new to the lululemon brand during this period of disruption? And then maybe a second question on the stores that have opened. Is there any discrepancy by geography or store type or anything else you care to call out on which stores are performing better out of the gates versus those that are a little slower to ramp? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. I'll take the first part of the question and let Meghan talk to the store performance and if there's any differences across the markets. In terms of the guest perspective, we had a wonderful balance across a lot of demographics in new guest acquisition prior, and I would say they haven't really fundamentally changed. If there was one that's noteworthy, our stores and stores, in general, remain a significant acquirer of new guests for a retail business. And we have definitely seen online pick up a portion of that as a result of stores not being open. But our stores, in particular, equally were a significant acquirer of men new guests. And I would just indicate that if there's been any shift in the last few weeks, we've seen an acceleration of more women new guests. As a result, the ratio of men new guests has dipped below our trend. I believe it is only short term. It is a reflection of being online and our physical stores being closed. And the overall health number of new guests across both gender and other profiles, youth and others, is still very, very encouraging and very strong. So I'm trying to share anything that would be a bit of a nuance and difference. But the overall numbers and metrics across all are still very healthy and encouraging as we think about that as a growth channel for us continuing moving forward. And Meghan, did you want to comment on stores? Meghan Frank : Yes. Great. Thanks, Alex. So in terms of differences in what we're seeing in trends, we're not seeing significant differences either by format or location. I would share we're seeing modestly better performance in non-mall locations, and we are benefited by approximately 2/3 of our store locations being outside of malls. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'm excited to be here with you today to provide an update on our performance for the second quarter, share our learnings as we continue to adapt to and navigate the uncertain COVID-19 environment and highlight trends we're seeing in the business as we look forward to the back half of the year. The results we're sharing today demonstrate the strength of the lululemon brand as we face these unexpected times and see the future of retail accelerate through an expansion of e-commerce and digital sweat offerings.  Our product, built with technical innovation and performance fabrics, is ideal for enabling the work-from-home and versatile lifestyle that has grown exponentially in the COVID-19 world. Building upon these components, our acquisition of at-home fitness innovator, MIRROR, and our continued expansion globally demonstrates our ability to navigate the near term while planning for the long-term growth.  Today, I'm joined by Meghan Frank, our SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis, who continues to be a supportive partner as she works with me and the team on strategic and operational finance while our CFO search is ongoing. Alex Grieve, our VP and Controller, is also on the call today and will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A portion.  Before I detail our results, I'd like to speak for a moment about the importance of diversity and inclusion at lululemon. As I mentioned on our last call, we are committed to increasing our investment in education, behavior change and diverse representation within our organization. The Black Lives Matter movement has ignited lululemon and our collective, serving as a powerful catalyst to critically examine our culture and practices. Back in June, we created IDEA, a commitment to create real and lasting change through inclusion, diversity, equity and action. As a company, we are focused on meaningful transformation, shifting our mindsets and behaviors and living into our core value of inclusion every day. I look forward to sharing our progress on this going forward as the diversity of our workforce truly begins to reflect the global communities in which we operate.  Let me turn now to our business performance in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Total revenue increased 2%. Consistent with quarter 1, we are not reporting same-store sales due to the significant number of stores that remained closed during the beginning of the quarter. Our e-commerce business continued to accelerate, with comps in quarter 2 increasing 157%. Gross margin declined 80 basis points, and our product margin was flat with last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74 versus $0.96 last year, and our financial position remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in total liquidity.  As we continue to operate and move through the COVID-19 environment, we are seeing a shift in behavior in terms of working from home, sweating from home and the increased importance of living an active and healthy lifestyle. These trends play to our strengths and set up an opportunity for us to continue to innovate and gain market share. We are learning how our guests are changing their behaviors, and we're adapting and engaging with them in new ways. We remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan, including the doubling of men's, doubling of e-commerce and quadrupling international by 2023. But we also recognize that 2020 is likely an inflection point for retail and for lululemon, with certain changes in guest behaviors likely to endure in the post-COVID-19 world. We believe lululemon is uniquely positioned to engage with our guests when, where and how they want based on the strength of our brand, the strength of our operating model and the investments we've been making across the business.  One of our key strengths is our omni operating model. For the last several years, we've been investing in our ecosystem to ensure we have the capabilities to enable a seamless and enjoyable experience whether guests want to engage with us virtually, in stores or in the community. What we're learning now during the COVID-19 environment is that omni means much more to our guests than simply enabling purchase transactions across our channels. While our recent investments in transactional omni capabilities are clearly paying off as evidenced by our recent results, we have begun to view other areas of our business, including sweat and events through an omni lens. Let me now share some of the details.  As our stores continue to recover, our e-commerce business has accelerated from a 41% comp in quarter 4 of last year to 157% comp in the current quarter. Similar to quarter 1, we've seen a healthy mix of new guests, existing e-commerce guests and historically retail-only guests now shopping with us online. In order to support growth in the business, capture a potential further increase in demand in quarter 4 and ensure our guests continue to receive the highest level of service, we've accelerated investments this year within our e-commerce channel. These investments include developing site enhancements, building our transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities. These further enhancements were on our road map for the next 2 years. And given our e-commerce business has currently accelerated beyond our expectations, we prioritized and pulled forward these investments. We're also continuing to grow our brand and engage with our guests across our international markets. In China, we're experiencing a strong rebound in-store with same-store sales up over 30%, coupled with strength in e-commerce which grew over 130% in quarter 2. And in Europe, a greater than 160% lift in e-commerce is driving our business as guests are engaging with us more online than ever. When looking at store growth in our regions in quarter 2, we opened 9 new locations across Asia and Europe, including our 100th location in APAC, an exciting milestone for our brand in this key growth market.  Let me shift now to speak about the recovery of our store business. While this period continues to be unpredictable, we currently have approximately 97% of our stores open across the globe to serve our guests. On average, our reopened stores are performing at 75% of last year's volume. As you know, our stores are small and designed to be an efficient use of space with high levels of traffic, which results in high productivity. While these are appealing attributes, the current capacity constraints understandably limit the number of guests who can be in the store at one time. While we're seeing traffic declines relative to last year and expect these constraints to endure at least through the end of the year, the underlying health of our brand remains strong. Guests are patiently lining up to get into our stores, both physically and through our virtual tools. Our product continues to resonate well as evidenced by the strength of our e-commerce channel. And while we expect productivity for stores that we've reopened to remain consistent with the current levels for the remainder of the year, we still expect to grow our top line in quarter 3 and quarter 4. We continue to believe physical stores are and always will be an extremely important part of our ecosystem.  From a sales standpoint, our stores are highly productive, and they enable so much more than simply the purchase of apparel by our guests. Our stores are our local hub and communities across the globe, gathering spots for our ambassadors and our connection to local studios, facilitate e-commerce transactions via our ship-from-store and buy online, pick up in-store capabilities and are a portal to bring new guests into our brand, particularly men. This year, we plan to open 30 to 35 net new stores while also accelerating our seasonal store strategy.  In quarter 2, we operated just over 50 seasonal stores, and we plan to increase to approximately 70 in the second half of the year. Our strategy this holiday will include seasonal stores in key centers and markets where we have existing stores to help us mitigate the current capacity constraints. That being said, we are building new and leveraging our current transactional omni capabilities to ensure a quick and seamless shopping experience for both our store and e-commerce guests. Some of our actions include : first, we have evolved our buy online, pick up in-store functionality to buy online, pick up at curbside. Second, we have enabled virtual waitlists so guests no longer have to wait in line and instead can be notified via text when it is their turn to enter the store. This functionality has been particularly well received. In the month of August alone, we had nearly 400,000 individual guests utilizing our virtual waitlist across nearly 280 locations where we implemented the technology. Third, we have continued to expand the number of our omni educators who receive special training, enabling them to help guests in-store and virtually through our guest education center. And fourth, we continue to offer our digital educator and virtual concierge programs, and both initiatives continue to be well received by guests. This innovation demonstrates our consistent ability to be agile and anticipate the evolving needs of our guests.  We have also enabled omni sweatlife capabilities to help our guests stay active, both physically and digitally. Many of our ambassadors have been offering live streams on our social channels, and we now offer digital content as part of our membership program in the cities where our tests are underway. I'm also excited that in August, we were able to convert our annual SeaWheeze Half Marathon into an extremely successful virtual event in which over 23,000 people from more than 100 countries participated, including myself. We partnered with the running app, Strava, and offered a 10K distance in addition to our half marathon. We also curated virtual training programs for both races to help runners prepare and compete at the height of their ability.  Shifting now to product innovation. Our guests are now working and sweating from home more than ever, and we continue to be there for them with merchandise that offers versatility and flexibility powered by the technical innovation of Science of Feel. I'm excited to share the ways in which we are making our assortment relevant to more of our guests. Last month, we expanded our On The Move collection with the introduction of new pant styles for both women and men supported by our Everyday is a Workout campaign. These styles leverage our expertise in technical construction and developing technical fabrics, but they were explicitly designed for out-of-studio use. For women, we launched the City Sleek 5 Pocket powered by our Warpstreme fabric. And for men, we rolled out the Bowline pant in our new Utilitech fabric.  Initial response to these new styles has been strong. In particular, the City Sleek has exceeded our expectations by a factor of 2, was the #1 performing style in the company during the initial days of the launch, and we're chasing into additional inventory to help keep up with demand. While we will always lead with performance-based apparel and technical innovations, we see continued opportunity to grow the On The Move portion of the business for both women and men.  I'm also pleased with our move toward more inclusive sizing. This is an important step forward for lululemon, and I'm excited that later this month we will start to offer some of our core styles in sizes 0 to 20, and this is just the beginning. By the end of 2021, the majority of our women's assortment will be available in our more inclusive size range. When looking at the men's business overall, we saw a sequential improvement relative to quarter 1, although it lagged behind the growth in the women's business. As the work-from-home and sweat-from-home environment continues, we have seen our male guests respond more enthusiastically to shorts, sweats and hoodies. Our merchant teams are chasing into these categories so we can maximize these businesses based on the current shift in demand. And our brand teams are focused on continuing to raise awareness among men and our dual-gender lines such as On The Move provide an opportunity to grow in both the men's and women's business.  Our opportunity within product remains in the early innings. We have only just begun to leverage our work within the Science of Feel innovation platform, and we have ample ways to expand our key categories : run, train, yoga and on the move. In addition, the lululemon brand is positioned well to take advantage of the shifts we're seeing in the marketplace towards apparel that provides versatility, comfort and technical innovation.  Before shifting to our outlook, let me update you on 2 of our omni guest initiatives, MIRROR and membership. MIRROR is a further example of how we're considering and evolving new aspects of our business through an omni lens. As you know, we closed on the MIRROR transaction in early July, and I couldn't be more excited with the potential MIRROR brings to lululemon and the opportunities lululemon brings to MIRROR. As I stated when we announced the acquisition, MIRROR is a stand-alone revenue generating company, and their management team will continue to operate the business from their offices in New York. There is no need for heavy integration work and we have begun the process of bringing them into the lululemon family so that we benefit from our collective strengths. We're on track to begin offering the MIRROR in 10 to 15 lululemon stores in the United States by early quarter 4, when we'll also begin leveraging our digital channels to help build their brand awareness. From a financial standpoint, we continue to believe that MIRROR will be modestly dilutive to earnings this year. We plan to ramp up marketing and advertising spend in the second half of the year to fuel MIRROR's momentum during the holiday season and into 2021. The initial work we're doing with MIRROR during the upcoming fall season will set the stage for next year when we expect to be more aggressively leveraging the power of the lululemon ecosystem to grow the MIRROR business. Meghan will provide you with more details in a moment.  Shifting to membership, I'm excited to announce we are continuing to test our program in Edmonton, Chicago and Denver. And starting this week, we'll also bring the program to our guests in Toronto for the first time. The membership program continues to celebrate community connection and provides a range of offerings, such as special products, dedicated online sweat classes and inspiring guest speakers to extend the lululemon experience. With COVID-19 in mind, I'm proud of how our teams have evolved to a virtual event format with plans to return to studio classes and physical gatherings once safe to do so. As we continue to test and learn through membership and integrate MIRROR into the lululemon family, we are gaining valuable insights on guest behavior that can help us further improve our offering and enhance the ability of our guests to fully experience the sweatlife.  Let me now share our thoughts on how we're approaching the second half of the year. Meghan will share some specifics regarding our financial outlook, but I wanted to provide you with our planning framework for the fall season. Our starting point is that the environment remains uncertain. COVID is not yet contained in many of the markets where we operate. And while we expect the recovery to advance, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios this fall and particularly for the holiday season. We have pulled forward several IT investments related to our e-commerce business, increased our DC and fulfillment capabilities and are continuing to grow the ranks of our omni educators to ensure our guests receive the service and experience they are accustomed to should our e-commerce business spike even more in quarter 4. We continue to work with our vendors to ensure the proper timing of upcoming merchandise flows and can pull forward deliveries of select styles should unanticipated demand develop. And we continue to protect our downside by tightly managing expenses and the outlay of capital. Let me now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'll start by providing details on our Q2 performance. And although we are not providing specific guidance, I will offer some color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted Q2 financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR beginning on July 7, the date the transaction closed, but exclude $11.5 million of pretax acquisition-related costs. You can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-Q for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.  For Q2, total net revenue increased 2% to $903 million. And while we are still in the COVID-19 recovery phase, this was above our expectations of a high single digit decline. In our digital channel, we posted a 157% constant dollar comp increase on top of a 31% increase last year. Given the significant number of temporary store closures in Q2, we do not feel store comp is a meaningful metric to evaluate performance. As we evaluate our top line performance, we will continue to be focused on total revenue, our digital business trends and open store recovery trends, which I will offer some additional color on as we move into our outlook.  Square footage increased 15% versus last year driven by the addition of 46 net new stores since Q2 of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 17 new stores : 8 in North America, 4 in Mainland China, 3 in other markets across Asia and 2 in Europe. We also completed 2 planned optimizations. In terms of our digital channel, e-comm contributed approximately $554 million of top line or 61% of total revenue. Our constant dollar e-comm comps exceeded our expectations, increasing 157%. Excluding the impact of our online warehouse sale, e-comm comps grew 137%.  While we were pleased with our online warehouse sale results, I did want to highlight that overall for the quarter, we saw strength in full price sales as reflected in our flat product margin results year-over-year. In terms of e-comm drivers, we continue to see strength in traffic and conversion, which increased over 90% and 45%, respectively. Traffic was driven by channel shift, coupled with investments in digital marketing. And conversion continues to benefit from guest response to our product and the investments we've made in our global digital platforms to improve guest experience.  Gross profit for the second quarter was $489.5 million or 54.2% of net revenue compared to 55% of net revenue in Q2 2019. The gross margin decline of 80 basis points was driven by 130 basis points of deleverage on DC-related costs, which was offset by 40 basis points of product and cost leverage and 30 basis points of occupancy and depreciation leverage. Product margin was flat year-over-year, inclusive of our online warehouse sale, as lower product costs and product mix offset higher markdowns. We also experienced a 20 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange.  Moving to SG&A. Our approach in the current environment has been to protect against downside while also ensuring we continue to invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $353 million or 39.1% of net revenue compared to 36% of net revenue in Q2 2019. The deleverage in the quarter resulted predominantly from lower revenue due to COVID-19-related store closures and our commitment to continue to pay our employees through this period of disruption, costs associated with COVID-related supplies and PPE, deleverage on depreciation and deleverage from MIRROR. These were partially offset by expense reductions relative to our original budget, coupled with the recognition of some government wage subsidies in the quarter.  Adjusted operating income for the quarter was approximately $136 million or 15% of net revenue compared to 19% of net revenue in Q2 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $39.2 million or 28.9% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 26.4% a year ago. The increase in our adjusted effective tax rate compared to last year relates primarily to changes in guidance associated with certain U.S. tax reform measures, which reduced the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $96.3 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.96 in Q2 of 2019.  Capital expenditures were approximately $53 million for the quarter compared to approximately $67 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, technology spend to support our business growth, digital channel and analytics capabilities and supply chain investments.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of total liquidity. We have $523 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $700 million of available capacity under our committed revolving credit facilities. Inventory grew 36% versus last year and was $673 million at the end of Q2. We now believe Q1 was the high point for year-over-year inventory increases for 2020. We expect levels in the second half to moderate further and increase in the 20% to 30% range. Our repurchase program remains on pause as part of our COVID-19 cash management strategy. We have approximately $264 million remaining on our current $500 million repurchase plan.  Let me shift now to current trends and share with you some color on how we're looking at the remainder of the year. Due to the dynamic nature of the macro environment, we are not yet returning to our historical cadence of providing specific guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year. We continue to plan for a number of scenarios in order to ensure we have the appropriate flexibility to manage the business through a range of second half outcomes. These include scenarios around store trend recovery in light of continued COVID-19 impacts across the globe. We are focused on and benefiting from leveraging our omni model and digital strength as we navigate this uncertainty. We've continued to see guests shift between channels, which has driven outsized growth on our e-commerce sites. As Calvin mentioned, we pulled forward investments in our digital channel to ensure our guests continue to receive an elevated experience when shopping our sites and to maximize second half and holiday business.  In terms of stores, we currently have approximately 97% of our stores open across the globe, with only a handful of closures in North America and Australia. All of our distribution centers are up and running. The average productivity of our reopened store is approximately 75% of last year's volume. As we continue to prioritize our people and our guests, we are still limiting capacity and operating on reduced hours in many locations. We believe these restrictions, coupled with our relatively small store size and high productivity comparisons, continue to impact guest traffic. When looking at new store openings for 2020, we expect to open 30 to 35 net new stores with 15 net new stores opened through the end of Q2. These openings will contribute to a low double-digit increase in square footage for the year. In addition, we are maintaining our seasonal store strategy. We operated just over 50 seasonal stores in Q2 and plan to operate approximately 70 in the second half of the year.  Looking forward, for the business overall, we continue to anticipate the trend in total revenue growth to improve sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. Inclusive of MIRROR in Q3, we expect total revenue to increase in the mid to high single digit range, with Q4 increasing in the high single to low double-digit range. It's important to note that our view on total revenue growth in the back half assumes no improvement to the 75% productivity levels we're currently experiencing in reopened stores. In our digital channel, we expect revenue to remain strong and well above our pre-COVID growth rates of 30% to 40%, but moderate in the second half relative to Q2 with the majority of stores open. And finally, we are now assuming that MIRROR will generate in excess of $150 million in revenue for the full year 2020, up from our initial expectation, which was revenue in excess of $100 million.  We made the strategic decision to increase marketing spend for MIRROR in the second half to take advantage of current trends towards sweating from home and capitalize on the opportunity to drive business during the holiday season and into next year. The increased marketing spend, which will help acquire new guests in the near term and should also produce a return over the longer term through increased product and brand awareness, will contribute to modest earnings dilution reflected in our outlook.  For gross margin, we continue to expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half with the decline relative to last year in Q3, followed by flat to modestly up gross margin in Q4. We remain on track to deliver savings of $40 million in non-merchandise expenses included within gross margin relative to our original budget.  In terms of SG&A for the full year, we expect deleverage to continue in the back half as we prudently invest in select growth initiatives, particularly digital and store traffic likely remains below last year's levels. In addition, while MIRROR'S dilution on our P&L will be modest for the year overall, the bulk of this will be realized within SG&A, contributing to deleverage in Q3 and Q4. We remain on track to realize $130 million in gross SG&A savings by the end of the year relative to our original budget.  With regard to earnings per share compared to a year ago, if we look at just the lululemon business, we expect an adjusted EPS decline in the 10% to 15% range in Q3 and adjusted EPS to grow modestly in Q4. When looking at our combined results for lululemon and MIRROR, we expect an adjusted EPS decline in the 15% to 20% range in Q3 and a modest decline in Q4. For the full year 2020, excluding acquisition costs, we continue to expect MIRROR to be modestly dilutive at less than 5%.  In terms of capital spending, we expect CapEx for 2020 to be below our original budget and generally in line with last year. We are prioritizing spending on digital and omni initiatives and fulfillment capabilities while pulling back somewhat on new store openings and remodels.  Before handing it back to Calvin, I'd like to reiterate that we are cautiously optimistic with regard to the holiday season, and we continue to plan the business based on multiple performance scenarios. Our guidance assumes store productivity remains consistent with the levels we've seen recently and we experience ongoing strength in our e-commerce business. Longer term, we remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan, and we're excited with the opportunities that remain in front of us.  And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan, and I want to take this moment to also thank all of the lululemon employees around the world who continue to be agile, nimble and creative as we meet and exceed the expectations of our guests during this time. I'm proud of the resiliency and flexibility of the business that allows us to deliver results like these that demonstrates both our near-term and long-term strength. And I continue to be impressed by how our leadership team is showing up, both as they lead their teams and strategically co-create our future. We all feel that lululemon is becoming stronger quarter-by-quarter and it's a testament to our people, our ability to innovate and our enduring connection with our guests we love to serve.  We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator, we can now open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about managing any holiday volume challenges, whether store capacity constraints or higher shipping costs? It sounds like you'll be opening some seasonal stores to help with that. Are there any other plans in place to try to ensure that you can successfully manage through this tough 4Q environment? Calvin McDonald : Lorraine, it's Calvin. Absolutely. I'd break it into a couple of key strategic buckets that we've been working on. Early on, the first was pulling forward our investments to ensure that the infrastructure, both our supply chain as well as our websites around the world, were ready for the type of volume that we're anticipating. We've run a variety of scenarios. If you think, obviously, fourth quarter volume is the highest volume within a year, and we're seeing exponential growth on e-commerce. So we sort of applied that modeling to the back half as sort of the benchmark of what we needed to prepare for. And we pulled those investments forward to ensure readiness on the sites and the infrastructure in order to support. And then we've been investing into the guest experience, call center being one of the key areas, looking at how we can mobilize our educators to not just be able to work in the physical, but as well as being able to service our guests online, both through a concierge service as well as a call center. So leaning in and ensuring that we have the infrastructure to support and the guest education center to support are 2 of the big important factors, and that's anticipating our online volume.  In the physical space, there is a variety of initiatives that we keep innovating to take away the operating constraints. That's the reality of operating through COVID. We've all seen the lines at our stores. We know that guests are willing and are waiting to queue up. And our challenge is, how do we get more into the store and transact at a quicker rate. So a variety of innovations have gone into that from the virtual lineups that I shared as well as how we just check guests out and service them outside of the store. And then the seasonal stores is a big shift as well, tapping into our nimble fleet, where last year, in fourth quarter, we had 51 seasonal stores. This year, we're planning on 70. And in some locations, we may even be doubling up in a mall or a location where we have an existing store so we can pick up some of that overflow. So those things combined, we feel good that we'll be ready for the volume where we need to be and maximizing the potential of physical space with some of the innovation that I shared with you. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : On the product margin, can you walk through some of the drivers there relative to the strength that you saw in Q1? I guess, specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impact the warehouse sale had on the quarter and whether the plus 180 you saw in the first quarter might be a better indicator of the underlying run rate of the business. Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Mark. It's Meghan. So we were really pleased with the strength we saw in product margin in the quarter. You heard we did do an online warehouse sale, which compressed really with our stores closed, markdown selling into one period. But when we look across the quarter, we saw some really nice strength out of full price selling. We're not going to offer color on product margin specifically as we move into the second half, but we are expecting gross margins in the second half of the year to be better than the first half and expect a decline in Q3, returning to gross margin expansion year-over-year in Q4. Mark Altschwager : That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up. Thanks for all the detail on the productivity trends and digital. Just any further help on what you're seeing quarter-to-date in each of the channels relative to what you saw in the second quarter? Meghan Frank : Yes. So we are tracking relatively in line with the top line color we provided, which is total revenue growth in the mid to high single digit range for the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : It's McClintock but good job trying. Honestly, I wanted to start with just fulfillment capacity. And it's kind of a follow-up to Lorraine's question, but I want to understand the investments that you're making in terms of fulfillment volume, your ability to handle more volume on the customer service, your ability to deal with customer service with these higher, higher levels of volume. Where does that position you longer term? I understand you're getting ready for the fourth quarter, but I want to think 2 years out, 3 years out. Are you building the ability to handle volume 5 years from now, 6 years from now? Or is this because you're growing so fast, you're still trying to just kind of keep up with that and still have some safety room. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. We're definitely well ahead of the volume that we had anticipated, modeled in our 5-year growth plan that we shared last spring. And under the Power of Three and when we looked at doubling our digital business, we are definitely trending ahead of that run rate. So these investments that we're making this year, I would break into a number of factors. One is our distribution capability of both fulfilling stores as well as e-commerce orders, ensuring we have the right safety measures in place to maintain continuity of operating the DCs, which I'm very proud of the work that the team did to date to operate through while maintaining and putting the health and safety of our warehouse distribution employees front and center.  On the website, improving ongoing stability, the ability to take the traffic and convert. And we saw traffic in quarter 2 increase by 91%. Conversion increased by 46%. So these, combined with the volume, are ahead of where we anticipated. And there's just general infrastructure investments you need to make to be able to scale a business like that. Fortunately, we're predominantly cloud-based now, which allows us to more easily expand both in North America and internationally.  Internationally, our total business was up 37%. That's including stores. In the quarter, every region in Europe and APAC and China grew, and we saw significant growth in e-commerce. So we're experiencing it in all markets, and we're investing there in the infrastructure to support that volume. We're definitely going to come out of the year ahead of where we thought we would be in the 5-year plan on a dollar perspective, and we'll continue to invest in as we look forward to the '23 plan and then obviously, our planning beyond that, prioritizing the investments. I mean, the center of our strategy is an omni ecosystem and approach and digital plays a big part of that. We're going to keep investing to ensure that we support the growth of the business and take a long-term view on it. Matthew McClintock : And then just as a follow-up, we started noticing a lot more lululemon instructors on MIRROR. And I was just -- because you talked about starting to integrate the 2 companies a little bit. I wanted to get your thoughts on bringing your ecosystem on MIRROR and how that's impacting local communities? Are you seeing engagement, greater engagement levels in local communities where you have maybe local instructors teaching on MIRROR now? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks. I would say, as we've alluded, it's very early. And we started a partnership with MIRROR over a year ago, last spring. And in fact, through that partnership, we had some of our lululemon ambassadors on the MIRROR platform last fall. And that gave us a lot of test-and-learn opportunities to see how the MIRROR guest was interacting with both that ambassador as well as the interaction of at-home sweat. And that, among with many other metrics, gave us the confidence and led to the excitement about making the acquisition. So we look forward. We are moving forward with the notion of a light integration. We're only going to be selling in 10 to 15 stores this year, selling it on lululemon.com as a means to building awareness. And it really is set up as a test and learn and focus on '21.  And as Meghan shared, even with the light integration, we're anticipating a solid improvement in their forecast shared earlier, revenues in the $150 million. And as we continue to integrate, as we continue to tap into the ambassadors and the community and expand selling into more of our stores, we're excited about that growth opportunity. Center of how we're viewing our strategy moving forward and where we feel it's very unique versus some other players is the omni ecosystem that's going to include both physical and digital sweat. So the lululemon membership is rooted in physical sweat, MIRROR is rooted predominantly in digital sweat, and we see a relationship between the 2 and at the community level. So we will continue to innovate and expand into that with more to share, but that is really the unique point of our strategy and vision. And MIRROR fits into it well and will be a part of the community, both digitally as well as within the physical representation of our ambassadors, our stores and others as we look to drive that business forward. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Calvin, I was wondering if you can talk about product category expansion and the introduction of ongoing innovation and newness for both the back half of this year and then into 2021. And then Meghan, if you can just talk to us about how you've moved through inventory through the -- I think there were 3 channels that you mentioned or strategies last time and how we should think about that at the end of both 3Q and 4Q? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks. In terms of our product expansion, we've shared the 4 key sweat activities that we're focused on as a business : run, train and yoga, with on the move being one of the key categories, and we're sort of taking a unique point of view as our most recent campaign sort of picked up on, which is the notion, life is a sport. And we see a lot of growth just in how we provide head-to-toe options and solutions for the guests in those activities. Equally, we have a number of sweat activities that our loyal guests choose as either their secondary or tertiary sweat options that we equally see opportunity to expand our current assortment. And we're working to do that. We're innovating into that, and we're excited about bringing a little continual newness as well as continuity to these sweat activities for both our men's business as well as our women's business and accessories. So there is a lot of new innovation in the pipeline. We shared the launch of our pant business this quarter with the City Sleek initiative with much more OTM planned for the back half and into next year and into these new sweat categories. So I continue to be incredibly energized about the product pipeline, both the newness as well as the opportunity we have and what we've already declared and then the expansion of new categories that would be completely incremental for us, building business, footwear in the coming years. So I think it's exciting to see the work that Sun and the team is doing in and around product through Science of Feel. And really believe we're early in what we offer in North America and then even more so internationally, so see a long runway of growth with product. Meghan Frank : Great. In terms of inventory, we are pleased with the level of competition coming out of Q2. Our inventory was up 36% year-over-year, which was under our Q1 year-over-year balance. We previously thought end of Q2 would be our high point, and now we expect that will be Q1. So as you know, we did do an online warehouse sale during the quarter, pleased with those results. But again, I'd just point back to, we're also very pleased with our full price sales results. We do expect inventory to moderate in the second half of the year, up 20% to 30% as we move into the third and fourth quarter. And just as, again, a reminder, we do benefit from core being approximately 40% of our assortment. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Nice job in a tough environment. Calvin McDonald : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Just 2 quick questions just back on the inventory. I understand the high point has been passed and it's going to moderate in the back half, but 20% to 30% is still pretty well above your sales growth. I'm just trying to understand your comfort with the inventory you're carrying, if we should be on the lookout for more potential events to clear inventory in the third or fourth quarter? And then any chance you guys could explicitly break out the MIRROR revenue contribution that you're planning in Q3 and Q4? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks. It's Meghan. So I think in terms of inventory, what I'd say is, again, just 40% of our assortment is -- approximately 40% is core. And we expect inventory levels to moderate through the second half of the year, as we mentioned, 20% to 30%. As you know, that is above sales growth, but we feel comfortable with the level based on redeploying the inventory and taking into consideration that core portion. We do expect gross margin in the second half of the year to improve relative to the first half. And we expect, again, a decline in Q3 and returning to growth in Q4. And then in terms of MIRROR, we're not going to break down the second half estimate, that $150 million, in excess of $150 million is for the full fiscal 2020. Operator : The next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : I had a question on the e-commerce growth. I was wondering if you could share any more color on the cadence of that growth through the quarter and indeed quarter-to-date. And also whether you might be able to share the composition of e-commerce revenue between existing customers and new to lululemon customers? That would be really helpful. Meghan Frank : Great. So in terms of the e-commerce cadence, we had mentioned that we saw 125% when we were reporting Q1 at the start of the quarter. So we did see a pickup as we moved throughout Q2. And we saw 157% for the quarter. And it was 137% excluding the online warehouse sale. We have seen, as I mentioned, in line with our expectation of that year-over-year growth rate moderating as stores open for the full period of Q3 and into the second half. We do expect e-comm to be above the 30% to 40% growth rate that we experienced prior to COVID. Alexandra Walvis : Great. Very clear. And then one more question from me. You're expanding the loyalty test to another city, in Vancouver. Any incremental color you can share on what you've learned from the loyalty pilot so far and anything that you're tweaking as you move into the subsequent pilot in Vancouver? Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, absolutely. Thanks, Alexandra. First, just to clarify, the added city is Toronto that we're adding. So we're repeating in 3 of the 4 cities, repeating at Edmonton, Chicago and Denver. And we tested in Austin with great results. But we elected to bring in a larger city with Toronto to test and learn. So Toronto is going to be the new market. And what we continue to see and the adjustments we've made, obviously, the essence of the program is rooted in connection and community, with physical being a big part. The team has done a wonderful job shifting to virtual events, be it sweat or speaker series or other tutorials that guests have engaged incredibly well in that really set up a lot of interesting learning as we think forward around the program. And we will moderate as we see studios open and guests being able to physically sweat. But where we've landed is a good balance of physical sweat, combined with access to product and then rooted at the notion of community and connection, $168 for the 1 year, and we go on making it available this week, and we're excited to see the results. And in every test city we've done, we've seen very positive response from the guests, high loyalty and engagement and intent to repeat and it does have a positive impact on their overall purchases of lululemon as well as recruitment of new guests. So from a guest metric standpoint, it's very encouraging. And it's early, and we are taking it through a test-and-learn phased approach. Toronto is going to be a great new addition. COVID has been an interesting balance based on the positioning of the membership program, but I'm very excited about how the guest has continued to engage in it. If anything, it's given us more confidence than not about the potential. And we will test and learn through these markets with plans to continue to look at adding additional markets in the coming year. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Omar Saad : Congratulations on another great quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your international results, kind of compare and contrast versus your core North America market. The China number was pretty impressive. Is that a good -- maybe contrast and compare the patterns you're seeing in those markets online and in stores? Did you see, experience pent-up demand there? Maybe some of the differences you would call out for the kind of consumer behavior patterns you're seeing, the guest behavior patterns you're seeing in North America and Europe as well. It would be great to get that feedback. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Omar. I'll start by just sort of teeing up the North American business. As we've sort of shared, from Q1 to Q2, we're really pleased with the progression we saw in both Canada and the U.S. Stores performed similar in both markets. Predominantly, that's linked to the operating constraints that we had to operate under with small stores that were incredibly productive and we just had challenges being able to match the same productivity numbers as the previous year. And e-commerce, obviously, picked up a large share of that additional demand. And overall, the mix of the business, we're very pleased with, and it was a significant improvement from a Q1 performance.  Internationally, I'll start with China because it continues to just build steam and momentum from Q1 when we had the early closings to when the stores reopened. And we're seeing incredible growth in both our e-commerce number, which was up 136% in China and stores, which are up significant growth as we saw through the quarter and heading into this quarter. They're benefiting from a lot of the domestic travel that's occurring. But from a brand perspective, we've opened up a number of additional doors and they have all performed well ahead of plan. In Tier 2 cities, we continue to see great growth and reaction to the brand. And we're acquiring new guests, and both channels are performing very strong. So very excited about what we continue to see as an inflection in our business in China and the momentum behind it and the growth that it's driving, which is by far the strongest of any market that we're in to date in this quarter.  And though in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific, very positive growth, led in e-commerce. E-commerce number similar to that in North America, which is really exciting for us because it's acquiring a new guest and it's resetting how high is high with our online business and potential as we think about assortment, think about our physical real estate strategy and entering into new markets. So I'm excited overall with the performance of our business internationally and continue to see guest acquisition increase the expansion of the brand, led by China, but very strong in all markets that we're in. Omar Saad : Great. And then a quick follow-up on MIRROR. Why only 10 to 15 stores for the fourth quarter? Are there capacity constraints or you just want to build it slowly? Calvin McDonald : Yes. It's definitely build it slowly and test and learn and be able to go a little bit more aggressive in '21. And we're going to test and learn between the balance of making it available and increasing awareness through dot-com, making it available through stores. They're in a good supply chain perspective now. Their average delivery is 7 to 10 days in terms of inventory flow. Obviously, during early COVID, that number was expanded. They've been able to play catch up, and we're sitting in a good position. But we see this as an exciting position long term. And there's good momentum already in that, and we're going to add to it, but it is really test and learn with a focus on '21. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : We'll try this again. Calvin, on the inflection that you cited for retail and for lulu from here, can you first elaborate on investments for market share that you've accelerated during the crisis? And then also on digital, what's the best way to think about the sustainability of digital channel operating margins relative to the 40%-plus that you've achieved the last several years? Calvin McDonald : Yes. I'll touch on the inflection as well as how we're leaning in and how we're planning to continue to lean in. Clearly, health, wellness and functional apparel and trends in apparel have changed dramatically. And I don't foresee them defaulting back to pre-COVID sort of awareness with the guests. I think health and wellness trends are here to stay. I think that some of the trends we've seen in fashion and what guests are going to expect in apparel and in how they dress and how they want their apparel to perform are here to stay. And both of those benefit our brand and our positioning in a number of ways, predominantly linked to our Power of Three growth strategy around product, omni guest and creating that ecosystem as well as market expansion.  So I'm excited about the potential of growth. And what we do know is, and we've shared this before, is even with the success of our business to date, we have awareness opportunities. We have significant awareness opportunities with men in North America. And in our international markets, awareness and consideration is and remains one of our big exciting opportunities. So we definitely leaned in, in Q3 with digital marketing. Plan to do more of that in the back half and into next year. Part of the success we saw internationally was turning on digital marketing and CRM in a more aggressive way than we've traditionally done in the past and it responded very well. So the teams are going to continue to learn. We're continuing to sort of play with our rollout and what we want and expect from the investments and how we get our brand known and have that awareness metric improve in the coming months and the coming years.  So I just think the world is looking for more of what we have to offer and our opportunity, we know, is that our awareness around offering it is still a big opportunity for us, and we're going to lean in and invest in the back half of this year and into next year to do that. And that's all part of the guidance and margin that Meghan provided. And it's also inclusive. There's no change to our Power of Three 5-year view of the financial model that we shared as well last spring. So it's all incorporated in that, how we chase and lean. But it's an exciting opportunity for us to drive awareness, and we see the opportunity and we are shifting investment to go after it. Matthew Boss : Great. And then just one follow-up. Just on the digital trend in August and early September, is there any driver of the moderation that you cited relative to the second quarter or maybe just any commentary to think about as we try to think through the magnitude at all as we think about the current momentum that you guys carry so far into the third quarter. Meghan Frank : Yes. I wouldn't say there's a driver to the moderation. It's really looking at the omni trend overall, which, again, we see in the mid to high single digit range. And just with the lion's share of the stores open, just not seeing as much of a channel shift trend with our guests being able to access our store fleet. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I am pleased to speak with you today about our performance in the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. I'm incredibly proud of how our teams around the globe have continued to execute on the strategies that underpin our Power of Three growth plan as we navigate this unprecedented year. Joining me on the call today is Celeste Burgoyne, who was recently appointed to serve as our first President and will provide an update on our omni-guest experiences. In addition, Meghan Frank, who was recently promoted to Chief Financial Officer, will speak to our third quarter financials and provide some color on our outlook for the fourth quarter. And Alex Grieve, our VP Controller, will be available for Q&A. On today's call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results and share some highlights with you from our Thanksgiving week. Then I'll give an update on our international business and product innovations, including MIRROR before turning the call over to Celeste and Meghan. Let me begin by providing an overview of our business performance in the third quarter. Total revenue increased 22% to $1.1 billion, driven by a combined comp increase of 18%. The revenue increased across our major regions with growth of 19% in North America and 45% in our international markets. In the store channel, productivity increased to 82% of last year's volume, better than our expectation of 75%. Our e-commerce business remained strong with comps of 93%. In addition, gross margin increased 100 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.16 versus $0.96 last year, significantly ahead of our expectations. I'm also excited that in fiscal Q3, our share performance continued with our strongest quarterly market share gain in recent history. We grew our retailer market share of the U.S. adult active apparel market by 1.4 points over last year, according to the NPD Group's consumer tracking service. In summary, these results demonstrate that our brand is becoming stronger, and I'd like to touch on the 6 key drivers of our performance this quarter. First, many of our loyal female guests are shopping our entire collection, extending beyond bottoms as we continue to innovate our offering across categories, including bras and on-the-move. Second, we continue to deliver a steady pipeline of new products to our guests every month as we leverage our Science of Feel development platform. Third, our teams managed our inventory flows extremely well through the COVID store closures to ensure we had ample inventory to support the increased demand. Fourth, we provided pay protection to our educators to protect their well-being, which ensured we were ready to reopen stores and successfully launch new guest-facing services, such as our virtual waitlist appointment shopping and mobile POS. Fifth, we have been investing in our digital capabilities and enhancing the experience of our e-commerce sites for several years, which enabled us to quickly respond to the accelerated shift to omni this year. And finally, we successfully showed how well lululemon translates and connects with guests across cultures and geographies, with growth in both North America and around the world. These drivers will continue to carry us forward into 2021 and beyond as we work to fuel our momentum. Before providing broad comments by category and channel, I wanted to also touch on our performance over the recent holiday. For the week that included Thanksgiving and Black Friday, we delivered a record-breaking performance in our e-commerce channel, which offset declines in store traffic. Response to our full-price offering was extremely good with many of our classic franchise items such as the Align pant, the defined jacket and the ABC jogger as well as new franchises, including Wunder Train and Invigorate all performing well, and our markdown penetration was relatively in line with last year. There are several large volume weeks ahead for us in the fourth quarter, and we recognize that uncertainties remain due to COVID-19. As we have throughout the year, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios yet the unknowns make forecasting the business more difficult. That being said, we are focused on the levers we control such as pulling forward our holiday messaging and leveraging the key drivers I mentioned a few moments ago that led to our success in the third quarter. We are excited about how the holiday season has begun with continued demand for our product offerings, and we have confidence in our ability to execute during this period. Switching now to international. I'd like to start by mentioning that Andre Maestrini will join lululemon in January to serve as our new EVP International. He will have responsibility for leading and driving growth in our international markets, including China and the broader APAC and EMEA regions. I speak for myself as well as our leaders in the regions when I say I'm thrilled to have Andre as part of the team. He's joining us at an exciting time in our international business, and we remain committed to quadrupling revenues from 2018 levels by 2023. Looking at our international business in the third quarter, I'm especially pleased that total revenue increased 45%. In APAC, business was strong across all major markets and particularly in China, where total revenue increased by more than 100%. This was driven by the performance in both our store and e-commerce channels. Over the last 2 years, we have tripled the number of stores we operate in Mainland China, and I'm thrilled with how our brand is resonating across both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. In Europe, guests continue to actively engage with us online as our store traffic remains below last year's level. e-commerce comps increased by nearly 160%. And for the second quarter in a row, these results more than offset declines in our store channel to drive positive revenue growth in the region. Shifting now to product innovation. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel platform to bring new technical merchandise to our guests. Since the early days of the pandemic, our guests have been demanding technical product that offers comfort and versatility as they spend more time working and sweating from home. Within women's, business was particularly strong as we saw a return to pre-COVID growth rates. In total, women's grew 22% with strength in both tops and bottoms. Within men's, total revenue grew 14%, which represents further improvement from the trends in quarter 1 and quarter 2. I'm excited that we're seeing strength in the bottoms category with our male guests returning to our fixed waistband styles, including ABC and commission while our joggers also continue to perform well. And within accessories, we will continue to lean into our strong performance with opportunities to grow our equipment offerings with new products. As an example, in the coming months, we will launch a 3D yoga mat, one of the first in the world designed with a textured surface to better enable body alignment during your practice. Looking forward, I'm thrilled with our pipeline of innovation. For the holidays, we are offering special edition product in many of our key franchises. And over the course of 2021, you'll see us scaling the Science of Feel to bring more technical innovations across our major categories. As I've said before, we are in the early stages of growth within our product innovation pillar, and we have ample ways to expand our key categories of run, train, yoga and on the move. I'm also happy to share an update on MIRROR. Since the acquisition 5 months ago, we have made steady progress on the integration, and we are pleased with the brand's performance in Q3 and with how the holiday season has begun. We continue to expect MIRROR to generate in excess of $150 million in revenue in 2020. Over the course of the third quarter, we began to leverage the lululemon ecosystem to raise awareness for MIRROR. We launched the dedicated MIRROR U.S. e-comm site, including a hyperlink for guests to complete a purchase transaction, and we have included MIRROR in our e-mail marketing campaigns. Also in November, we created shop-in-shops in 18 of our U.S. locations to test and learn how to refine our in-store selling experience, and we plan to expand this to several hundred stores next year. One of our store managers in Santa Monica described it best. Our guests are blown away by the sleek design and functionality of MIRROR that is as innovative and unique as our own products. We are just at the beginning of our journey with MIRROR, and we are thrilled with the current momentum and excited with what this can mean for next year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Celeste, I want to highlight the launch of our impact agenda in October. This is our first long-term strategy focused on how lululemon will become a more sustainable and equitable business. minimize harm to the environment and accelerate positive change, both inside and outside of our company over time. To help us deliver on these commitments, Stacia Jones joined lululemon this quarter and will lead our work related to inclusion, diversity, equity and action, what we call IDEA. Stacia has extensive experience in this area including having served in the role of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer. I look forward to sharing with you our progress on the impact agenda and IDEA commitments going forward. Let me now turn it over to Celeste to speak to our omni guest experience pillar. Our approach toward guest engagement and our ability to deliver unique experiences across both physical and digital environments is a key competitive advantage for lululemon. Celeste? Celeste Burgoyne : Thank you, Calvin. I'm pleased to be on the call today to speak to our omni-guest experience pillar and to share some details on our third quarter performance, both in our store and our e-commerce channel. Over the past several years, we have shifted our organization to be focused on the omni-guest experience rather than focusing on specific channels. This served us very well in the COVID-19 environment. We know that guest behavior is dynamic, and our goal is to create opportunities in both the physical and the digital worlds that offer compelling experiences. We have leveraged our channels, put the guest at the center of all we do and have enhanced the ways we engage with our guests, whether via a transaction, a personal development session, community connection or on the MIRROR platform. Looking at our store channel, we are bullish on stores as physical retail remains an important part of the lululemon growth story. We continue to be focused on and invest in our in-store experience, our stores, our hubs and our local communities, creating a space for engagement among our guests, educators and ambassadors and allowing us to educate and story tell our product in a powerful way. In addition, we leverage our stores to facilitate our omni capabilities, including BOPIS and ship from store, and they continue to be an important vehicle for new guest acquisition. We remain on track to open 30 to 35 net new stores globally in 2020. In Q3, we had 97% of our stores open. Currently, we are still at approximately 97%, but we've seen a tightening of capacity constraints in several markets due to spikes in COVID-19 While these constraints can lead to lines outside stores during peak shopping times, I'm proud of how we have successfully implemented several strategies to improve the guest experience and reduce wait times. These include : first, the virtual waitlist, so guests no longer need to physically wait in line and can be notified by text when it's their turn to enter the store; second, mobile POS, which allows certain transactions such as returns, exchanges and purchasing gift cards to all occur just outside of the store; third, buy online, pick up in store at door or at curbside, offering flexibility and choice for our guests; fourth, appointment shopping that can be scheduled both before, during and after a store's normal operating hours; and fifth is our digital educator program, which is designed to assist guests who would rather continue engaging with us online. This allows a guest to have a quick online chat or schedule an appointment for a personal or group shopping experience. I'm also excited that we continue to successfully execute our ship-from-store capabilities to leverage our inventory across channels. In fact, we achieved our highest volume ever with ship-from-store orders over the Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday week. I'm so proud of how our educators are embracing and executing these new initiatives and further enhancing the guest experience. Another strategic area for us has been leaning more aggressively into our pop-up store strategy with our largest number of seasonal stores this holiday. In Q3, nearly 70 were operating. And in Q4, we plan to increase that number to approximately 100. We have leveraged pop-up successfully for the last several years to bring our product and community to life in markets where we don't have a year-round physical presence. In addition, this year, we're using pop-ups to help alleviate capacity constraints at high-volume stores in key malls across North America, including centers such as Somerset Collection near Detroit and Shenu Center in Calgary. In total, we have opened 14 pop-ups within close proximity to existing stores, and we're also operating 9 gifting hubs and malls where we already have a mainline location. These temporary locations not only help support an improved guest experience, but they also attract new guests into the brand. Switching now to e-commerce. As Calvin mentioned, sales trends remain robust with total digital comps up 93% in Q3, driven by a healthy mix of new and existing guests. Even with stores being open for a majority of the quarter, we continue to see historically retail-only guests now shopping with us online. In the spring, as we recognize the dramatic behavior shift towards e-commerce, we layered on additional investments in IT infrastructure, fulfillment capabilities and our guest education center, all to ensure we are ready for a spike in traffic over the holiday season. And I'm thrilled that we are seeing these investments paying off. Throughout Q3, we continued to see both traffic and conversion remain strong even as the majority of our stores were open throughout the quarter. The enhancements we're delivering to our guests include increased and improved storytelling and product education, more predictive search and a more seamless checkout. In addition, we recently partnered with Afterpay in North America, which is now live on our site, and we have enabled direct checkout functionality on Instagram and Facebook. These features offer our guests new methods to engage and transact with us, which -- while also helping us acquire new guests. Before handing it over to Meghan to take you through our financials, let me give you a quick update on our membership program. In September, we launched in Toronto and began enrolling members for the second year of the program in Denver, Chicago and Edmonton. We are very pleased with the number of guests who have joined us across these 4 cities as they enjoy a higher level of engagement with lululemon and gain access to a more complete expression of our brands. We remain in test-and-learn mode with membership, and we continue to iterate the program such as the recent expansion of our digital offering. Benefits now include virtual workshops focused on emotional fitness, including a recent session hosted by our global ambassador, Gabby Bernstein, which was attended by over 500 members. We will continue to study the ways guests are engaging with us in our test cities, and we'll use these learnings as we evolve the program going forward. I'm also very excited about the opportunities MIRROR could bring to our membership program. We look forward to sharing more in the future about how we plan to leverage these 2 platforms to bring new experiences to our guests and MIRROR members. In closing, I'd like to thank the entire lululemon family. It truly takes a village -- from our product teams to our e-commerce teams to our technology teams and to so many across the company. We are so grateful for everyone's hard work and dedication. And I would like to especially thank our store, guest education center and distribution center teams, who are on the front lines, providing an amazing guest experience during a challenging year. And with that, I also want to congratulate my colleague, Meghan Frank, on being named to serve as our CFO. I will now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Celeste. Let me first say how happy I am to be here as lululemon's newly appointed CFO. I'm excited to continue to partner with Calvin and our talented senior leadership team to execute on our Power of Three growth plans, and I look forward to keeping you up-to-date on our progress on future earnings calls. Let me now provide you with the details on our Q3 performance. And although we are not offering specific guidance, I will provide some color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted Q3 financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR but exclude $8.5 million of acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect. You can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-Q for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q3, total net revenue increased 22% to $1.1 billion, above our expectations for a mid- to high single-digit increase. In our digital channel, we posted a 93% comp increase on top of a 30% increase last year. In our store channel, we had 97% of our stores open and saw productivity increase to 82% of last year's volume, better than our expectation of 75%. Square footage increased 13% versus last year, driven by the addition of 36 net new stores since Q3 of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 9 net new stores and completed -plan optimizations. In terms of our digital channel, e-comm contributed $478 million of top line or 43% of total revenue. We continue to see notable strength in traffic and conversion. Traffic was driven by channel shift, coupled with investments in digital marketing and conversion continues to benefit from gaps response to our product and the investments we have made in our global digital platforms to improve guest experience. Gross profit for the third quarter was $627 million or 56.1% of net revenue compared to 55.1% of net revenue in Q3 2019. The gross margin increase of 100 basis points was driven by 170 basis points of leverage on occupancy and depreciation and 10 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 80 basis points of deleverage in product margin, primarily due to higher airfreight costs related to COVID-19 and higher markdowns. Moving to SG&A. Our approach in the current environment has been to protect against downside while also ensuring we continue to invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $412 million or 36.8% of net revenue compared to 35.9% of net revenue in Q3 2019. The deleverage in the quarter resulted predominantly from marketing investment associated with MIRROR, partially offset by leverage on higher-than-expected sales. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $213 million or 19.1% of net revenue compared to 19.2% of net revenue in Q3 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $62 million or 28.9% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.1% a year ago. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $151 million or $1.16 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.96 in Q3 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $66 million for the quarter compared to $78 million in the third quarter last year. Q3 spend relates primarily to digital channel and analytics capabilities, supply chain investment, technology spend to support our business growth and store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of total liquidity. We have $482 million of cash and cash equivalents and $700 million of available capacity under our committed revolving credit facilities. However, subsequent to quarter end, and based on the strength of our financial position and our outlook for future cash flows, we've given notice to cancel the $300 million short-term credit facility we put in place at the time of the MIRROR acquisition. We continue to maintain our 5-year revolving credit facility of $400 million, which matures in 2023. Inventory grew 23% versus last year and was $771 million at the end of Q3. We continue to expect levels at the end of Q4 to increase in the 20% to 30% range. As we announced today, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in our share repurchase program from $264 million to $500 million. We've repurchased nearly $1.4 billion of our stock for the last 6 years, and we continue to believe share repurchases are an effective method of returning cash to shareholders. Let me now shift to current trends and share with you some color on how we are looking at the fourth quarter. Due to the dynamic nature of the macro environment, we are not yet returning to our historical cadence of providing specific guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year. We remain focused on leveraging our omni model and digital strength as we navigate the uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. While the majority of our stores remain open, we have continued to see guest shift between channels, which has driven outsized growth on our e-commerce sites. As we've mentioned, we pulled forward investments in our digital channel to ensure our guests continue to receive an elevated experience when shopping our sites and to maximize holiday business. In terms of stores, we currently have approximately 97% of our stores open across the globe, in line with Q3. However, as we're seeing a resurgence of COVID-19 in several markets, We've experienced a higher number of government-mandated capacity restrictions in November and December relative to Q3. Given our historically high levels of productivity, particularly during the holiday season, these constraints clearly limit the number of guests who can enter our stores at any given time. Therefore, when looking at Q4, overall, we are expecting productivity to be approximately 70% of last year's levels, with trends in line with Q3 during nonpeak weeks. When looking at new store openings for 2020, we remain on track to open 30 to 35 net new stores, with 24 net new stores opened through the end of Q3. These openings will contribute to a low double-digit increase in square footage for the year. In addition, we continue to execute on our seasonal store strategy with nearly 70 seasonal stores operating in Q3 and and plans to operate approximately 100 in Q4. Looking at Q4 specifically, we expect total sales to increase in the mid- to high teens. This is above our prior expectation of a high single to low double-digit increase and assumes e-commerce growth remains strong but likely moderate modestly from levels we saw in Q3. This also assumes the majority of our stores remain open throughout the fourth quarter. When looking at MIRROR, we continue to expect revenue for the full year 2020 to be in excess of $150 million with strong results during Thanksgiving week. We're excited with the momentum we're seeing in this business. particularly the growing community of people sweating with MIRROR, which contributes to increased brand awareness and strong long-term financial returns. In terms of gross margin, we continue to believe it will be flat to up modestly versus last year in Q4. When looking at SG&A, we continue to expect deleverage in Q4 as store traffic remains below last year's levels, and we continue to invest in marketing for MIRROR to take advantage of current trends towards sweating from home to drive the long-term value of this business. Given the seasonality of this investment, we expect to deleverage in Q4 to exceed what we experienced in Q3. With regard to Q4 earnings per share, compared to a year ago, the growth rate in adjusted EPS is now expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, up from our prior expectation for a modest decline. This includes operating results from MIRROR but excludes acquisition and integration-related costs. In terms of capital spending, we now expect CapEx for 2020 to come in somewhat below last year's level. Before handing it back to Calvin, I'd like to reiterate that we believe we are well positioned from an omni perspective for the high-volume weeks that remain ahead of us this holiday season. We're excited with the performance we saw over Thanksgiving week, but acknowledge the environment remains uncertain, particularly given COVID-19-related capacity constraints. We have planned for multiple scenarios and we'll continue to be agile as we serve our guests where and when they want to shop. I'd also like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work and for enabling these results we reported today. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. Before we take your questions, I also wanted to mention that this quarter, we were pleased to welcome Courtney Gibson to our Board of Directors. Courtney is President of Loop Capital Markets, one of the largest privately held investment banking, brokerage and advisory firms headquartered in the United States. She brings a wealth of consumer and market insights to lululemon, and I look forward to her counsel. Let me close by reiterating that we are positioned well for the big volume days during the holiday season. Since the early days of COVID-19, our management team has been preparing for multiple possible scenarios, and we are ready to serve our guests where and when they want to connect with us. In our store channel, we will leverage our seasonal stores, virtual waitlist, mobile point-of-sale and appointment shopping to ease capacity constraints and continue to protect the safety of our store teams. And in e-commerce, our investments are paying off as our sites have demonstrated the ability to more than handle the anticipated spike in volume. In closing, I want to once again thank our teams around the world for continuing to be there for our guests and for one another. Their resilience, tenacity and creativity throughout 2020 have been a continued source of inspiration for me and our entire leadership team. This sets us up well for the coming months and quarters ahead. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Congrats on the strong results here. Really nice to see the digital momentum. I was hoping you could talk about e-commerce capacity in Q4 and really your ability to sustain the type of growth rates you've been seeing given the much higher sales base in the fourth quarter. And then separately, I just wanted to touch on men's. I think the growth rate there has lagged the overall company year-to-date. I was hoping you could dig into the drivers there a bit more. Is it a function of just the work-from-home and lower demand for some of the core products like ABC or just any other high-level learnings there and how you see the men's business potentially reaccelerating from here? Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks, Mark. It's Meghan. I'll take the e-comm capacity and then hand it over to Calvin for men's. So as we mentioned, we have been planning for multiple scenarios for Q4, and we feel well positioned to capture e-comm opportunity, depending on where the guest wants to shop with us. And we do see it moderating slightly from what we experienced in Q3 just in line with our overall guidance of mid- to high-teens growth relative to our 22% increase in Q3. Calvin McDonald : Great. And on men's, Mark, we're really happy with the progression we've seen through Q1, Q2 through to Q3. Moving from Q2 to Q3, the men's business accelerated almost at the same rate as women's. So although it's slightly behind our women's growth, it has, in fact, accelerated faster from the Q1 impact from COVID. And it's predominantly driven by he just wasn't shopping to the same degree out of the gate as she was. And that's in the market. We continue to put on share with our men's business. We've seen him respond well to strengthen our shorts, our sweats and our hoodies. And we have seen in Q3, our fixed waistband business getting much stronger. So I'm very pleased with the acceleration of the men's business, his response to the product and see no concern. And we remain committed to our power of doubling our men's business by '23. Mark Altschwager : That's great. And maybe, Calvin, just a quick bigger picture one. Just thinking ahead to next year, vaccine is on the way, but probably some time before we return to normal buying patterns. Could you just speak to how you're planning the business in terms of inventory flows, maybe pace of product introductions, anything on the marketing front as we head into spring of 2021. Calvin McDonald : Yes. In terms of -- as we look through multiple scenarios into next year, we talked earlier about our inventory position coming out of Q1 and where we are coming out of Q3. And we continue to feel very good about our position, up 23%, down from 41% in Q1. We have the product to satisfy the demand, and our product is predominantly core, less seasonal. So we're well positioned, and we've continued to lean in to make sure that we have the product to satisfy the demand. Our newness and innovation pipelines remain healthy, very strong, and we haven't pulled back on any of those. And that will continue to hit and flow. So we feel very good, and we're excited about the opportunity with new guests entering this category. The new guests that we've acquired through 2020 continue to build upon that and look the ways to amplify the brand. So again, not knowing the next few months, we feel very good about our position, the flow of product, our guest engagement, our ability to continue to fuel the business and growth forward. Mark Altschwager : That's great. Best of luck, and congrats, Meghan, on the new role. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : I guess, first, just a clarification for Meghan. On the productivity in the fourth quarter stepping down to 70% in store, what is all being taken account to here? Is it just what you're seeing currently or just your anticipation of further capacity constraints to come? And then Calvin, as we just think about the product road map into next year, any update on footwear and any other kind of key product innovation, things we should be mindful of? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Erinn. I'll start on productivity. So we did see average productivity in our stores in Q3 at 82%, which was higher than our expectation of 75%. But given we are seeing a resurgence with COVID-19 in some markets and we are also seeing stricter capacity constraints, government-mandated capacity constraints in several markets as we head into these peak weeks, we are expecting productivity overall for the quarter to be at approximately 70%, but reaching trends in line with Q3 during non-peak weeks. And it's really driven by just the volume of store sales in Q4. In a typical year, we see a 40% to 50% lift from Q3 to Q4, which given capacity constraints and traffic impact clearly limits our opportunity to service that traffic in our stores. . Calvin McDonald : And on our product pipeline, I'll first touch on footwear. So we anticipate the back half of next year introducing the -- our introduction into the category with selling in early '22. So we're excited to share our unique point of view and innovation in that category. And as it relates to all others, the pipeline is full, and we will continue through what we've expressed before of OTM, the sizing expansion. But as we continue to invest in our activity base, be it run, train or yoga, across the categories, there's a number of innovations that we'll introduce throughout the year that will continue to fuel growth in the business. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I'd like to follow up on your comments around the air freight pressure in 3Q. Do you expect this to persist? And then can you also comment on the availability of air freight capacity just to make sure that you can land enough inventory to meet holiday demand and then into the early spring? Meghan Frank : Sure, Lorraine. It's Meghan. So we have seen higher air freight market rates, but generally sufficient availability. We do expect that we'll continue to have some air freight rate pressure in Q4, and that is reflected in the guidance that we provided of a modest increase in Q4. Lorraine Maikis : Have you found enough capacity to meet demand? Meghan Frank : I'm sorry. I think I missed the second part of that question. Can you repeat that? Lorraine Maikis : Sure. Have you been able to find enough capacity to meet demand for the holiday and then into the early spring launches? Meghan Frank : Yes. Yes. We don't have any capacity limitations at this point. Operator : The next question comes from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matthew McClintock : Congrats both Celeste and Meghan and even Courtney. I guess there is some good news in 2020. The question I have, actually, Calvin, and it's a little bit different angle than what Mark went with. But you -- your women's business still seems to be growing pretty exceptionally And there's a lot of people out there that think that you're ultimately going to need men's to grow fast at some point. But your women's business has proven that it can consistently grow faster than anyone's ever thought for years. So you actually put up a nice slide back at that Investor Day a couple of years ago. I'm talking about TAM, total addressable market. So how have your thoughts on the total addressable market changed or evolved now that we're in a COVID world or a post-COVID world? That's my first question. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. I mean it's definitely with the inflections that we've seen this year through COVID with guests living a more active, healthy life and looking for more versatility in their apparel clothing, I think that all bodes well for the addressable market that we shared at the time. And what we shared at the time was we are early innings of our share of that addressable market. So I do think there are 2 forces. We will continue to gain share the addressable market, as we did in this quarter, and we shared achieving among our largest gains in our recent history. So that said, even with guests coming in and looking for versatility, we are winning at a greater rate than others. And I do believe that addressable market will only get larger. So I think both will continue to add fuel for our business. And we're happy with our men's business and the acceleration and the growth moving forward. We know that's a big opportunity for us as a percent of share of sales as well as just awareness. And as you've indicated, our women's business is far from -- at its potential. And what we saw this quarter was new guests coming in and our existing guests broadening out from some of the core categories as we've introduced newness, as we also innovate behind those. We introduced the cloud bra. Bras has been a big opportunity for us that we see with our female guests, and they responded incredibly well -- responded and the total category lifted. And we saw a really strong share growth. So I'm excited about the continual growth in women's both through new guests as well as migrating them into new categories, fueled by our innovation, fueled by versatility of apparel, the growth of TAM and our market share potential. Matthew McClintock : But just as a follow-up question. On MIRROR specifically, you meaningfully increased your guidance for MIRROR last quarter. I think 50%, $100 million to $150 million plus this year, and yet you kept the earnings the same, the accretion dilution, the same in terms of guidance. And you said that was going to go into marketing. So I'm just actually curious, can you give us an update in terms of the returns that you're seeing on the marketing dollars that you're actually putting to work at MIRROR? Calvin McDonald : Absolutely. We're really pleased with the holiday that MIRROR is having. We guided and raised it in the last earnings call, and we've reinforced the - in excess to that number. We're off to a very good holiday with MIRROR through November. There's lots of content and experiential innovation that's rolling out that we're announcing, for example, sweat dates, which is very unique and differentiated on the platform. We've only started rolling it out within the lululemon network. We have 18 stores today that we're learning and is becoming a great beacon and brand building opportunity and rolling it into other lululemon channels, with plans next year of going to hundreds of stores, continuing to build upon the platform. And there are some big weeks ahead. So I like our position. I like where we are in the quarter, and there is very solid momentum behind it. And we bet with the team on inventory numbers that allow us to have units. So we're in a good stock position with 2-week SLAs. So I'm encouraged. And there are some big weeks ahead with some uncertainty. But all indication is very positive with guest response and the momentum that's fueling and building behind MIRROR. Matthew McClintock : I actually look forward to using -- wearing my lululemon shoes that Erinn Murphy talked about with MIRROR. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious, you mentioned stores operating at around down 18%. I just want to make sure I understand if that number is being hurt more by weaker traffic or not being able to handle the traffic that is showing up, just given the smaller store size. And I think maybe related to that, you've got these pop-up stores. I just want to make sure I understand the accounting of those sales. Are those -- is that going to be included in comps if they are near to an existing store? And just how does that tie in to the spread that we see between comps and total sales as we look to 4Q? Meghan Frank : So I would say in terms of store traffic, there are lower industry trends. And I think generally speaking, more traffic is shifting to e-comm. I think that said, we do have capacity constraints, and that's impacting also our ability to put traffic to our stores. As you mentioned, we are opening approximately 100 seasonal locations that will have an operation through Q4. Those do not show up in our comp sales. They will show up on our other channels. And as you mentioned, some of those are within markets and centers where we have existing locations so that we can capitalize on that traffic flow through Q4. . Operator : The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : My congratulations as well on the quarter and the new roles by Celeste, Meghan, Stacia and Courtney. My question is on e-commerce. You continue to experience, obviously, really strong growth in that channel with over 40% of sales this period. While that likely changes when the environment normalizes, just how has your view on investing in and rolling out stores changed, if at all? And are there areas of capabilities online where you need to invest further? And just lastly on that, how does a higher e-commerce mix kind of impact the P&L over the long term? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Paul. I'll talk to the -- our current strategic thinking through the balance of the channels and then hand it off to Meghan to talk about mix. We are obviously incredibly excited about the omni guest that has joined lululemon this year. Equally, the stores will remain a very important strategy and presence within how we service our guests, how we recruit and acquire new guests. There's been no dramatic change to our forward view of that. We always open a conservative number of new stores on an annual basis. They are small, highly productive and have the role of more than just transacting. They are building in the community, connecting to our guests and our ambassador community and really being a marketing driver, while at the same point, servicing and selling at high productivity. And we are early in the size of our store network. So we're going to continue to be opportunistic. I think there's going to be exciting opportunities for us next year with the state of retail. And our balance of cities, our balance of mall to non-mall is healthy, and our fleet remains healthy, and we will continue to take that conservative opportunistic view. And then with digital, we did a lot of innovation this year that the team will just build upon. You can go to the site today, you can interact with one of our incredible store educators live on demand through video. You can schedule a concierge, not to mention that traditional omni connectivity of buying online, picking up in store. So we're going to continue to invest in that digital connection of the ecosystem, both on how the guest transacts but also bring to our digital the human connection that is so unique within our store environment. So we're excited about our innovation and continue to feel the success in both channels, both which play a key critical role in our omni strategy. And Meghan, if you want to talk about mix? Meghan Frank : Yes. So in terms of e-comm penetration impact on operating margin, we do, as you noted, see a higher operating margin in that channel. However, stores, which have historically been approximately 70% of our mix have seen decline in traffic and revenue. So that's contributed to some deleverage and impacted the overall profitability in the near term. As we look into the future, we do aim to manage the business on an omni basis and remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan, which includes operating margin slightly above revenue growth over the long term. And as we mentioned, we've been planning into multiple scenarios, and that channel penetration dynamic is an important piece of that. Paul Trussell : You mentioned the loyalty program earlier. Can you just provide any additional details on spend per shopper enrolled in the program versus others? Any further color on rollout plans to additional cities and just any tweaks or changes you've made to the program of late? Celeste Burgoyne : Yes. Thanks, Matt. It's Celeste. I'll take that question. So obviously, as I mentioned, we're operating currently in 4 cities across North America with our membership program. And we are really pleased with not only the number of guest but also the engagement of guests. So we are not going to talk about any specifics on spend or any of that stuff, but really happy overall with their engagement. We did have a really great event in October. We had Gabby Bernstein, one of our global ambassadors who led an hour-long wellness and mental well-being session. We had over 500 members from across those 4 cities joined. So just an example of how we're really leveraging this program, and our guests are really enjoying participating and connecting with us across our entire ecosystem and really through the entire Sweatlife. We're really using these markets in these cities to continue to test and iterate. Obviously, a pivot to digital during this current environment has been a huge area of pivot. But one of the things that we're really excited about is also the opportunities that MIRROR can bring to our membership program. So we'll have more to share on that in the future. But definitely, the teams are hard at work ensuring that we really create and continue to iterate this program. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another nice quarter. So Calvin, could you elaborate on comp trends that you've seen since the close of the third quarter. Black Friday, I think you said record weeks sounds great. Have you seen overall comps accelerate relative to high-teens performance in the third quarter? And has store performance to date exceeded the embedded 70% full quarter forecast? Meghan Frank : Matt, it's Meghan. I'll take that. So we were pleased with the performance we saw during Thanksgiving week, and we did intentionally pull forward some seasonal activity, just given the capacity constraints as we moved further into the quarter. And we remain comfortable with the level of guidance we gave for Q4. That said, there is some uncertainty ahead of us, both with the virus and impact on store closures as well as store trends and guest behavior. So that's why our outlook for the balance of the quarter is a little lower than what we've seen to date. . Matthew Boss : Okay. Great. And then just maybe for SG&A. On the accelerated e-commerce investments that I believe are tied to the higher digital penetration that you're seeing. Is this spending -- or is this basically incremental dollars relative to the 5-year plan laid out at your Analyst Day? Or should we think about this as more of a pull forward of some of the multiyear expenses and investments that were already preplanned within that 5-year plan? Meghan Frank : I would think about it as more of a pull forward. And as I mentioned, we'll look -- we look to manage the business from an omni perspective. And as e-comm has accelerated, we've also somewhat pulled back on store openings, and so we'll look to balance our portfolio over the longer term as well. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Let me add my congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe I'll just dovetail off Matt's question. Could you talk about how the SG&A in the fourth quarter, maybe what the book ends at the different range of the scenarios you planned? Or what were some of the -- what are some of the big swing factors between the high end and the low end of the scenarios you're thinking about in the quarter? And then I guess, looking out to next year, Calvin, how would you stratify -- I guess, with what you've learned this year and how your customers changed, how would you stratify what you think are the incremental growth drivers to lean into? And I guess, referencing Matt's question, as you think about investing coming off this, given that the growth next year pivots back to stores, that's where you have the majority of your fixed cost and leverage, is there a scenario where the SG&A could grow faster than revenues next year to get back on track to that 5-year plan? Meghan Frank : So I'll take the first part of your question. So in terms of SG&A, we're not providing specific guidance for Q4. But as I mentioned, we do expect Q4 to deleverage slightly more than what we experienced in Q3. And we do -- we do plan the business prudently and manage costs effectively as we move through the fourth quarter. That really is driven by 2 pieces that deleverage. So the first would be due to this pressure on store traffic remaining below last year's levels and the impact that has on the P&L. And the second piece would be our investment in MIRROR. So as we mentioned, we see MIRROR as being modestly dilutive to earnings in 2020. The majority of that dilution will impact Q3 and Q4 given the seasonality of the business and the investment that we've been discussing in terms of marketing to capture new guests with the benefit really coming over the long term in that business. Calvin McDonald : And I'll just add, in terms of the multiple scenarios, we've looked at, there are a number of growth drivers that we anticipate will continue and accelerate from '20 into '21. As I mentioned, we're excited about the growth in women's, the growth coming from not just a strong bottoms business, but an acceleration in the additional adjacent categories. And those categories are ones in which the team has been working on, newness and innovation for the past few years in bras, in tops for example, in OTM. And next year, the innovation and the addition into those categories continues as we also continue to launch newness into our bottoms business. So I see a continual growth in the women's business. Men's is showing the pace in which it's reaccelerating, and I anticipate next year that it will be back at its momentum coming into '20 as we resume to some degree of normalcy. The international business incredibly strong. We've learned so much this year about the power of e-commerce. And I think that will continue to allow us to drive our omni initiatives across many markets into next year. And I'll just end with guest. We've acquired a number of exciting guests through COVID this year. One that came to us through e-commerce and haven't shopped our physical store because of a variety of constraints and the ability to migrate them into the store and have them become an omni guest. And then the increase in our omni guest portfolio within our existing a store-only guests became omni and shopped with us online and how we leverage those opportunities and continue to drive the share of spend with us going into next year. So multiple scenarios but all very positive on the back of product and the innovation that we're launching heading into next year. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the performance and everybody on their promotions. Well-earned. Calvin, I guess my first question for you is, traditionally, showrooms and brand strength itself has been the driving force of advertising. Wondering as you become a global brand with a huge little footprint, what's your philosophy on investing more in demand creation? And then Meghan, for you, what have you learned about attachment rate of product purchases in combination with MIRROR sales? And what portion of the MIRROR customer file overlaps with that of lulu? Calvin McDonald : I believe we have an exciting opportunity with our brand to drive awareness to, therefore, drive consideration and help fuel guest acquisition and add to the growth potential that lululemon has. We talk a lot about the unaided awareness within men's and the opportunity to recruit more men to drive the awareness behind the brand and recruit. But that also exists for women. And it exists even in our more mature markets like the U.S. and Canada, not to mention international. So as you know, Nicky Neuberger joined us in the new role of Chief Brand Officer earlier this year, and she has already made an impact in assembling the talent of that team. And I'm excited how we're positioned heading into next year to drive into some of those initiatives and opportunities. We see a huge opportunity around earned media, and doing more with that as well as just the current initiatives we deploy to drive awareness and recruit. So you'll definitely see in '21 an increased effort and tactics of how we go within North America, but also internationally to tackle some of the opportunities we have with the brand and driving awareness and consideration. Meghan Frank : And in terms of MIRROR and overlap with lululemon, I'd say we're still very early in our integration with 18 stores open and learning a lot there. But what we did see in diligence was approximately a 50% overlap. So we do believe that the brands are very compatible, and we're excited about what we can create in the future. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

In addition, the comparable sales and store productivity metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the fourth quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Howard. I'm excited to be with you today. I'm proud of how lululemon navigated this past year and delivered for our employees, guests and shareholders. I believe 2020 has been a pinnacle moment for lululemon as we developed and delivered exciting new innovations that create even more opportunities for us into the future. Our continued growth demonstrates our ability to win, both before, during and after COVID-19. Our business has many strengths and growth opportunities. We are just in the early innings of our potential. In fact, the pandemic has accelerated our progress and the opportunities we have within each of our Power of Three growth initiatives. Over the course of today's call, we'll discuss our strong performance in the fourth quarter and the full year, and we'll also share our road map for 2021. I'm pleased to be joined on the call today by Sun Choe, our Chief Product Officer, who will provide an update on our product innovations; Meghan Frank, our Chief Financial Officer, who will speak to our fourth quarter financials and offer our guidance outlook for quarter 1 and the fiscal year of 2021; and Alex Grieve, our Controller, will also be available to answer any questions that you may have during the Q&A portion of the call. Let me start now by looking at 2020. Last year was another good reminder of the strength of our core product assortment. Even as guest apparel needs evolve throughout the year, our positioning around technical athletic product remained extremely relevant. People will always want to sweat and stay active, and our focus on innovative performance fabrics will continue to deliver unique solutions. We continue to execute against our growth plans, culminating with several notable wins in the fourth quarter. Meghan will share the financial metrics with you, but I wanted to give you a couple of highlights. Starting with our e-commerce performance, which grew 92% on top of 41% growth in the previous year. We grew our women's business by nearly 20%, fueled by strong performance across all categories. And our international revenues grew 47% with growth across all regions, indicating just how well our brand translates across cultures and geographies. When looking at the full year, a few accomplishments really stand out for me. We grew total revenue by 11% in 2020 and with our second half growth accelerating to 23%, in the full year, we more than doubled our e-commerce business. We continue to bring product innovation to our guests, including a relaunch of our Everlux fabric, our recent launch of DrySense as well as further strengthening our assortment in our key activities of run, train and yoga. The guest response was very strong across all these product initiatives, and we'll continue to strengthen our pipeline of innovation in 2021 and beyond. We gained market share over the course of the fiscal year, as indicated by our nearly 1 point gain in retailer market share of the adult activewear market in the U.S. according to the NPD Group consumer tracking service. This was our largest annual share gain in recent history and was driven by gains in both men's and women's. We led powerfully through COVID-19, providing pay protection to our employees, creating our ambassador relief fund and honoring our financial commitments to both landlords and vendors. We successfully completed the MIRROR acquisition. We accelerated our work related to inclusion, diversity and equity. We released our first Impact Agenda, which details our goals related to how we will create positive change to support people, create access to well-being and our sustainability initiatives. And we achieved all of this and strengthened our financial position, ending the year with $1.2 billion of cash. When looking back at 2020, the fundamental drivers of our performance have been the same for the past 3 years, and the pandemic has only accelerated their importance in the lives of our guests. In addition, the trends that existed before the pandemic are even more important now and will only continue to grow post the pandemic. For example, people wanting to live an active and healthy lifestyle, combined with the growth in demand for technical athletic apparel that performs, and finally, the innate need to feel part of a community and to share a human connection with one another. Even with these growing trends, you might have expected our on-the-move and casual products to have had a compelling impact on our success in 2020. However, that was not the case. In fact, our product design for performance represented approximately 67% of our total merchandise mix last year, which was a 4 point increase in penetration from the previous year. We keep creating unique and differentiated product solutions for our guests and their evolving needs. This success in developing technical innovation is guided by our proprietary Science of Feel platform. Consumer and health trends are only increasing, and we are in the early innings of our growth potential across channels, across regions, across genders and across activities. So let's look at the year ahead. The foundational strategies of our Power of Three growth plan remain unchanged and continue to drive the innovation across the business. I'll now touch on our plans for stores, e-commerce, product, international and MIRROR. Our stores and the physical connection they provide to our guests remain incredibly important to us and are an integral part of our omnivision. In 2021, we'll be implementing a number of exciting initiatives, starting with the initiative to kickstart our stores. As operating constraints are removed, our teams are focused on accelerating our store productivity. We have a number of guests that only shop our stores, and we are focused on reengaging with them at the frequency they shopped with us before COVID-19. In addition, we have a significant number of new guests who engaged with us for the first time online last year. We are focused on extending our omni-relationship with them so they can more fully experience the brand and community connection our stores offer. We will also be expanding our store base. We continue to be underpenetrated from a brick-and-mortar perspective across all our markets, including North America and around the world. We benefit considerably from the agile retail formats. And in 2021, we will fully leverage this strength, opening 40 to 50 new mainline lululemon locations globally. And finally, we will continue to enhance our omni-capabilities. I'm excited to build upon the success of these new strategies we've rolled out towards the end of last year, including curbside pickup, virtual waitlist and the appointment shopping. These became guest favorites that elevated our in-store experience and demonstrated an area of opportunity going forward. I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter as Celeste Burgoyne and her team demonstrate the power of our stores. 2020 was an outstanding year for our e-commerce business as guest behavior accelerated. As a result, we are now able to reevaluate how high is high for our digital growth, especially in our international markets. 2020 has reset our expectations for what is possible. For example, our digital comps more than doubled for the full year and grew 92% in the fourth quarter, driven by a healthy combination of increases in traffic and conversion. These results were significantly ahead of our initial expectations and enabled us to achieve, 3 years early, our 2023 goal of doubling our e-commerce revenue from 2018 levels. We now have a very meaningful e-commerce business that is driving both new guest acquisition as well as strengthening our omni-guest relationships. Our channel investments will continue to focus on elevating the guest experience and further strengthening our foundation while we also test and learn new capabilities. The relationship we have with our guests in-store is unique and special for our brand. And our e-commerce vision is to create our online version of that relationship as well. Specifically, in 2021, our key e-commerce strategies are to elevate the guest experience by introducing more immersive category and franchise shops, investing in our product details page and enhancing our storytelling to bring the Science of Feel to life with new types of content and creative. We will continue to drive conversion by continuing to optimize the guest experience with further enhancements to search, browse, checkout, personalization and payment methods. We will accelerate our investments into the strength of our international business as we expand our omni-capabilities and localize the guest experience through local payment and delivery options. And we will keep investing to scale our foundation and enhance the guest experience by evolving our BOPUS and curb pickup capabilities, piloting same-day delivery from our stores in 9 key markets and refining and scaling our digital educator program. Turning now to product. I couldn't be more excited with the pipeline and innovation the teams have untapped for 2021 and beyond. As I mentioned, we launched several new items last year : a combination of new fabrics, additional offerings in our key activities as well as ongoing enhancements to our core assortments. What's exciting about our product launch strategies is that they are bigger than just any single item. These launches, whether new franchise opportunities or strengthening our position within our key activities, provide significant future growth opportunities that we will keep innovating on. Building upon this momentum, in 2021, we will continue to leverage the Science of Feel platform to bring new technical solves across our assortments for both men and women. We are launching our Dual-Gender Run campaign this week. We're also introducing new tops within Train and On The Move. We are further expanding our core franchises, including Align and we are building towards the early 2022 launch of our technical footwear, which will allow us to provide guests with head-to-toe solutions. We expect another strong year of growth in 2021, with exciting launches planned across men's, women's, key categories and activities, all driven through innovation. We will have more to share with you as the year proceeds, and Sun will speak to you further in just a moment. I would now like to shift to our business outside of North America. In 2020, our international revenues grew 31%, and we remain on track to quadruple the business from 2018 levels in 2023. At only 14% penetration, we are in the very early days of our journey outside of North America. The growth is incredibly strong and we are showing how well our brand translates across cultures and geographies. Our key 2021 strategies include organizing into 3 regions, led by our new EVP of International, Andre Maestrini. The regions, EMEA, Asia Pacific and China, each have respected regional leaders with clear accountability and responsibility for driving distinct growth plans. In EMEA, this includes building upon the strong online growth in 2020 as well as leaning into key markets such as Germany and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, the opportunities include growing in critical markets such as Korea and Japan and in our long-established market of Australia and New Zealand. And in China, we will open our largest number of new stores this year, with the goal of adding 15 to 20 stores across both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in the mainland. The health and wellness trend is growing in this market, yet remains nascent. So there are considerable opportunities ahead for us. And on a regional basis, similar to how we currently operate in North America, we'll have a singular view of inventory by the end of the year. Not only will this enable us to leverage inventory across channels, but it will pave the way for the implementation of transactional omni-capabilities, starting with ship-from-store in the U.K. and Australia by the end of the year. I look forward to having Andre join us on some upcoming calls. I will now turn to the newest member of the family, MIRROR. We are very pleased with the performance of MIRROR in quarter 4 and over the course of the entire year as well. MIRROR generated approximately $170 million in revenue in 2020, including the period prior to our acquisition. I'm excited about the long-term outlook for the at-home sweat industry. We started the process to purchase MIRROR before the global pandemic began because we believe in the opportunity to strengthen our community, further connect with our guests in their homes and provide new solutions for their workout needs. I don't expect the pandemic tailwinds to disappear once mass vaccinations have occurred. Guests were seeking more convenient at-home options before COVID-19, and they will continue to seek these options post the pandemic. And simply put, MIRROR is the most versatile at-home fitness platform available on the market today. We offer more live classes across more workouts than any other product. And our guests are responding with more than 2 users per household and the average member taking over 6 different types of workouts each month. This versatility drives frequent engagement and truly positions MIRROR as having something for everyone within every household. This unique position will continue to translate into meaningful growth as we strengthen our member relations, further engage with our community and drive financial performance. And we plan to continue to invest further into this advantage by adding even more live classes across more workout options while also investing in the overall guest experience in building this powerful community. I would like now to share some of our key 2021 MIRROR strategies, starting with studios. We are adding 2 more production studios so that by the end of the year, we will have 3 studios allowing us to triple the number of live classes compared to our current offering. We now have 15 instructors on MIRROR with plans to add up to 7 more across multiple workout activities and all instructors are lululemon ambassadors. We'll continue to launch community engagement initiatives. We recently added the Community Camera feature, allowing members and instructors to see each other during the workout. This month, we added the Face-off feature, which allows 2 members to compete head-to-head during the class. We are kicking off our international expansion plans, starting with Canada, launching in time for the holiday period this year. And we will continue to leverage the lululemon ecosystem to raise awareness for MIRROR which remains one of our biggest opportunities. We will expand our shop-in-shop strategy to more than 200 locations in North America this year. We have many more exciting guest-facing innovations plan that we'll share throughout the year. Brin Putnam and her team at MIRROR continue to drive these exciting results and initiatives. I'm very pleased with the performance of MIRROR, a business that launched only 3 years ago. We see the opportunity to strategically invest in the business further by continuing to innovate the guest experience, drive guest acquisition and leverage the lululemon ecosystem for further market expansions. Meghan will provide some additional financial detail in a few moments, but we're anticipating another year of strong growth for MIRROR, with revenue expected to increase 50% to 65% to $250 million to $275 million in 2021. Let me now turn it over to Sun. But before I do, I want to acknowledge the incredible work this team continues to create. I'm proud of how Sun and the team adjusted plans this past year to ensure a strong flow of product newness in 2020. In March and April last year, our teams reevaluated and reflowed our merchandise buys for the second half of the year. We continue to bring in new innovation to our guests while we leaned into our core styles and reduced the more seasonal elements of the assortment. Looking forward, we're using our learnings from last year to inform future buys. I'm excited with our product strategies that include an increased flow of newness and technical innovations relative to last year. Sun, over to you. Sun Choe : Thanks, Calvin. I'm happy to be here to share details regarding our product innovation road map for the year ahead. 2020 was a great year for us from an innovation standpoint, but it wasn't perfect as we were forced to navigate the COVID-19 environment. We have significant opportunity in 2021 to increase our cadence of innovation. Our product team will continue to bring to market merchandise that is technical, while also offering the versatility that our guests demand as they add new dimensions to the way they live the sweat life. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel innovation platform to solve guests' unmet needs and drive expansion in our 4 major product areas across Run, Train, Yoga and On The Move.  Last year, while guests adapted to the new normal of working and sweating from home, their desire for technical athletic apparel that seamlessly transitions with them from activity to activity remains strong, and we delivered. Highlights include a relaunch of our proprietary Everlux fabric in new styles, expanding our Align franchise into tops with the launch of the Align Tank and for the first time, we offered some of our best-performing styles in a more inclusive size range. In men's, we saw particular strength in shorts with our 3 core styles, the T.H.E., Surge and Pace Breaker, all performing well throughout the year. Also exciting is our recent launch of the License to Train shorts. This short expands our train offering for men, is made from abrasion-resistant fabric and is suitable for many types of sweaty pursuits, including weight training and trail running. Guest response has been strong, and the License To Train shorts is helping grow our big 3 core shorts for men into the big 4. In Q4, our guests responded well to our holiday merchandise offerings, which included special edition products across our highly coveted Wunder Under and Align franchises in women's and our City Sweat and In My franchises for men. We saw broad-based strength across all of our major merchandise categories with high teens revenue growth in women's, men's and accessories. Drilling down a bit, outerwear, shorts, bras, underwear and equipment were particularly strong classifications, all experiencing revenue growth in excess of the high teens. Our men's business continued to strengthen with Q4 being our strongest quarter of the year. The resurgence we saw in our fixed waistband bottom towards the end of Q3 continued and as men generally prefer to shop our brick-and-mortar channel, we look for further strengthening as our stores remain open and capacity constraints subside. Let me shift gears and share some highlights on our product outlook for 2021. We firmly believe that the desire to live an active and healthy lifestyle has only strengthened over the last year. Our apparel, developed under the Science of Feel innovation lens, is designed to offer technical solve while also providing versatility and comfort. This positions us extremely well as our guests continue to find new ways to sweat now and in the future. Looking forward, we have plenty of innovation on the way for 2021, and we have hit the ground running. In Q1, we made some major moves in men's tops with 2 very exciting franchises, the Fundamental T and DrySense. The Fundamental top, which comes in long sleeve, short sleeve and sleeveless, offers a perfect combination of technicality and comfort. The fabric offers stretch, abrasion resistance, anti-stink and quick dry, all while having a cottony soft feel on the skin. While we made the short to expand our On The Move assortment, the versatility of the design also makes it perfect for hikes, runs, cross-training and other sweaty pursuits. Our DrySense franchise expands our train assortment and offers unique solutions for our guests through exceptional moisture wicking and additional technical features, including underarm gussets for increased mobility, a locker loop for easy hanging and the polyester component of the fabric is completely recycled. In women, we'll continue to bring technical solves across our major categories of Run, Train, Yoga and On The Move. In Q1, we further leveraged our Align franchise and we now offer pockets in both long and short styles. Guests loved this added feature to our #1 pant franchise and response in the launch has been fantastic. I'm also excited with the recent launch of our Swift Speed running tight. It's made from a proprietary Luxtreme fabric, which offers low friction, is breathable, wicks sweat and is cool to the touch. In addition, there are no inseams which provides for a distraction-free run. Later this year, we'll be launching our new high support bras, solving from movement management during runs and beyond. The air support bra is made with our proprietary Untralu fabric for a barely-there feel and was developed with insights from your signature movement experience that measured guest's unique movement profiles. We're also excited to reveal our special accessories capsule featuring Mylo, an infinitely renewable mycelium that highlights the role sustainable innovation can play in the future of fashion and retail. In closing, I'm thrilled that our Science of Feel innovation platform, which has fueled our momentum for the past several years, has only gotten stronger. Our brand is perfectly positioned to help our guests live into the sweat life any way they choose as our product not only offers technicality, but also comfort, versatility and beauty. Our pipeline of innovation for the coming year is robust, and we're already off to a strong start. I'd like to thank our product teams across the globe for their unwavering dedication to finding new technical solves for our guests and their invaluable contribution to our strong financial results. And now over to Meghan to take you through our financials. Meghan? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Sun. We are proud of our 2020 results in a challenging environment and are entering 2021 in a strong financial position. We pivoted our investments in 2020 to ensure we were prepared for multiple operational scenarios over our peak holiday period. The fourth quarter was impacted by more COVID-19-related store closures and capacity constraints than we originally anticipated. And we were pleased to deliver revenue growth of 24%, ahead of our expectations. In looking at 2021, we're excited about our momentum headed into the year and the opportunities in front of us. And we expect our top line growth to exceed the annual targets as laid out in our Power of Three growth plan. Also, as Calvin mentioned, we're very pleased with the performance of MIRROR, which has exceeded our initial expectations and we have made the strategic decision to continue investing in innovation and building brand awareness to drive the long-term value of the MIRROR business. This will have near-term implications for SG&A, but I will touch on it further in a moment. Let me share with you the details of our Q4 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted Q4 financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR but excludes $7.8 million of acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q4, total net revenue increased 24% to $1.7 billion, above our expectations for a mid-to-high teens increase. This included a 21% increase in North America and a 47% increase in our international business. In our digital channel, we posted a 92% comp increase on top of a 41% increase last year. e-com contributed approximately $900 million of top line or 52% of total revenue. We continue to see notable strength in traffic and conversion. Traffic was driven by channel shift, coupled with investments in digital marketing, and conversion continues to benefit from guest response to our product and the investments we've made in our global digital platform to improve guest experience. In our store channel, we had 88% of our stores open on average and saw productivity of 71% of last year's volume, in line with our expectations. Square footage increased 11% versus last year, driven by the addition of 30 net new stores since Q4 of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 6 net new stores and completed 9 planned optimizations. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was approximately $1 billion or 58.6% of net revenue compared to 58% of net revenue in Q4 2019. Our gross margin increase of 60 basis points was driven by 190 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation and product team costs and 20 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange. This was partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in product margin, primarily due to higher airfreight costs related to COVID-19 and higher markdowns, and 70 basis points of deleverage on DC costs, predominantly related to COVID-19. Moving to SG&A. Our approach in the current environment has been to prudently manage our expenses while also ensuring we continue to invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $545 million or 31.5% of net revenue compared to 28.2% of net revenue in Q4 2019. The deleverage in the quarter resulted predominantly from marketing investment associated with MIRROR, coupled with the impact of store closures, capacity constraints and COVID-19-related costs, partially offset by leverage on corporate overhead due to our 2020 expense reduction initiatives and strength of our top line. Foreign exchange also had a negative impact on SG&A in the quarter. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $466 million or 26.9% of net revenue compared to 29.8% of net revenue in Q4 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $127 million or 27.4% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 28.8% a year ago. The reduction in tax rate relative to last year was primarily due to additional deductions obtained in select international jurisdictions. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $337 million or $2.58 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $2.28 in Q4 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $58 million for the quarter compared to $69 million in the fourth quarter last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to digital channel and analytics capabilities, supply chain investment, technology spend to support our business growth and store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of total liquidity. We had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 25% versus last year and was $647 million at the end of Q4. We expect levels at the end of Q1 to increase approximately 15% relative to Q1 2020. While we are seeing some delayed inventory receipts due to the issues at the ports, we are comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and we are positioned well as we enter the spring season. I'll provide additional detail on this when I offer our gross margin guidance. We have $500 million of availability on our current share repurchase authorization. We've repurchased nearly $1.4 billion of our stock over the last 6 years, and we continue to believe share repurchases are an effective method of returning cash to shareholders. Let me shift now to our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2021. We're excited with our sales trend as we enter the new year. We have more stores opened now than we did in Q4, and our guests are responding well to our new innovations as well as the core styles in our spring assortment. We remain focused on continuing to leverage our omni model and digital strength. And we're planning for multiple operational scenarios as we navigate the continued uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. As we anniversary store closures, we are focused on 2-year top line CAGRs to normalize for the disruption of business trends last year. I will also offer some color on gross margin and SG&A relative to 2019 for Q1 given the significant impact from store closures we experienced during the first half of 2020. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion, representing a 2-year CAGR of 19% at the midpoint. In terms of stores, we currently have approximately 96% of our stores open across the globe, an improvement relative to Q4. However, we continue to experience the effects of COVID-19 in several markets. On a 2-year CAGR basis, we expect stores to be flat to slightly negative, with e-com growing at approximately 50%. We expect gross margin in Q1 to increase significantly from last year's COVID-impacted quarter and also be 50 to 100 basis points higher than Q1 of 2019. Relative to 2019, our gross margin is benefiting from a higher e-com penetration and leverage on occupancy and depreciation due to pulling back somewhat on new store openings in 2020 as well as a level of rent reductions. Our Q1 guidance reflects pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. We are strategically using airfreight to ensure we are able to meet guest demand, and we'll continue to closely monitor as we move throughout 2021. In Q1, we expect SG&A leverage versus 2020, but deleverage of approximately 400 basis points relative to 2019. Drivers of the deleverage versus 2019 include : COVID-related costs, including labor and PPE; higher depreciation due to accelerated investments to support our e-com business in 2020 and 2021; consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in the prior year; and our strategic decision to increase investment in MIRROR in 2021. While the business is still in its early stages and represents less than 5% of our total revenue, MIRROR sales exceeded our initial expectations in 2020. Given the current momentum in the at-home fitness category, we now see an even greater opportunity than we did at the time of the acquisition. The value in the MIRROR business model is the lifetime value of their guests, and we're going to invest into the current category strength to maximize the long-term value of this asset. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.90 versus EPS of $0.22 a year ago. This includes operating results from MIRROR but excludes acquisition and integration-related costs. As a reminder, we reported EPS of $0.74 in Q1 of 2019. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. This range includes $250 million to $275 million from MIRROR and assumes our e-com business grows modestly relative to the outsized strength we experienced in 2020 as we expect the majority of stores to be opened in 2021. By quarter, we expect the most robust e-com growth in Q1, a decline in Q2 as we anniversary the height of COVID-related channel shift in our online warehouse sale and then modest growth in Q3 and Q4. When looking at total revenue, our guidance range implies a 2-year CAGR of 19% at the midpoint, which is in line with our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and is ahead of the low-teens CAGR contemplated in our Power of Three growth plan. We expect to open 40 to 50 net new company-operated stores in 2021. This includes approximately 30 to 35 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the low double digits. We expect gross margin for the year to expand between 100 and 150 basis points compared to the modest increase we saw in 2020. We expect gross margin increases relative to 2020 in each quarter of the year, with the largest increase expected in Q1. For the year, the anticipated margin expansion includes approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from additional freight costs, but is still in excess of our Power of Three growth plan, which assumes modest gross margin expansion annually. The outperformance is expected to be driven primarily by a shift relative to our initial plans and investment from new store openings and remodels towards digital capabilities, which impacts SG&A. When looking at SG&A for the year, we expect deleverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2020, which is in excess of what was contemplated within our Power of Three plan. Drivers of the deleverage include consolidation of MIRROR for the full year and increased investment in MIRROR brand building. Relative to 2020, we expect predominantly all the deleverage to impact the second and third quarters. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be similar to 2020, with the Q1 rate being lower than the other quarters. We expect our fiscal year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. Our EPS guidance assumes modest dilution from MIRROR in the range of 3% to 5%, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs. We're excited with the momentum we're seeing in this business, particularly the growing community of people sweating with MIRROR, which contributes to increased brand awareness and strong long-term financial returns. But as I mentioned earlier, MIRROR remains early in its life cycle and we've made the strategic decision to invest more than initially anticipated to build long-term value in this business. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $335 million to $345 million for 2021. The increase versus 2020 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations, including MIRROR shop-in-shops as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. I've already provided our guidance on Q1, but let me share some additional details to keep in mind as we model out the rest of the year. Taking into account my prior remarks on gross margin, SG&A and tax, you will see that we expect adjusted EPS growth in each quarter of the year relative to 2020, with the rate of growth likely below that currently implied by FactSet consensus in Q2 and Q3 and relatively in line with consensus in Q4. As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with our momentum at the start of the year, and we are excited with the opportunities in front of us in 2021. Before handing it back to Calvin, I want to thank our teams across the globe for their agility and commitment to our brand every day, which drives our financial strength. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. In closing, I would like to reiterate how pleased we are with how lululemon performed over the quarter and the full year. We see many opportunities to build upon this year's performance by leaning into our strengths : innovative product, expanding our omni-capabilities and continuing to grow around the world. As I mentioned, when we look back at 2020, I believe we will see this as a pinnacle moment for lululemon when we were able to pull forward many future innovations that will create upside for the brand well into the future. All of us on the leadership team are grateful for the continued support and loyalty of our employees, our ambassadors and our guests who continue to be there for one another and make these results possible. And with that, Sun, Meghan, Alex and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I want to just focus on the investments in MIRROR for a minute. The 3% to 5% dilution, you're obviously above what you had initially expected and I think what we were all expecting. So in light of that, can you just maybe frame out your expectations for the long-term opportunities of the business that are getting you so excited about this -- the ability to invest now in the content? Meghan Frank : Yes. Lorraine, it's Meghan. So as we mentioned, MIRROR sales in 2020 exceeded our initial expectations at approximately $170 million. And we did guide to $250 million to $275 million for 2021. They are still very early in their life cycle and the path to profitability there is very much within our control. That said, looking at the business, the value is really in the long term and the long-term value of the subscription revenue. So we've learned a lot since we purchased the business and COVID created an even greater opportunity than we saw at that time. And we're going to invest behind the momentum we see in that business to really drive that long-term value. And you heard Calvin talk a little bit about some of the key investment areas that include adding production studios, adding an instructor -- instructors to the base, launching new features and then expansion into Canada as well as importantly, over 200 shop-in-shops in our North America lululemon stores. In terms of the long-term opportunity for the business, I think we'll continue to learn a lot in 2021. We're not going to put a time point on it right now, but we'll continue to share more as we create our plans for 2022 and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : So with respect to the 2021 guide, I think it implies kind of EBIT margins that are a couple hundred basis points below 2019. Maybe just break that down for us a little bit more. I guess, how much of that compression is the MIRROR investments versus your outlook for the core? And then just bigger picture with respect to the Power of Three and the longer-term goals. Obviously, well ahead when it comes to digital, but just maybe give us a sense of what, if anything, has changed in terms of the longer-term ambitions and how that might flow through the P&L over the next couple of years? Meghan Frank : Mark, it's Meghan. So if you take into consideration the color I offered on guidance, lululemon operating margin is slightly above 2019. So on track, essentially for our Power of Three growth plans. And that dilution really is driven by the MIRROR investment that I just outlined and really geared towards investing into that business to drive the long-term value. In terms of Power of Three, you're right, we're further along, as Calvin mentioned, than we anticipated in terms of digital strength. We aren't revising our plan right now. But as you can see, we're in good shape to meet that plan. Mark Altschwager : A quick follow-up there. Can you talk about your progress towards scaling the business in China? And just from a -- maybe from a margin perspective, where that sits relative to the company average and how you're planning that progression? Calvin McDonald : Mark, it's Calvin. Just quickly on the Power of Three initiatives, doubling men's, doubling digital, quadrupling international, and then I'll quickly jump into certain markets. We're on pace on men's, on pace on international and arriving early ahead on our digital, as we said. So as Meghan alluded to, we're in a very good position at this point in our commitments and excited about the momentum in the business and opportunities to keep investing in innovation, investing in growth. MIRROR is one of those areas that because the business is doing well, we're choosing to invest in a business that we know will add value through further guest relationships, building out that community and the value of the subscription model. So excited about those. And China is equal to those opportunities for us to invest in. We are very happy with our business and growth. We've shared multiple times last year, the growth in both our store-based business and international. As well, I mentioned that heading into '21, our plan is to open more stores in the market than we've ever opened in the 15 to 20 range. That would put us well over 50 stores at this point in time. And we're very pleased with both the top line, bottom line performance in that market, and we keep investing in that market local head office to empower the teams to drive relevancy. So I'm excited about our international business in all markets. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Calvin, for you, you talked about gaining a point of share in 2020. I'm curious to how you think about your ability to continue to gain market share in 2021, particularly as several large global brands are doubling down on their women's business. And then maybe just a clarification on MIRROR. What have you seen in terms of the consumer appetite on some of the pricing that you've played around with? I think during the holiday season, if you were to buy it in store, there were different promotional opportunities to get it slightly cheaper. Are you pleased with the current price position of the MIRROR just before you scale it out to more doors this year? Calvin McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Erinn. First, on market share, very optimistic with the product that Sun indicated that we will continue to grow share across both men's and women's. We did so in 2020. I believe we were the only of the major brands to do -- to achieve that goal. And we have a very strong business in women's. And I understand that others are identifying and seeing that as a growth potential. But we have a very strong commitment with our guests, very strong franchises, but equally, if not even more important, a very significant pipeline of newness that we're going to continue to build out and delight that guest with in terms of activities into yoga, further into train and run and introducing some new activities. So I'm very confident in our ability through innovation and knowing what we're bringing, that we're going to see growth and success both with men and women and then the men, the opportunity, as we've shared in the past, is really driving that awareness. And we have some exciting initiatives that we'll share, further plan this year to continue to engage, drive awareness and consideration for our male guests as we continue to build out and drive that relationship and success with our women's. Yoga and our female guests, we know are critical parts. And as we look to grow into other areas and opportunity, just know that the team is 100% focused on maintaining and growing that relationship in those segments as well. And in terms of MIRROR, we did do some interesting testing, and we continue to. The benefit of the business being new is that we're doing a lot with Brent and team on test and learn, on both how to acquire and drive the awareness, which remains a big opportunity and price, elasticity behind the product. And right now positioned at the retail price point with a free shipping offering resonates very well. The guest prefers that sort of combination. And then we pulse in a variety of promotional opportunities when it's either competitively appropriate to do so or we see an opportunity. We've tried a number from a discount of $200 to $300 being the peak. So the net price being $1,200. And as well as bundling opportunities. And feedback from the guest is very encouraging that a number of levers -- of registers with them. So it gives us the ability to not just sort of play 1 promotional lever in order to drive that opportunity to invest into the MIRROR. So we have a number of levers that we've tested and validated that we'll continue to do. We have a good price position in and around the $1,200 to $1,500 that they respond well to. And we'll continue to operate with that as well as we look to expansion in the Canadian market price accordingly. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Trussel with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just wanted to ask about what you're seeing today in terms of store traffic and productivity? And how are you thinking about the cadence of store productivity over the course of the year? And then second, you did mention that air freight, higher markdowns and distribution expenses were headwinds in this current period, offsetting some of the occupancy leverage and other savings. Just speak to the extent that when these headwinds may continue. Meghan Frank : Paul, it's Meghan. So in terms of productivity, we saw productivity in stores of 71% in Q4, which was in line with our expectations. We do now, in Q1, have more stores open at 96% and we are not in our peak traffic period. So the constrained impact is lessening. We do expect that to improve as we move throughout the year, but we are planning as we did in 2021 -- or in 2020 for multiple scenarios so that we're able to meet our omni-guest demand. So we'll continue to iterate on that as we move throughout 2021. In terms of margin rates, we offered that we see expansion on a year of 100 to 150 basis points. Included in that is 50 basis points of pressure related to airfreight. We don't see that as a barrier to revenue upside. We'll continue to strategically leverage airfreight to drive revenue and continue to closely monitor that throughout the year. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats again on the nice quarter. Calvin, maybe as we think about recovery post pandemic, so do you anticipate -- or maybe are you seeing signs of pent-up demand for technical innovation on the sweat side of the business as in-person or maybe people begin to think about in-person fitness again? And then I'm curious how you see lulu's lifestyle assortment positioned to take market share if casualization is, in fact, greater post pandemic? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matthew. As I indicated, our technical performance of our product all through 2020 was the drivers of our growth predominantly. And I don't see that diminishing in any way. I think people are finding ways to sweat, they've adopted new ways to sweat. And when the world opens up, and they'll be able to go back to their gyms and their studios, they'll just have a balance of ways in which they're engaging. And we have a lot more new guests or existing guests using a lot more of our technical product. That is going to just drive an appreciation for and loyalty to the uniqueness of how it performs. So from a recovery standpoint, I feel all the momentum in the business behind driving even more adoption and success of our technical performance as we saw in 2020, and I think it's only going to be more pronounced moving forward. From an OTM perspective, we're early in our development of OTM in our women's category. The team has been building that for the last few years and adding assortment, and we test and launched a key product next year, we will add more to the assortment this year and in the years to come. So we're very early that we're well positioned through our technical apparel to build that business as guests look to shift, but when they shift back to more other casual wear, they're going to be looking for something that I believe is unique and different in the technical apparel fashion, and some of the team are creating and building that. And men's -- that's been 1 of our strengths in men's. Women's is going to catch up to our men's offering. And we have full confidence in our success and strength in men's in that OTM business and the work and the product that's following that is going to keep fueling the OTM. At the heart and the core, the technical performance gear did perform, is performing, and I think it's only going to perform more moving forward. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on SG&A. Meghan, so outside of MIRROR and the pull forward that you've cited of the DTC investments, I guess my question is on an underlying basis, is there any change to the annual plan, I think that you laid out at the Analyst Day, for modest SG&A leverage on low teens revenues this year? And then as you see it today, is there any reason the model doesn't return to that plan on a reported basis after this year? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Matt. So as I mentioned, if you consider the color I provided, from an operating income perspective, lululemon is essentially in line with Analyst Day. And we have a bit more expansion in margin and a bit more pressure on SG&A, and that's because of the shift in investment profile between channels. So pulling back somewhat on store openings and investing behind digital, the store expenses show up in gross margin and the digital expenses show up in SG&A. So I'd say a little bit of a near-term impact, and we continue to monitor that for the long term, and we're really focused on optimizing the bottom line of our business. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : So I just wanted to talk about men's versus women's. Men's seem to be underperforming through the year. And just because your women's business was just so much stronger. I think you kind of leveled out in 4Q. I'm just trying to look at the filing now, but can you kind of explain what was going on between the 2 genders in your business? And is there anything that's changed as you come into 2021? And again, I don't know if that's just behavior or if that's just product or innovation. Just anything you could elaborate on, Calvin, would be great. Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, for sure. Thanks, Ike. We've -- I would tell you, our assessment is 100% behavior. Looking at his behavior at the beginning of the pandemic and shifts of where he was purchasing, how he was purchasing drove a lot of the declines in apparel that the industry saw in the men's categories. And that started to pick up throughout the year. Our impact was less in the industry at the beginning, and it picked up quicker at the tail end. In our fourth quarter, our men's business trailed our women's business, but it was the narrowest gap from the entire year that we saw. And as Meghan indicated, the start of this year has been very, very strong for us, and the men's business continues that road to recovery. So it -- in my opinion, was 100% behavior and as stores come online and we're seeing that shift back into apparel, that it will come back to where we were in terms of performance and growth driving. Even with that, we are on pace to double our men's business per our commitment in our 5-year and seeing very good results and strength back to the men's business already to start this year. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the lululemon athletica First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which have -- which we have assessed, but which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales and store productivity metrics given on today's call are in constant dollars. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our Investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions]. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and hi, everyone. I'm excited to speak with you about our first quarter results and the momentum we're seeing across the business. As the press release describes, we're off to a particularly strong start to 2021, with revenue growth of 88% over the same period last year. And when you look at our 2-year CAGR, our performance truly stands out and shows the sustained momentum in the business. Our first quarter results reflected our strength across all drivers of growth, fueled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business, our performance across categories and geographies, and a rebound in the number of guests shopping in our brick-and-mortar stores. I want to take a moment to recognize the resiliency and agility of our teams across the globe. Their commitment and dedication enables this impressive performance, and it would not be possible without them. On today's call, I will speak to our first quarter results, our Power of Three growth pillars and the progress toward delivering against our impact initiatives. You'll also hear from Meghan Frank, our CFO, with further details about our Q1 financial performance and our guidance outlook. We'll then be happy to take your questions. Looking at the quarter, our results were driven by strength across channels, regions and product categories. Here are a few key operating metrics. Firstly, our total revenue of $1.2 billion reflects an increase of 25% on a 2-year CAGR basis. This growth rate represents an acceleration relative to our 3-year CAGR of 19%, leading up to the pandemic, and reinforces that we remain early in our life cycle and have a unique business model that allows us to thrive in an ever-changing environment. In addition, our revenue increased across each of our regions, up 23% in North America and up 41% in our international markets, both on a 2-year CAGR basis. Secondly, growth within our e-commerce business remains strong, with comps up 50%, which is on top of the 70% increase in the same quarter last year. And thirdly, adjusted earnings per share were $1.16 versus $0.74 in 2019, significantly ahead of our expectations.  And we are also pleased to see our momentum extending into the second quarter. We delivered at this high level while we also strategically managed a number of ongoing macro operating challenges, such as continued store closures, capacity constraints, supply chain challenges at the ports and reduced air freight capacity. While challenges of all types will no doubt remain going forward, I'm confident we will continue to manage them effectively and deliver outstanding results. In summary, lululemon continues to become stronger quarter after quarter. We are very early in our growth story, and we are well positioned for the post-pandemic world. And the opportunities ahead of us are significant and continue to expand. I will now provide a bit more color on the first quarter results. We are firmly on track to deliver on our commitments contained in our Power of Three growth plan, through our 3 pillars of product innovation, omni-guest experience and market expansion. Within product innovation, we continue to leverage our Science of Feel platform to deliver technical athletic apparel to our guests. Our sweet spot is creating versatile and stylish products that include technical innovation, comfort and flexibility. In the first quarter, we saw strength across our assortment with women's revenue increasing 23% and  men's growing 27% on a 2-year CAGR basis. I will now share a few more thoughts related to our product. We saw strength in women's across the assortment as guests are responding well to both tops and bottoms. Our performance in tops was driven by core styles and franchise extensions, such as the Align tank. Our male guests returned to our stores as we emerged from the pandemic. Men's growth outpaced women's growth on both a 1- and 2-year basis, and we are seeing very positive momentum in our On The Move assortment. Across both the women's and men's businesses, our sales success reflects our ability to consistently introduce new innovation to our guests as we expand core and newer categories and leverage our spectrum of raw materials. We're in the early days of our product journey with ample opportunity to expand across our 4 key product areas of Yoga, Run, Train and On The Move. And speaking of Run, this quarter, we launched a global run campaign that highlights how we are making running more accessible and inclusive. And we took a broad-based approach that included messaging that featured male and female athletes in a broad range of products. A platform that highlighted existing ambassadors along with new ambassadors, such as Ultra Marathon Runner, Mirna Valerio; Brooklyn-based filmmaker and founder of Running to Protest, Coffey; Canadian 10,000 meter record holder, Natasha Wodak; and Olympian leader and mentor, Colleen Quigley. I'm pleased with the results of our Run campaign, and it's an example of the leadership Nikki Neuberger, our Chief Brand Officer, is bringing to the company. And I look forward to her joining us on a future call. Let me now turn to our omni-guest pillar and the strength we saw across channels in Q1, with the upside in revenue driven by both our stores and e-commerce businesses. Here are a few highlights I'd like to share. The healthy comps in our e-commerce channel were driven by a mix of new and existing guests. We're also happy to see the investments in our digital business paying off, and we're continuing to improve product education, offer better outfitting solutions and tell stories in a more compelling way. When looking at our store channel, I remain very enthusiastic about our performance. We are committed to stores, and we are building more stores this year and seeing more and more great real estate opportunities become available in great areas in key cities around the globe. We will continue to be opportunistic in grabbing these locations as they become available. We are also fortunate to have our store teams in a good position as well. The pay protection initiative we implemented last year for employees has allowed us to retain and engage them throughout this period. This meant we could reopen stores quickly and this agile and dedicated team has allowed us to continue to support the increased traffic momentum in the stores that we are experiencing now. This helped us deliver against our plans to kickstart our stores and reengage our store-only guests. Here are some details on our performance. Firstly, store productivity improved to 88% of our levels in 2019. This exceeded our expectation and moves us towards our goal to return to productivity levels consistent with 2019. Secondly, even as traffic to our stores increased significantly in the quarter, conversion remains strong and continues to increase in the double digits. And as a reminder, these capacity constraints are just starting to lift in many markets in this quarter. Touching on MIRROR. We continue to be pleased with the performance of MIRROR and the opportunities within the at-home fitness space. MIRROR had a strong Mother's Day and remains on track to deliver $250 million to $275 million in revenue in 2021. We continue to leverage the lululemon ecosystem, and by the middle of this month, MIRROR will be featured in nearly 90 lululemon locations in the United States. We're well on our way to 200 shop-in-shops in time for the holidays later this year. In addition, we now have dedicated MIRROR specialists among our educators in each of these stores, and the early sales results are encouraging. We will have more to share about MIRROR later in the year as we gear up for new features, add more live classes and expand into Canada, the first international market of several we will see in the future for MIRROR. Switching now to our international growth. We continue to be very pleased with our results and our growth potential across our 3 regions of China, Asia Pacific and EMEA. Andre Maestrini has hit the ground running as he leads our international team and sets ambitious growth goals, and I look forward to having Andre join us in the future for a call. From our new stores in China to continued growth in Asia Pacific to our online performance in EMEA, the results continue to reinforce that we are early in the growth trajectory. And as I have said before, I can see a time in the near future where our international business grows in size to be equal to our North America business. In closing, I'm proud to share a few details about our latest impact initiatives, which helps us to achieve our multiyear goals, including our goal to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials and end-of-use solutions. We launched lululemon Like New last month, our first re-commerce program. This is a trade-in and resale program for our guests, and all of the profits are reinvested in our sustainability initiatives. We have launched in California and Texas, and the response is encouraging. This kind of program reduces carbon water and waste and also enables us to attract new guests, particularly younger guests who are fans of thrifting. In the quarter, we also introduced our Earth Dye collection, which is made completely from materials upcycled from plants and uses less water, and is an example of the type of collections we're expanding in the future. In closing, these results and our continued focus on innovation demonstrate our confidence in the future and how we can continue to pull the many levers of growth we have available to us. Let me now hand it over to Meghan for a review of our first quarter financials and our guidance outlook. Meghan? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. Our Q1 results were strong relative to last year's COVID-impacted quarter, but more importantly, relative to Q1 of 2019 as well. On a 2-year CAGR basis, we saw double-digit top line growth across all major regions, with the standout being Mainland China, with an approximately 90% 2-year revenue CAGR. We also saw broad-based strength across merchandise categories, with women's, men's and accessories all growing in excess of 20% on a 2-year basis. We are proud of these results despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, and we have strong momentum moving into Q2 as reflected in our updated guidance I will share in a moment. Let me now share with you the details of our Q1 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR, but exclude approximately $8 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effects in Q1 2021, and $2 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effects in Q1 2020. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q1, total net revenue increased 88% to $1.2 billion, above our expectations of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion. This included an 82% increase in North America and a 125% increase in our international business. On a 2-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 25%. In our digital channel, revenues increased 61% on a 2-year CAGR basis, above our expectations of approximately 50% growth. e-comm contributed $545 million of top line or 44% of total revenue. We continue to see strength in traffic and conversion. Traffic was driven by both new and existing guests, and conversion continues to benefit from positive guest response to the enhancements we've been making to our e-comm space and mobile app. In our store channel, sales increased 3% on a 2-year CAGR basis, above our expectations of flat to slightly negative. Looking at store productivity relative to 2019, Q1 improved to 88% versus 71% in Q4 of 2020. At the end of the first quarter, we had 93% of our stores open. Square footage increased 10% versus last year, driven by the addition of 34 net new stores since Q1 of 2020. During the quarter, we opened 2 net new stores. Gross profit for the first quarter was $700 million or 57.1% of net revenue, compared to 51.3% of net revenue in Q1 2020 and 53.9% of net revenue in Q1 2019. Our gross margin increase of 320 basis points relative to 2019 was driven by 220 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation and product team costs; an 80 basis point increase in product margin, with the decline in markdowns versus 2019 and despite higher airfreight expense related to COVID-19. In addition, we had 20 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $497 million or 40.5% of net revenue compared to 46% of net revenue in Q1 2020 and 37.4% of net revenue in Q1 2019. Leverage in the quarter relative to Q1 2020 resulted from the sales increase relative to the COVID-impacted quarter last year. The deleverage relative to Q1 2019 is the result of consolidation of MIRROR's results this year, but not in 2019, coupled with higher depreciation due to accelerated investments to support our e-comm business and COVID-related operating channel costs. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $202 million, or 16.4% of net revenue compared to 5.3% of net revenue in Q1 2020 and 16.5% of net revenue in Q1 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $49.5 million or 24.5% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 14.7% a year ago. In both Q1 2021 and Q1 2020, our tax rate benefited from certain discrete tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. However, since our Q1 2020 profit before tax was significantly lower due to the impact of COVID, this meant that these additional discrete tax deductions had a bigger impact on our tax rate last year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $152 million or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.23 in Q1 of 2020 and $0.74 in Q1 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $64 million for the quarter compared to $52 million in the first quarter last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to digital channel and analytics capabilities, supply chain investment, technology spend to support our business growth and store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of total liquidity. We had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 17% versus last year and was $733 million at the end of Q1. On a 2-year CAGR basis, inventory in Q1 increased 29%. While we continue to see some delayed inventory receipts due to issues at the ports, our team is strategically using air freight, and we are comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory as we move into Q2. At the end of Q2, we expect levels to increase approximately 25% to 30% relative to Q2 2020. In Q1, we repurchased 270,000 shares at an average price of $311. At the end of the quarter, we had $416 million of availability remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Let me shift now to our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2021. Our guests continue to respond well to our merchandise offering, including both tactical and On The Move apparel and MIRROR. As we are welcoming guests back to our stores, we also remain focused on our digital business and omni capabilities to ensure we are there for our guests no matter how they want to engage with us. We also continue to plan for multiple operational scenarios as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 environment. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.33 billion, representing a 2-year CAGR of 21% to 23%. In terms of stores, we currently have approximately 93% of our stores open. On a 2-year CAGR basis, we expect stores to be approximately flat, with e-comm growing at approximately 55%. We expect gross margin in Q2 to increase from last year's COVID-impacted quarter and also be 30 to 50 basis points higher than Q2 of 2019. Relative to 2019, our gross margin is benefiting from a higher e-comm penetration. And leverage on occupancy and depreciation due to pulling back somewhat on new store openings in 2020 as well as the level of rent reductions. Our Q2 guidance reflects continued pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. In Q2, we expect SG&A deleverage of approximately 400 basis points relative to 2019. Drivers of the deleverage versus 2019 include higher depreciation due to accelerated investments to support our e-commerce business in 2020 and 2021; consolidation of MIRROR's results this year, but not in 2019; and COVID-related costs, including labor for stores that remain closed. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.15 versus EPS of $0.74 a year ago. This includes operating results from MIRROR but excludes acquisition and integration-related costs. As a reminder, we reported EPS of $0.96 in Q2 of 2019. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $5.83 billion to $5.91 billion. This range continues to include $250 million to $275 million for MIRROR and now assumes our e-commerce business grows in the high single digits relative to the outsized strength we experienced in 2020. For e-comm, we expect a modest decline in Q2 as we anniversary the height of COVID-related channel shifts and our online warehouse sale. And we continue to expect modest growth in Q3 and Q4. When looking at total revenue, our guidance range implies a 2-year CAGR of 21% to 22%, which is higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19% leading up to 2020 and is well ahead of the low teens CAGR contemplated in our Power of Three growth plan. We now expect to open 45 to 55 net new company-operated stores in 2021, up from our prior guidance of 40 to 50. This includes approximately 35 to 40 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the low teens. We now expect gross margin for the year to expand between 150 to 200 basis points compared to the modest increase we saw in 2020. For the year, the anticipated margin expansion continues to include approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from additional freight costs, but it's still in excess of our Power of Three plan, which assumes modest gross margin expansion annually. The outperformance is expected to be driven primarily by a shift relative to our initial plans and investments from new store openings and remodels towards digital, which impacts SG&A. When looking at SG&A for the full year, we now expect deleverage of 30 to 50 basis points versus 2020. Drivers of the deleverage continued to include consolidation of MIRROR for the full year and investment in MIRROR brand building. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be similar to 2020. We now expect our fiscal year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.73 to $6.86. Our EPS guidance continues to assume modest dilution from MIRROR in the 3% to 5% range, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs. It also excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $365 million to $375 million for 2021. The increase versus 2020 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations, including MIRROR shop and shops, as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Before handing it back to Calvin, I want to thank our teams across the globe for their agility, enthusiasm and dedication to lululemon that allows us to deliver these consistently strong financial results. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. Before we take your questions, I just want to say on behalf of the entire management team that we are grateful to our teams who helped us deliver these results, you who are helping us raise our expectation about what's possible for lululemon this year and well into the future. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And congratulations on the great start to the year and the momentum continuing. Calvin, my first question is for you. It's about, as you become a global brand and now you have MIRROR and you're investing in that for marketing, are there any change in how you philosophically think about the marketing, the advertising expense line, demand creation, so to speak? And when we're thinking about MIRROR, how should we think about the slight dilution coming in the form of increased ad spend? And when might we, in the future, think about sort of a breakeven notion? I guess, another way of asking sort of that probably more simply is when you are building the brand for MIRROR, do you think about investing for top line growth first and maybe not necessarily prioritizing profits given that there's so much opportunity there? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. I'll try to compartmentalize that question because there's a lot of exciting topics embedded in that. Overall, from a brand perspective, I would tell you, as I highlighted with our Run campaign in this quarter, it's one of many ways we're looking at increasing both awareness and consideration for lululemon moving forward. And that applies to all markets we're in, both U.S., Canada and internationally. And Nikki and the team are in a variety of different initiatives this year where we're testing and learning ways to do more at top of funnel. That's all included in the guidance that Meghan shared. But we are excited about the different initiatives we have planned because we see a huge opportunity around driving awareness and consideration, both for men's as well as women and in every market we're in, and we're going to lean in and do more of that. And the Run campaign is an example of us marketing ourselves more as a dual gender, showcasing both men and women, as well as leveraging our ambassadors, our community and the influencers and those key relationships. So there's a lot of work underway, and we absolutely see the ability to drive awareness consideration for lululemon. Similarly, in MIRROR, there's a lot of opportunity around awareness and consideration. That's where we see leveraging synergies within lululemon in the stores and leveraging the 10 million guests that the brand has to help drive that. And we know we're investing as an acquisition vehicle to get guests in and purchase MIRROR. And that's in the guidance as well, but we'll continue to do that. Fast forward, these brands are going to continue to be able to leverage one another, and we see synergies in the community. We see synergies in refer a friend. We see synergies across the ambassadors and the content that we're producing. So we're early in how we bring awareness across both brands to each other brand and excited about what we're seeing in the plans we have moving forward. And I'll let Meghan just pick up a little bit on your question around the investments. Meghan Frank : Hi, Adrienne. So in terms of the investments and the path to breakeven, so we were really pleased by what we saw with MIRROR performance in 2020, and it exceeded our expectations for sales at $170 million. And then we're reiterating our guidance for -- or our guidance color for MIRROR for 2021, revenue range of $2.50 to $2.75, and EPS dilution of 3% to 5%. And we have a number of exciting initiatives teed up for this year, including expanding instructors, expanding studios, moving into Canada. And then going into over 200 lululemon stores. It's still early in the year for us just given the seasonality of that business, the ramp in store openings as well as just that growth curve we're experiencing in the MIRROR business. We did have a strong Mother's Day, pleased with that performance. And in terms of breakeven, we aren't putting a fine point on it right now. But excited about the future there. Definitely see it as a profitable business for us over the longer-term and very much within our control. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Unknown Analyst : Yes. This is Kate on for Ike. Calvin, I guess, just at a higher level. You spoke to, in the quarter, the business accelerating with a 25% CAGR, I believe, on a 2-year basis versus what you were running pre pandemic. I'm just curious now that we're that much further along in the recovery, how you are evaluating perhaps a widening TAM opportunity on the other side of COVID? That would be helpful. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Kate. I definitely -- and as I've stated before, we were performing well before the pandemic. I think we led the peer group during the pandemic, and we're excited about the performance, and confidence in our ability to continue to perform post pandemic. And that's driven by the sustainable acceleration in consumer trends of living a healthier life, versatile apparel, at-home sweat and the connection of community and community sweat, all play into our strengths. And we're early innings of growth. This quarter is a great example of that. Growth across channels, stores and dot com, stores -- growth across categories, across gender, men and women in our geographies. So very much early innings on that. And as that impacts and relates to TAM, MIRROR, by addition, creates a sizable TAM for us that we're excited about. We're investing in because we see a meaningful business there, a profitable business, a stand-alone P&L that equally will impact the lululemon brand through strengthening the community and helping to influence and drive apparel sales. So that clearly is one addition to our TAM that we're excited about and we've added to. And then I think with sweat, in general, we're seeing ongoing trends. Our positioning around Run, Yoga, and Train continue to resonate and be the key activities. We have versatility and see some excitement in hike as well as OTM. And OTM for her, we're just getting started. We know it's a good business for our men's business as we're building and adding. But we really have a limited OTM assortment for her, and we are leaning into that. We have dropped some with a real plan to continue to grow that out. So I would say OTM for women's, MIRROR and then you know we're bringing footwear next year are 3 sizable TAM opportunities that we're adding to the ongoing mix of what the trend in the guest is happening and adding to the overall growth in activewear. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Congrats on the strong start here. Maybe just to start off to follow up on, Calvin, the comments you were just making on the OTM. I guess maybe just from a marketing standpoint, I mean there's been a lot of innovation with the On The Move assortment, and that would seem to be particularly relevant I guess today, as guests are returning to travel and in-person activities. Just can you speak a little bit more about how you plan to amplify that message, both with existing guests as well as for new guest acquisition? Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, for sure, Mark. And I'll break it down from product and then into women's -- sorry, men's and then as to women. So with our men, we continue to innovate into our raw material as well as some of our key franchises. So building out on our ABC and commuter, we've added the Bowline, which we continue to see respond very well and see growth in that. As we do more top of market -- top-of-funnel activity through marketing and drive that awareness and consideration, we know OTM is one of our big hooks that gets him into the brand, and then we migrate them into the sweat and into other categories. So I think that flywheel is working, is gaining momentum. And as we continue to invest top of funnel, we'll only pick up steam. On the women's side of OTM, it really starts with product for us. And we have limited assortment. And when we drop it, she responds incredibly well to it. We're excited about our ongoing expansion of our bottoms more into the OTM casual off the body fit. We're excited about our sweater initiatives in the back half and we're excited about '22 and beyond as we really look to create versatile solutions for those slots in her wardrobe. And that, I think we absolutely have an opportunity to tap into our existing guest and sell those incremental opportunities to her. So with women, it's really about assortment, and we're early with plans to expand. And with him, we're going to keep adding and innovating, but we have a good base to start, and top-of-funnel activity will help fuel that even further. Mark Altschwager : And then for Meghan, as we think about the path to recovery, is it your expectation that the store productivity can return to pre-pandemic levels or even grow from pre-pandemic levels? Or is some of this channel shift permanent? And a lot of different regional trends that are embedded in the productivity metric you shared, just maybe any insight you can share on some of the trends in regions that have perhaps had restrictions relaxed for the longest? Meghan Frank : Sure. Thanks, Mark. So we were really pleased with the improvement we saw in store productivity in Q1, at 88% versus 71% in Q4. We did see improvement as capacity restrictions moderated throughout the quarter. And we do fully expect to achieve 2019 levels of store productivity. At this point in time, we're not going to put a time frame on it, just given ongoing uncertainties related to COVID. And we still have a level of store closures in play at this point in time, but we're really encouraged by trends we're seeing in our store base. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : And congrats again on the momentum. So maybe first is on the margin front. So on gross margin, first quarter, more than 300 basis points above 2019. I guess, maybe could you just help bridge drivers in the second quarter forecast that you're embedding relative to 2019? And just any back half assumptions for us to consider as we think about the gross margin line through the cadence of the year? Meghan Frank : Sure, Matt. So in terms of Q1, and this is relative to 2019, we had 320 basis points of expansion versus our initial expectation of 50 to 100. That 320 basis points was driven by 220 basis points of occupancy and depreciation and product team, leverage really on that higher sales achievement. And then 80 basis points increase in product margin. We did see some good trends relative to 2019 in markdown rates. And we also did experience some pressure, as we've discussed, on higher air freight expense. And then we had 20 basis points of favorability in FX. When we look to Q2, again, relative to 2019, we are looking for 30 to 50 basis points of expansion relative to 2019 and really, we are expecting continued headwinds in air freight. And then we have some level of rent concessions that we're anniversary-ing from last year. And then our Q2 revenue growth rate is slightly lower than Q1, leading to that delta. In terms of the full year, we've given some color relative to 2020. So we're expecting, for the full year, 150 to 200 basis points expansion versus last year, and that is up from our prior expectation of 100 to 150 basis points. Matthew Boss : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up for Calvin. On the outsized growth that you're seeing in e-commerce relative to the sequential improvement that you're also seeing at brick-and-mortar, I guess, any changes in consumer preferences that you saw take place over the first quarter? Or maybe into May, as we think by category, maybe tied more to recovery, the return of sport and some physical activity relative to the lifestyle side as maybe people are thinking about or actually leaving their houses and returning to some normal activity? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Great. Thanks, Matt. As we shared, our active -- what we define as our active wear was still the predominant driver of our business last year. It's the core of our assortment, and it was the core of our drivers in Q1. It was good to see our men's business come back as strong as it did. We saw it continue to accelerate through 2020 and into 2021 in the quarter and then get back to its position of driving the overall growth ahead of -- slightly ahead of women's. And that was really all through the sweat activity. Shorts performed incredibly well. And we did see an uptick in OTM and very encouraged with that momentum continuing. And then with her, again, active wear was the driver, very balanced across all of our categories. Shorts and tops, did see a very nice acceleration in growth. The team has been doing a lot of work in our top business, building out our franchises, which is a big part of our franchise strategies that I've shared with everybody that we are early in taking the franchise of our bottoms and extending that feel state through Science of Feel, head to toe. Align tank being an example of one, but we have not done that consistently across the others, and we're starting to and when we do see, responds incredibly well. So our tops business really performed nicely as well as shorts, but it was very much balanced across all categories, men's and women's and geography. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to follow-up on Mark's question. He was talking about store productivity returning to 2019 levels. And I wanted to ask about the store profitability. You made some further progress there in the first quarter. Is there any reason why the store margins wouldn't get back to 2019 and perhaps surpass them as you move back toward 100% productivity? Meghan Frank : Hi Lorraine, it's Meghan. Yes, I think we are still dealing with a degree of COVID-related expense in our store channel as well as the pressure from productivity, so store COVID-related labor as well as PPE. And I don't expect there's any barriers to reaching 2019 store profitability levels once the productivity is normalized. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the nice progress. Calvin, part of the Power of Three and what you've talked about is international, and it sounds as if the international opportunity could be even a little bit -- occur a little bit faster than expected, with the sizing that you talked about and also now with category expansion. How do you size up international? And any learnings from what you've seen in any of the regions you're currently in, even though small, that could be impactful for growth going forward? And lastly, as you talked about COVID costs -- you mentioned COVID costs, how do you see those adjusting or winding down moving forward? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Dana. I'll take international and then hand off to Meghan on the COVID expenses. Obviously, I think the numbers indicate the potential that we have internationally. And I think for the last few calls, I've shared the long-term opportunity of this brand, this business being 50-50 North America-international. And I don't see anything that's going to prevent us from achieving those results. We're seeing good growth in every market. In EMEA, we continue to see growth even with the pressure on stores because our dot com business continued to drive growth. And in every market, we're in Australia, New Zealand or rest of APAC, very solid momentum in China being one of our biggest potentials and continue to see momentum in there. We were up 200% in the quarter, strong growth in stores, strong growth in dot com and excited about that. So our commitment was to quadruple the business. We are definitely achieving those results and excited to share the next future of growth as we continue to see the maturity of these markets and invest in them. We're in the right markets. And we're early in terms of our share potential in these. So we're really leaning in and focused on maintaining and growing the momentum in these markets. And then with Andre, we'll be able to come back on a later call and share the future plans for continuing to drive growth. And then, Meghan? Meghan Frank : Great. Hi, Dana. So in terms of COVID costs, we are beginning to see those wind down. It will really be dependent on the environment. We remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan, operating profit growth in excess of sales growth and really focused on managing our business to that. We did see operating margins for Q1 at 16.4%, which compared to 16.5% in Q1 of 2019. This year's Q1 included MIRROR. So we saw, underlying that, some really nice expansion in lululemon -- in the lululemon side of the business and really on track to that Power of Three growth plan. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious about input costs, what you're seeing and how we should think about AUC over the next several quarters and into next year? And also just how you're thinking about pricing in a potentially inflationary environment? Meghan Frank : Hey Paul, it's Meghan. So in terms of input costs, we're not seeing any material impact on 2021. And anything we are experiencing is reflected in our guidance. We definitely have a close eye on the market and are managing and mitigating any pressures as we move into 2021 -- sorry, 2022, and we'll certainly come back and share more when we provide 2022 color. Calvin McDonald : And then just adding on to that, Paul, as it relates to pricing, because we're not seeing any direct pressure this year, we're comfortable with our pricing strategy through to the end of '21 and the merchants are working with the supply team on any potential changes that we may need to implement moving into '22. But we're constantly evaluating our range, looking at the new innovation coming and pricing accordingly to drive the best value for our guests. Paul Lejuez : Got it. And can you just talk about your ability to chase product. Just given some supply chain constraints that were mentioned, I'm just curious how quickly you can get back into product. Meghan Frank : Yes, definitely. So inventory was certainly one area where we postured to drive for growth, both throughout 2020 as we navigated the pandemic and then into 2021. The team has been really proactive in strategically leveraging air freight to meet guest demand. And we do have the ability to chase categories and keeping a close eye on what's going on with the supply chain, but we feel really well positioned to navigate through this year and meet guest demand. Operator : The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : I wanted to just ask the question Matt asked, but a slightly different way. As consumers are starting to emerge and go out, are you seeing a shift in the kinds of products they're buying, let's say, particularly in the April, May time frame? And then a question for Meghan on SG&A. Obviously, this year, you've given some guidance color, which is super helpful, and you're looking for some deleverage relative to 2019 for MIRROR and the other factors that you cited. I'm just wondering if we should think about you starting to leverage SG&A beginning in 2022, if that's a realistic expectation. And I'm just trying to sort through the COVID cost here this year to understand how much of the COVID costs will not recur in 2022? And I think you're putting some store payroll that will be recurring into your COVID costs. So if you could maybe separate that out for us, that would be helpful. Calvin McDonald : Kimberly, I'll go first and just pick up on the first question. We have not seen a meaningful shift in our active wear categories through the first quarter. As you know, a big piece of our business and sales are in core. It's in athletic active wear. And I think with that, it has an embedded strength to not be purely trend-driven or fashion-driven. He and she are responding well to color. The team's done a wonderful job in introducing color into these core franchises in silhouettes. But our active wear sweats, shorts and tops have really been the uptick in momentum. But overall, the growth is across almost every category equally and very balanced across geographies. Meghan Frank : Kimberly, I'll take the second part of that question. So in terms of SG&A, we're expecting for the full year 30 to 50 basis points of deleverage, which is better than our prior expectation of 50 to 100 basis points. And that deleverage is really driven by consolidation of MIRROR for the full year as well as investment behind that business. And then a rebalancing of investments we did in 2020 into 2021, with the acceleration of our e-commerce business, which the expenses are attributed to SG&A and some pullback on the store side of which occupancy sits up in gross margin. We're really focused on managing the business from a bottom-line perspective and managing operating profit in excess of sales growth. We are not going to break out the COVID cost specifically, but really remain committed to managing to that operating profit in excess of sales growth over the longer term. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask a follow-up on the real estate, the decision to accelerate some of those new store openings. What's giving you the confidence there? Is it real estate opportunities? Is it market opportunities? Are you going to use the newer kind of bigger store format that has more room for men? Is the primary format you're using? And then I have a follow-up on MIRROR. Calvin McDonald : Great. Okay, Omar, let me address the first. I think it's a combination of all the above. We've stated and remain very confident in our store business, in its performance, in its contribution and the role it plays of connecting the brand, guest acquisition and driving productivity numbers. And we've seen nothing through the pandemic and emerging coming out that would get us off of that position. We equally are very early in every market in our store fleet rollout. So we do have opportunity for growth in every market, including Canada and the U.S. as well as internationally. So we apply a conservative number on an annual basis, and we are being opportunistic as a result with the opportunities in around the globe where we're getting key locations with the right size in key cities and markets as a result of opportunities that are coming our way. And we're capturing them because we believe in them. And in that, it is our newer models that allow for more of a men and expression, but it's not significantly above sort of our sweet spot of stores, and it does vary by market, in the 3,000 to 4,000 range or the 5,000 to 6,000 range in North America, but it depends on the city and the location, but very -- still confident in our store business. Omar Saad : Got it. And then on MIRROR, I just want to do a quick follow-up on MIRROR. Who is buying MIRROR? Is it -- are you seeing a consistent use case? Is it people who already have a home gym and they're mack daddy-ing it out with adding MIRROR to it? Or is it people who are trying to squeeze in with their existing space and it's such an efficient kind of interactive home workout solution? I'd love some color there. Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, for sure. And I'd say it's -- again, it's all the above. We're seeing individuals that have a number of at-home fitness solutions, and they add MIRROR as a versatile workout solution to round that out. And it definitely caters well to individuals that don't have a distinct gym, who may not have a stud to attach a device to and want something that can function both in a space that is versatile and sweat. And we're equally seeing a nice overlap with lululemon guests, but interestingly, a large number of non-lululemon guests owning MIRROR. So that's where we get excited as we as we build out the synergies of having a lululemon guest buy into a MIRROR and have the MIRROR guest buy into lululemon as their sweat solutions. But there is really a versatility in who's buying it, how they're using it. And the fundamental opportunity is unlocking these synergies, which we're just getting started as we're able to tap into the stores now that we're emerging out of the pandemic and drive the awareness for the product. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : So hey, sorry about that. Congrats on the big guidance increase in the top and bottom line. I guess, Meghan, if you look at where the business is operating from a P&L perspective, if I were to take out the high end of MIRROR revenue guidance and maybe the midpoint of the dilution, you'd be somewhere around a 23% operating margin, which -- for the core business, which is above -- comfortably above where it was in 2019. Can you just talk to the long-term upside to the margin potential for the core business, particularly as the store level margins, which you talked about earlier, recover to previous levels? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, John. So as you mentioned, we are headed towards a very healthy operating margin for lululemon-only for the full year, which is in line really with our Analyst Day expectations of operating profit and growth in excess of sales growth. We're really focused on managing that for the long term. And as we look towards the future, investing behind growth opportunities in order to maximize our top and bottom line. So we're maintaining that commitment, and we are firmly on track to those Analyst Day targets, which were really grounded in growth rates. So we'll continue on that trajectory, and we'll update our beyond 2023 plans at the appropriate time. Operator : That is all the time that we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions]. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Cal. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Our momentum continued into this quarter and our results remained robust with revenue growing more than 60% when compared to the same period last year. And on a 2-year CAGR basis, we are pleased to see an acceleration relative to our first quarter. These results reflect the ongoing strength across all major areas of the business. Our stores continued to rebound, generating a 2-year revenue CAGR of 9%, which is ahead of our expectations. We delivered positive growth in e-commerce, which is even more impressive given the strong performance 1 year ago. And we continue to deliver at a high level across all major categories and geographies. I also want to give some context around these numbers in the quarter after quarter performance we have been delivering. We are updating our guidance for the full year and based upon this revised forecast, I am pleased to share that we will surpass our 2023 revenue target by the end of this year, 2 years ahead of schedule. And we achieved these results based upon our performance before, during and as we emerge from COVID-19. A few more details related to these results. In 2020, we achieved our goal to double our e-commerce business. This year, we will likely achieve the goal we set to double our men's business. and we remain on track to quadruple our international business by 2023, if not sooner. I am proud of our leaders and teams for enabling us to meet and exceed these goals. As I've said before, lululemon remains in the early innings of our growth story, and I continue to be inspired and excited with the momentum we're seeing across the business. Results of this caliber enable us to now develop our next 5-year growth plan, and we'll come back to you next year with an updated view of what the future can hold for lululemon. Looking at the second quarter, our results reflected broad-based strength across our channels, regions and product categories. A few key metrics tell the story. First, we grew total revenue 28% on a 2-year CAGR basis to $1.5 billion. This growth rate continues to outpace our 3-year CAGR of 19% leading up to the pandemic and also represents an acceleration from the 25% 2-year CAGR we reported in quarter 1 of this year. In addition, our revenue increased across each of our major regions, up 26% in North America, and up 43% in our international markets, both on a 2-year CAGR basis. Second, we saw a further improvement in our brick-and-mortar channel with open stores generating productivity in line with 2019. I'm very pleased to achieve this milestone faster than we anticipated. Third, even with the recovery in our stores, our e-commerce business remains solid. Comps increased 4% on top of the 157% increase last year. And finally, I am pleased to share that our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.65 versus $0.96 in 2019, which is significantly ahead of our expectations. Let me now share more color on our second quarter results, starting with product innovation. From a performance standpoint, our momentum continued across categories with women's revenue increasing 26% and men's growing 31% on a 2-year CAGR basis. From a product standpoint, I'd like to take a moment to highlight 2 key launches : the AirSupport Bra and our latest yoga franchise, Instill. Bras remain an important expansion opportunity for us, thanks to our unique innovations across both fabrics and construction and powered by our proprietary research, we're very excited about our product positioning, and we know that bras is a wonderful category to drive loyalty with our guests. Currently, the category represents mid-single digit penetration, and we see an opportunity to grow this category into the low to mid-teens in the coming years. This quarter, we launched the AirSupport Bra, our most tested bra to date, which was developed following 5 years of advanced research and development. It's made from a proprietary Ultralu fabric and expands our offering into the high-impact training category. As I've mentioned before, lululemon's unique approach to product innovation is driven by our Science of Feel innovation platform. With this strategy firmly in place, we've introduced fabrics and products that engineer specific on-body sensations. Our popular aligned franchise offers our most distraction-free and weightless sensation, and we've expanded to include tops and bras in addition to our popular type. Just last week, we continued to build out our yoga offering through the introduction of the Instill franchise. Made from our newest innovation and technical performance fabric called SmoothCover, this fabric offers our Hugged Sensation, which provides incredible support through every pose in your practice. It's a powerful and distinctive companion to our hugely successful Align product line and we will further solidify our leadership position within the yoga category. Last October, we launched our Impact Agenda, which outlines our strategies to address critical social and environmental issues over a multiyear period. I'm proud of our recent announcements to develop advanced raw materials that will help us live into our goals and create a healthier world. These include our participation in the Mylo Consortium that will allow us to make products using an infinitely renewable material made from the root structure of mushrooms. We expect to launch our first products using Mylo next year. Our partnership with LanzaTech, a biotech company, which allows us to create the world's first yarn and fabric using recycled carbon emissions. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our multiyear collaboration with Genomatica, a recognized leader in sustainable materials to create a lower impact plant-based nylon. I'm excited with these 3 new partnerships, and it's just the beginning of lululemon's commitment to be a leader in the industry related to product sustainability and innovation. I would now like to speak to our supply chain and the issues facing the entire industry. Another wave of COVID-19 and related factory closures in Vietnam, ongoing issues at the ports and reduced airfreight capacity are contributing to some disruptions within the supply chain as well as increased costs. We are monitoring this closely and leaning into the agility of our supply chain, the strength of our planning and allocations team and the powerful partnerships with our vendors to help mitigate the risks where we can. Our business was particularly strong in quarter 2, and our guidance calls for momentum to continue in the back half of the year. But I think it's fair to say that our business would have been even stronger without these challenges facing the industry. Meghan will have more to share regarding inventory and costs in a few moments. Let me now shift to MIRROR. We continue to be pleased with the performance of MIRROR, and let me highlight several initiatives we have on track for this year. We now have MIRROR shop-in-shops in 150 lululemon stores and our plans call for 200 shops in time for the holiday season. We will soon introduce MIRROR to guests in Canada where lululemon has an impressive level of recognition. We recently opened our second production studio in New York, allowing us to double the number of live classes. And MIRROR will launch a new e-commerce site in time for the holiday season this year. We are monitoring how macro factors currently impacting the cost of digital marketing are creating some pressure on customer acquisition costs at MIRROR. We're enthusiastic about the opportunities that exist for the business. We'll continue monitoring the rising costs associated with CAC while we move ahead with launching exciting new innovations and leveraging the synergies lululemon brings to the relationship. Combined, these give us a unique strength to keep growing MIRROR. We will be competitive to attract new members, and we will continue to take a measured and responsible approach to the business. We are playing the long game and have much to unlock in the coming years. We're also excited about how MIRROR can be the vehicle through which we offer long-term benefits to our guests such as membership programs and special experiences. Given this strategic opportunity, we will suspend our membership test that has been underway and apply the learnings to how we build out the MIRROR platform for guests. The learnings from our membership tests are considerable. Some examples include digital sweat classes and community events were top drivers of overall program engagement. Guests want to engage deeper with us in each other, and they are willing to shift into the digital space to do so, and the program was embraced by men at a higher rate than we were expecting. These learnings were integral to our decision to complete the MIRROR acquisition and hold true today. We look forward to sharing more with you on the evolution of our loyalty programs at a later date. Switching now to international. Our sales trends continue to be robust with all major regions generating strong double-digit sales growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. We opened 8 stores outside of North America in quarter 2 and remain on track to open 35 to 40 stores this year internationally. As you know, we also see continued growth opportunities within North America and I am pleased to now hand it over to Celeste, who will share some additional details with you on our stores and e-commerce business. Celeste? Celeste Burgoyne : Thank you, Calvin. I'm happy to be on the call today to speak to our omni guest experience pillar and to share some additional details on our second quarter performance. Looking at our store channel. Total revenue increased 142% versus last year and 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Traffic was strong and increased over 150% versus last year. In addition, I am thrilled that we are able to achieve productivity in our open stores equal to levels we saw in 2019 and happy to see these results sooner than we expected. This performance not only speaks to the success of our kick-starting our stores initiative and the strength of our merchandise assortment, but it also speaks to our educators and store teams who bring our brand to life every day for our guests. Now let me take a moment to share with you a few highlights from several exciting community activations we recently hosted throughout the quarter. In Atlanta, we cohosted a charity event created in partnership with leading Atlanta fitness influencers, [ Macaday ] and [ EJ Houston ]. Guests took 3 back-to-back classes and lululemon matched all ticket sales, which were then donated to the Black Women's Health Imperative. In Chicago, beginning in July and running through October, lululemon is partnering with Urban Juncture Foundation to host a community pop-up on Chicago's south side in the Boxville Marketplace. Boxville is a very unique collection of shipping containers designed as a space for the community to gather and local businesses to engage in commerce. Our activation pairs our ambassadors with fitness instructors in the local community to lead over 140 complementary fitness classes. The turnout for these classes had been really positive. And I'm really excited that we're celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our iconic series event with a virtual run later this month. We are really proud to be able to bring the lululemon brand to our guests in these unique and compelling ways and we are excited about what is yet to come. Switching now to e-commerce. As Calvin mentioned, sales trends remain positive, with total digital comps up 4% in Q2. This result comes on top of the 157% increase in Q2 of last year, which benefited from our online warehouse sale, an event that we did not repeat this year. The enhancements we're continuing to make to our desktop and mobile sites, which include expanding our alternative payment methods, improved storytelling, more predictive search and a more seamless checkout, all combined to continue to elevate the online guest experience. Before I hand it over to Meghan, I'd like to speak for a minute on labor and what we're seeing regarding store and call center staffing. We have always supported and invested in our people. This was never more true than last year during the pandemic. We prioritized our people and kept our teams intact by offering pay production, sick pay and other key people investments. Not only were these initiatives the right thing to do for our people, but they kept our workforce whole and have enabled us to reopen stores with a full complement of educators and leadership teams. And they are directly contributing to the strong results we've generated over the last several quarters. That being said, we are carefully monitoring the current developments in labor markets, particularly in North America, and we remain committed to doing what's right for store and DC teams. We've recently announced that we will raise the minimum base pay for our store and guest education center roles in North America, taking our new base pay to $15 to $17 per hour, depending on the location enroll plus all levels are eligible for a monthly bonus on top of base pay. Our teams are incredibly deserving of this new rate, and we feel it sets us up strongly going into what will be a busy Q4. In closing, I'd like to thank the entire lululemon family, especially our teams in stores and our guest education center and in our distribution centers around the world. These teams are the heart and soul of our brand, and they are responsible for the elevated experience our guests enjoy each and every time they engage with us. We are so grateful for everyone's hard work and dedication. And for that, I'd like to say thank you. I will now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Celeste. Our momentum continued in Q2 with our top and bottom line results exceeding our expectations. Strong guest response to our merchandise offering and improving store trend and continued strength in e-commerce fueled our growth, and contributed to our increased outlook for the year, which I will take you through in a moment. As Calvin mentioned, we continue to navigate industry-wide challenges with COVID-related factory closures, slowdowns at the ports and reduced airfreight capacity impacting our business as we move into the second half of the year. I'll share some of the specific impacts of these issues with you as I take you through our Q2 financials and our guidance. Despite these headwinds, we expect both strong revenue and EPS for the year and we remain on track to deliver or in some cases, even exceed our goals as set forth in our Power of Three growth plan. Let me now share with you the details of our Q2 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR but exclude approximately $8.1 million of acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect in Q2 2021. And $11.5 million of acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effects in Q2 2020. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q2, total net revenue increased 61% to $1.5 billion, above our expectations of $1.3 billion to $1.33 billion. This included a 63% increase in North America and a 49% increase in our international business. On a 2-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 28% with North America up 26% and international increasing 43%. In our digital channel, revenues increased 66% on a 2-year CAGR basis, above our expectations of approximately 55% growth. E-com contributed $597 million of top line or 41% of total revenue. In our store channel, sales increased 9% on a 2-year CAGR basis, above our expectations of approximately flat. Productivity in stores returned to 2019 levels, representing continued improvement versus 88% productivity we realized in Q1 of this year. At the end of the second quarter, we had 95% of our stores open. Square footage increased 8% versus last year, driven by the addition of 28 net new stores since Q2 of 2020. During the quarter, we opened 11 net new stores. Gross profit for the second quarter was $843 million or 58.1% of net revenue compared to 54.2% of net revenue in Q2 2020 and 55% of net revenue in Q2 2019. Our gross margin increase of 310 basis points relative to 2019 was driven by 290 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation and product team costs and 60 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange, which was partially offset by a 40 basis point decrease in product margin, driven by a 120 basis point increase in airfreight related to COVID-19. I would also note that markdowns decline relative to 2019. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $541 million or 37.3% of net revenue compared to 39.1% of net revenue in Q2 2020 and 36% of net revenue in Q2 2019. Leverage in the quarter versus Q2 2020 resulted from a sales increase relative to the COVID impacted quarter last year. The deleverage relative to Q2 2019 is the result of consolidation of MIRROR's results this year, but not in 2019 and deleverage on foreign exchange. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $299 million or 20.6% of net revenue compared to 15% of net revenue in Q2 2020 and 19% of net revenue in Q2 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $83.5 million or 27.9% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.9% a year ago. The reduction relative to last year is due primarily to deductions related to stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $216 million or $1.65 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.74 in Q2 of 2020 and $0.96 in Q2 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $80 million for the quarter compared to $53 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, supply chain investment and technology spend to support our business growth. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of total liquidity. We had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 17% versus last year, and was $790 million at the end of Q2. This is below our expectations for a 25% to 30% increase due to our top line outperformance, coupled with industry-wide supply chain disruptions. However, on a 2-year CAGR basis, this represents inventory growth of 26% versus our expectation for 24% to 25% revenue growth in Q3 on a 2-year CAGR basis. As we've mentioned, we are seeing some delayed inventory receipts due to issues of the ports and also the recent COVID-related closures of certain factories in Southern Vietnam. Our supply chain and product teams are working diligently to mitigate these risks by shifting production out of Vietnam, where possible with our vendors who operate in multiple countries, prioritizing production to ensure key fall holiday styles are produced first and strategically increasing our use of airfreight. At the end of Q3, we expect inventory levels to increase approximately 15% to 20% relative to Q3 2020. While this level of inventory can support our increased revenue guidance, I'm going to walk through in a moment, it is lower than we had initially targeted due to supply chain challenges. In Q2, we repurchased 506,000 shares at an average price of $338. At the end of the quarter, we had $245 million of availability remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Let me shift now to our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2021. The underlying demand for our brand is strong, and while we are navigating temporary headwinds in our supply chain, which are impacting both top line and gross margin, we are pleased with our momentum headed into the second half. We currently have approximately 95% of our stores opened globally. We're engaging with guests inside our stores and through our community activations and our e-commerce business remains strong. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.43 billion, representing a 2-year CAGR of 24% to 25%. We expect gross margin in Q3 to increase 50 to 100 basis points versus Q3 of 2019. Relative to 2019, our gross margin is benefiting from a higher e-com penetration and leverage on occupancy and depreciation. Our Q3 guidance reflects an impact of approximately 200 basis points of pressure from airfreight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. In Q3, we expect SG&A deleverage of approximately 300 to 350 basis points relative to 2019. Drivers of the deleverage versus 2019 include consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in 2019, increased investments in brand building to slower growth initiatives and higher depreciation due to accelerated investment to support e-commerce business in 2020 and 2021. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38 versus adjusted EPS of $1.16 a year ago. This includes operating results from MIRROR but excludes acquisition and integration-related costs. As a reminder, we reported EPS of $0.96 in Q3 of 2019. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.19 billion to $6.26 billion. This range now assumes our e-commerce business grows in the mid-teens relative to the outsized strength we experienced in 2020. Our annual range also assumes the factories we use to source product in Vietnam begin a phase reopening in mid-September. When looking at total revenue, our guidance range implies a 2-year CAGR of approximately 25%, which is higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and is well ahead of the low teens CAGR we contemplated in our Power of Three growth plan. We continue to expect to open 45 to 55 net new company-operated stores in 2021. This includes approximately 35 to 40 stores that are international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the low teens. We continue to expect gross margin for the year to expand between 150 to 200 basis points compared to the modest increase we saw in 2020. For the year, the anticipated margin expansion now includes 150 to 200 basis points of negative impact from additional airfreight costs, but is still in excess of Power of Three growth plan, which assumes modest gross margin expansion annually. When looking at SG&A for the full year, we now expect deleverage of 10 to 30 basis points versus 2020. Drivers of the deleverage continue to include our investment in MIRROR brand building. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year to be similar to 2020. We now expect our fiscal year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.38 to $7.48. Our EPS guidance continues to assume modest dilution from MIRROR in the 3% to 5% range, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs. It also excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $365 million to $375 million for 2021. The increase versus 2020 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations, including MIRROR shop-in-shops as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Before handing it back to Calvin, I want to express my gratitude to the entire lululemon collective. It is you who brings our brand to life every day and enables our strong financial results. And now back to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan and Celeste. Before I open it up to questions, I wanted to take a look back on these results in the previous quarters and speak for a moment about the unique business model that drives our success, enables our strong performance and allows us to navigate COVID-19 and the current headwinds impacting our supply chain. Our vertically integrated model and high-margin structure allows us to use more airfreight while still delivering gross margin expansion. Our focus on technical athletic apparel allows us to benefit from trends in consumer behavior that are becoming more important year after year and our inventory, which leverages many key core styles with less seasonality helps us navigate and mitigate disruptions within the supply chain. Looking at our business over the course of the second quarter and the first half of the year, I continue to be excited about our day-to-day progress, our ability to sustain momentum quarter after quarter and year after year and the incredible long-term prospects for our brand. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations. I mean these are just really stellar results. I mean so much is going on, right, so many puts and takes. And I guess the question is with lead times that are generally, let's call 6 months plus, I'm wondering if you can give us some more details on the amount of exposure that you have maybe to Vietnam. Is it really just products coming out of that country? Or is it bleeding into the region? And though you're going to airfreight products, is that airfreight for [ old style ] or the airfreight to potentially meet holiday demand? Meghan Frank : It's Meghan. I'll actually take that. So in terms of Vietnam, we sourced approximately 30% of our finished goods and the impact of the Southern Vietnam closure is currently impacting approximately 20% of our second half inventory. We are leveraging airfreight to meet our guidance. And what's contemplated in our guidance is 150 to 200 basis points of deleverage for the full year in terms of airfreight impact. To the extent possible, the team is looking to multisource and leverage other countries as well as prioritize fall holiday key styles to the best of their ability, and airfreight is a muscle that as a growth company, we often leverage, and we continue to do so as we navigate the supply chain challenges in the second half. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Congrats on the results here. So great to hear you're on track to pass the 2023 revenue target sooner than anticipated. Understanding we'll be hearing more next year, but just any initial thoughts you can share on how we should be thinking about your top line growth algorithm beyond 2021 and how, if at all, the drivers may change versus the prior plan. Calvin McDonald : Mark, thanks. And as you mentioned, with the revised guidance, we're looking to achieve between $6.2 billion, $6.3 billion this year, putting us 2 years ahead. We achieved doubling our e-commerce business last year. We will double our men's business this year and our international business is ahead of the 4x growth we put out to be completed by the end of '23. So it really supports the early innings and growth across multiple levers. The Power of Three initiatives focusing on product, guest experience and market expansion are still the key areas of focus that we will drive our innovation through and, the growth targets within that is what you should continue to look forward beyond '21. But we do plan to come back with our long-term thinking next year and share more with you at that point. Mark Altschwager : And Calvin, just a quick follow-up. Can you expand a little bit on the plans for membership? I guess I imagine it was a challenge to get reads on the tests given everything that's been going on in the last 18 months. But do you still see an opportunity to have a loyalty program that exists outside of the MIRROR platform? Or what form might that take? Calvin McDonald : Great. Yes. No, absolutely, Mark, and thanks for the question. I'll break it into 2 things. One, the membership test, we learned a lot. In particular, the way the test was set up, as you know, is it was a paid membership program and our guests received a number of benefits linked to sweat. And from that, some of the behaviors that we were able to observe was how it drove brand love, their connection to the community, both the brand as well as to each other, which is really important, and you want that in these type of membership programs to drive that loyalty, any impact on their spend. And in fact, those behaviors is what gave us the conviction and confidence to go ahead with the MIRROR acquisition because we saw a natural synergy between the two, a paid membership program focused on sweat. And the membership tests although very effective, the challenge, COVID aside, was that it was challenged to scale. It was rooted and physical, and we couldn't offer it everywhere. And we always had visions of being able to bring that to the digital platform. And seeing what we saw within the physical and our relationship with the MIRROR team gave us the confidence to proceed with that. And really, we always saw a convergence between these 2 strategies. The membership test gave us access to thousands of guests that we're behaving in this way and MIRROR at the end of this year is going to give us access to hundreds of thousands. And we're excited about the ability to scale it. We're early. We're thinking long term, and that convergence was natural. Outside of a paid subscription, the opportunity around loyalty absolutely exists, and it's something that we will share later as we share our plans for the future. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : I wanted to follow up on the international business and the momentum that you're seeing there. Can you provide some additional insight about what's working really well in those geographies? And perhaps a little bit more detail on your outlook for China momentum into the second half. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thank you, Brooke. Very pleased with our international business. Very pleased with growth across every market we are in. Now different markets have impacted -- have been impacted differently from COVID. As you know, Australia, New Zealand, in particular right now is where the bulk of our global store closures are taking place. But even with that, our online business is doing very well. So overall, what's very exciting is the balance of growth across all international markets, meaning they are all contributing significant growth and into our goal of quadrupling our international business by '23. China, in particular, is a market where we have leaned in on an investment. We've opened a head office in Shanghai. We are leaning in, in hiring and supporting local teams within that market and in our store expansion as well as our digital innovation and support. So China is definitely one of our key markets. We are seeing good growth. We are investing in the country, supporting the teams and overall, the international business like our business in North America, and some of our category opportunities very early and growth across all channels in the markets and product categories. So excited about what the future continues to hold for our international business. Brooke Roach : And if I could just follow up with a question from Meghan on the SG&A leverage outlook. There are a lot of moving pieces within the outlook, some investments in brand building, higher wages. Can you help us think through some of the puts and takes of that leverage component and SG&A into the back half of this year? Meghan Frank : Yes. So in terms of SG&A, we guided for Q3 to 300 to 350 basis points deleverage relative to 2019. So -- and that includes MIRROR consolidated in this year's numbers and not in 2019 as well as brand building, which should include both that MIRROR piece as well as our current field campaign. And then we also have higher depreciation relative to 2019, just given our investments behind digital and the strength of that business. When we look at the full year, we've got 10 to 30 basis points of deleverage for -- relative to 2020, and that is better than the 30 to 50 basis points that we disclosed previously. And really driving that deleverage would be the consolidation of MIRROR for the full year as well as investments again behind our digital channel. But really pleased overall, I would say, with the operating flow-through of our business and remain on track to our Power of Three growth plan, as we've discussed. Operator : The next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Let me add my congratulations, excellent results. I have a follow-up first on the supply chain. Just as you look forward, could you just talk about if you see any of the current issues bleeding into spring? And when do some of the facilities that have currently been shuttered in Vietnam, need to start kind of ramping to hit kind of later holiday demand as well as spring? And then secondly for Meghan, on the second quarter comment you called out on open store productivity back at 2019 levels. How are you planning that for the back half? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Erinn. So in terms of supply chain, we are assuming that Southern Vietnam begins a phased reopening in mid-September, and that's what's implied in our guidance. Closely monitoring the situation at this point, we do anticipate that the airfreight environment will not improve for the balance of the year. And thus, we've guided to the 150 to 200 basis points impact for this year, and we'll continue to update you as we move into '22. And then in terms of open store productivity, can you just remind me of the details to your question there? Erinn Murphy : I was just curious, you said you were back in 2019 levels in the second quarter, which was ahead of plan. How are you planning store productivity for open stores in the back half? Meghan Frank : So for Q3, we are planning to be slightly above last year 2019 levels for the quarter. When we look to Q4, we're really pushing into our omnichannel strength and will be agile across both channels, meaning the demand where it comes to us, but we are sharing slightly above 2019 productivity for Q3. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Let me add my congrats. Great results. Calvin or Meghan, I guess, can you elaborate a little bit on the CAC commentary you gave. Can you just talk about the idea if changes and how it's impacted MIRROR? Are the opt-in rates a little bit lower than what you had expected? Is this kind of what you thought? And then I guess just to wrap that question up, how does this impact the concept's ability to reach breakeven? Does it kind of push it out a little bit more? Do you view this as transitory? Just any color around that would be really helpful. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Ike. I'll handle the first half and then handle the second part to your question on breakeven over to Meghan. I continue to be very encouraged with the usage numbers and engagement numbers that we're seeing with the MIRROR community. And I'll start there because I think those to me are the most important and signal the health and the engagement of the community, both with each other as well as near the product. And we continue to see the members use of MIRROR, number of sweats, number of members per household sweating increase and hold very high numbers. So very excited about how any guests, any member that purchases it, is using it and all the things we love about the versatility, the genre and the appeal to a number are all playing out as well as our conversion numbers are very healthy. The challenge right now with a variety of changes that have happened in the digital marketing space is the cost CPM, the cost to get MIRROR, which has low awareness right now, and we're working towards in front of guests. Those costs in the market are rising, which has an impact ultimately into CAC. But the number of guests that are converting when they see those ads and ultimately convert to buy once they work their way down through the funnel are all at or above where we've been trending and very healthy. So it is a reflection of the industry. We are, as I mentioned, managing accordingly. We have our eyes on the long game with MIRROR and the community we're building. We're just ramping up synergies like the 200 stores that play to our strength and the key leads in each of those locations. So we're excited heading into the holiday, but I did want to call it out because we're monitoring it. And as I mentioned, we're going to stay within the guidance we gave on dilution, and we're going to leverage the strength of the synergy and learn a ton this holiday. But the general metrics and guest member usage are very, very strong. Meghan Frank : In terms of breakeven, we haven't put a fine point on that, but we are focused, as Calvin mentioned, on rolling out initiatives for 2021, including store ramp, Canada entry and e-commerce website rebound. The path to profitability there for MIRROR is very much within our control, and we're investing behind the strength and momentum in that business as well as our overall financial strength. And we'll share more as we move through the peak holiday season and into '22. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Let me add my congrats on a really nice quarter. Two quick ones, I guess, on gross margin sustainability. The gross margins in 2Q are above what you typically do for holiday quarter pre-COVID, which is where there's a lot of leverage in the business. Can you talk about your confidence in sustaining this level beyond the recovery period? And what we should think about as the puts and takes for gross margin just thematically as we look out beyond '21? And then, Calvin, on international, when we gathered to the Analyst Day and you gave us the initial guidance of quadrupling revenues by 2023, I think the comment was that international was going to reach breakeven in 2018 and would be 10% to 15% of earnings by 2023. So I think that embedded about 1,000 to 1,500 basis points of margin expansion in international. You told us tonight you're on track to quadruple the revenues. But maybe you could just give us some thoughts on the path of the profitability of the international business to go with that comment just to bring us up to date. Meghan Frank : Mike, I'll take the first part of that question. So in terms of gross margin, 150 basis points to 200 basis points expansion was where we guided for the full year. And we're pleased, I would say, overall, with that relative to 2020 performance. It's really driven through our performance on top line and leverage on occupancy and depreciation. And then we do, at this point in time, we're maintaining our Power of Three growth plan, which calls for modest expansion in gross margin as we look out. And as Calvin mentioned, we'll come back and update that plan as we move into next year.  And in terms of overall international profitability, we are profitable overall in international. And still see a lot of opportunity there relative to the maturation of the international business in terms of its comparison to North America, particularly pleased with the growth rate we're experiencing in China and see opportunity for both revenue and gross margin expansion and operating margin as that business expands. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to focus on the men's business for a minute. The 2-year CAGR continues to accelerate. I was just curious where you've seen success and then what you're excited about for the back half and into next year vis-a-vis then? Calvin McDonald : Lorraine, it's Calvin. As you alluded, we're very happy with the overall growth in our men's business to your CAGR of 31%. I'm sure you remember last year when heading into COVID, our men's business was leading growth over women's. And then with the shutting of our stores and other shifts that were happening as a result, we saw that business slow both in the industry as well as with ourselves, even though we were putting on market share. And at the time I sort of indicated that it would just be a matter of time. We didn't see anything systemic in our men's business that raised any concerns for us. And those scenarios played out as stores opened. He came back into the store, which stores still remain a wonderful acquisition vehicle for us to get new men into the business and into the brand. And it has just continued to gain momentum through each quarter and then with Q2 being sort of back at that great growth where we're going to double our business at the end of this year, 2 years early from when we started at the beginning of 2019. And when I look at the growth, it did balance across all the categories, which is very healthy. They're obviously between bottoms and tops and shorts and outerwear and some of the accessories, you see a slight variance in growth. But overall, they're all double digit, all very, very strong, and it's a reflection of building deeper relationships with our existing guys and spending more and continuing to acquire and bring in a new male guest into the business. And we will share the role men's plays in our future growth plans early next year when we sort of reset. But it continues to be very strong, very strong across all markets around the globe. And it's driven both by current spending more and our acquisition of new guests. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter. So maybe, Calvin, as we think about 28% revenue growth relative to 2019 in the second quarter, mid-20s in the first quarter, is there a way to rank the drivers of the outperformance that you're seeing relative to that 19% pre-pandemic? Or maybe said differently, do you believe the TAM coming out of this crisis is larger, broadly multiyear for the lulu brand? Or are you taking accelerated market share? Or is it a combination of both? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. It's definitely a combination of both. We've shared and continue to see our brand gaining market share across categories, men's and women's. Equally, we know that the pandemic drove forward, accelerated some of the guest behaviors that played the strength of our brand. One is general fitness awareness to being well, living well to the importance of functional apparel, which is critical and again, plays to our strength. And third is really the roles in categories that our brand play in and how the guests are wearing and using the gear. So I think the -- I know the TAM has been impacted by those macro trends. We're well positioned within that TAM to address it in a very effective, leading way. And I think that, combined with our ability to gain market share against our competitors is helping to fuel the business and will continue as we look forward to the years. And you've heard me say this before, this brand is early innings across product with activities where we focus on run, train, yoga and OTM categories within those activities and both our men's and women's business, markets, North American international and channels, online and stores. So we are early innings in our growth. That's why we see such balanced growth across markets, channels and product categories. And the impact that COVID has had on TAM plays to the strengths and plays to our growth story and the opportunity that we see ahead for our brand. Matthew Boss : Great. Congrats again, early innings is a great thing. Calvin McDonald : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Calvin, I just wanted to follow up on that last answer. There's some large public companies who have bought athleisure brands over the past couple of months. Just wondering how you think that impacts the company's ability to continue to reach its goals. And can you remind us what is it about lululemon that continues to allow you to be a leader when a lot of other companies are going to be -- big companies with big resources are going to be making investments in this category. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Jay. There's a lot in that question, and I'll unpack a bit of it. But those brands that have been acquired have been in the market. We've competed against them before, and we've always liked our unique in differentiation within what has been a crowded marketplace, and yet we continue to put up the results we've put up in the past number of years. And that really is rooted in a number of very unique attributes to our brand, one, starting with our product, the premium nature of it, the focus and obsession on innovation through Science of Feel that truly creates product that performs in a unique way to the guest and provides a sensorial experience that's unique and different with the quality that they know they're getting for what they buy and pay. And that has always driven our business. It's what separates us from others and I don't see that changing with the landscape of who's out there and who owns who's out there. Our obsession with raw material and our investment in our product is what we do. It's what we obsess about. And it's really what drives why the guests feel different and continue to sort of be loyal to this product and brand. And the second is the power of human connection through our educators to the strength of our community and the investments we make at grassroots through our people, through our ambassador community and then the exciting addition of MIRROR into that community. But everything we do around human connection, Science of Feel that's fueling that continues to differentiate the brand and its unique position as premium, but through quality innovation. We believe continue to be unique differentiators and drivers of the brand and have obviously been in place and fueled the growth that we've seen so far. Jay Sole : Got it. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more question, switching gears for a second. If we think about the holiday environment, Calvin, how are you thinking about maybe some opportunities that could be presented around pricing if we are in an environment where a lot of companies are having trouble sourcing the units they need or they would want to really fulfill the demand -- the consumer demand that's out there. Does it create opportunity to take some pricing to offset cost increases, whether it's in labor or other areas? And how do you think that the overall environment will respond to a situation where everybody is being challenged by supply chain issues in Asia. Calvin McDonald : Yes. We take pricing obviously, seriously and that we're constantly monitoring and testing, driven out of the innovation of the product. We're well aware of the inputs of inflation and costs and have that in our guidance that Meghan has provided. We look for opportunities, both where we could price up and/or price down to be positioned in the marketplace based on assortment and range work. So it's pretty fluid, Matt, and we're comfortable -- sorry, Jay, very fluid and we're comfortable with sort of how we're positioned today in addressing it, but all and any pricing changes would be in Meghan's guidance, and there's nothing of significant plan or that you should expect. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Congrats on all the momentum. Calvin, can you talk about the investments in renewable materials and the stance on sustainability that you're taking. How much of a percentage of the assortment can this represent over time? How is the margin profile of the sustainable product look versus the current assortment? And I have a quick follow-up for Meghan. Calvin McDonald : Good. Thanks, John. As you know, in our Impact Agenda that we published our first one last year on our \"be human, be well, be planet\" pillars. In our be planet, our commitment is to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials by 2030 as well as investing into circularity, which is extending the life of our products and providing options and choices to our guests. And there's been a lot of fantastic innovations and partnerships in that space with the pilot around our resell program, the partnerships, be it with Mylo, LanzaTech or Genomatica announced this past quarter in the super cluster. So it is a very important driver of innovation for our business. We've established plans to improve the planet that we're committed to. And as these scale and as we continue to drop collections and learn, we are not anticipating or how we factored in a margin pressure result. And we've established multiyear targets. We are working with the right partners to help in the manufacturing and the creation and therefore, the commercialization of these goods. So I would not factor in any marginal impact, and our goals speak for themselves. We want to be, by 2030, 100% of our products made with sustained materials, and that's what these partnerships are gearing and working towards for us. John Kernan : That's exciting things. Meghan, maybe just a quick follow-up on the increased outlook for airfreight. I think that everybody is seeing, I think it's now 150 to 200 basis point negative impact for the year. How should we think about this in terms of recovery? It seems like most of this is cyclical and much of this can be recovered fairly quickly as the supply chain begins to open up. Is that the right way to think about this, is that some -- the gross margin would obviously be a lot higher without some of these supply chain pressures and that some of this is just a cyclical rather than structural. Meghan Frank : Yes. I would say, definitely view it as temporary in nature. Obviously, the environment is really dynamic and fluid today. As I mentioned, we anticipate it will be with us for the balance of the year and we'll update on 2022. There will be some likely some puts and takes in margin as we move forward, and we do remain committed to the margin target that was in our Power of Three growth plan of modest expansion annually. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. I'm excited to be here to discuss our results and share highlights of our performance at the start of the holiday season.  Our momentum remained strong in the quarter, reflecting the continued growth potential for lululemon in both the near term and the long term. I'm especially pleased with how our leaders and teams continue to successfully execute against our Power of Three growth plan while we navigate the supply chain issues within the industry. Relative to last year, revenue grew 30% and on a 2-year CAGR basis, increased 26%.  Our strength continues to be broad-based and balanced across every facet of our business, including channel, category, activity, gender and geography. Before discussing more details about quarter 3, I would like to share some highlights on the 3 topics : our performance over the recent Thanksgiving holiday, inventory levels and the current labor market.  Starting with Thanksgiving, we were pleased with our performance over the holiday weekend. For the 5 days spanning Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, both our digital and brick-and-mortar channels performed well. E-commerce delivered record-breaking days in several key metrics, including sales, traffic and conversion. And I'm excited to share that this year, Thanksgiving Day was our highest-volume e-commerce day ever. The investments we have made over the last several years are enabling the acceleration we're seeing in the digital business and contributing to the growth this year on top of last year's outsized performance. While we still have several large volume weeks ahead of us, it was great to see our guests respond well to our merchandise offering as we kicked off the holiday season.  Shifting to our supply chain. We continue to face the same issues as much of the industry, including port slowdowns and increased costs associated with airfreight. In Vietnam, I am pleased to share that all of our factories have reopened and continued to ramp up their capacity. While the summer closures caused some delays, our total inventory at the end of Q3 was up 22%, slightly ahead of our most recent expectations of 15% to 20%.  As you are aware, approximately 40% of our inventory is comprised of core seasonless product which helps us make our inventory management and flow decisions. This coupled with the well-established partnerships we have with our vendors is allowing us to mitigate many of the current supply chain risks. I'm extremely proud of how our teams have and continue to successfully navigate through this dynamic environment. While we're comfortable with both the quality and quantity of our inventory, I continue to believe that demand for our brand is outpacing supply, and our business could have been even stronger without the supply chain challenges.  Turning to the labor market. We are well positioned this holiday to meet guest demand. As you know, the hiring environment has been very competitive this season, and I'm pleased that we have been able to hire more than 7,000 employees within our stores, DCs and guest education centers in the lead up to the holiday. Our strong employee offering, highlighted by our Pay Protection Program through COVID-19 and recent increases in minimum wage, has enabled us to perform well in the current environment.  Let me now share some highlights from our Q3 results. First, our total revenue of $1.5 billion represents growth of 26% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Second, we continue to build on the strength in our store channel with productivity levels above what we achieved in 2019. Third, our e-commerce business comped up 21%, which on top of the 93% last year, translates into a 2-year CAGR of 54%. And finally, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.62 versus $0.96 in 2019, which was above expectations. This level of performance continues to demonstrate how lululemon is a brand positioned for consistent growth quarter after quarter.  Next, I will provide some additional details on our results, starting with product innovation. Our momentum remains strong across all of our major categories, with women's revenue increasing 24%, men's growing 29% and accessories up 40%, all on a 2-year CAGR basis. We continue to leverage the Science of Feel to bring product newness and innovation to our guests. I'm particularly proud of our recently announced multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee. This is important to us in several ways. First, it allows us to showcase the lululemon brand and our technical expertise within apparel on the world stage. Next, it is a compelling platform that we can leverage to continue to grow our brand presence in Canada, our most mature market. And finally, it offers a new and exciting test and learn opportunity to increase our brand awareness and consideration with men, both inside and outside of Canada. Our product teams worked with athletes for 18 months and developed more than 30 styles to help each team member feel and perform their best during the games. As a Canadian and lifelong fan of the games, I want to share that all of us at lululemon are honored to play a role in helping to inspire and unite people through sport.  Let me now move on to MIRROR. Our core lululemon business continues to be strong. Driving innovation and growth in our core remains our primary focus, and our results demonstrate the ongoing effectiveness of our initiatives. This success allows us to invest in new opportunities to enable future growth, and MIRROR is one of those examples. Our vision for MIRROR is to assist in building and extending our lululemon community and helping us drive both retention and spend. It's an evolution of our membership program to propel our core business at lululemon, for lululemon. We have only just begun our journey with MIRROR, and we will continue to roll out initiatives that deliver on this goal.  As you know, 2021 has been a challenging year for digital fitness. And as I mentioned on our last earnings call, we have seen increasing pressures on CAC that are impacting the entire industry. One of the unique advantages we bring to the space is the many ways we can build brand awareness for MIRROR. As we unlock these synergies, we see a clear path to engage with the more than 10 million lululemon guests who live the sweat life.  We will not chase growth at any cost. We simply don't need to, but we will invest to define our unique proposition and to bring MIRROR to market through our owned marketing channels. We demonstrated this with our recent launch in Canada and the introduction of our innovative connected weights, both of which are off to a great start. We can and will stand out in a crowded space and leverage all that's unique about lululemon.  With this context, we are lowering our revenue guidance for MIRROR for the year to $125 million to $130 million. Given the seasonality of their business, which skews heavily to quarter 4, the timing of this revision is appropriate given the line of sight we have on its performance. Importantly, we are maintaining our dilution estimate of 3% to 5%. With this said, I'm pleased that we will have grown our subscribers by 40% year-over-year and will end 2021 with a meaningful subscription base to build upon. MIRROR represents less than 3% of our revenue this year. Although we do not require it to deliver our Power of Three goals, we see MIRROR as an opportunity to engage with our guests in new ways that we will continue to evolve and refine over time. We are still early in creating our vision of a loyalty community that captures the best of lululemon. This is not a sprint for us, and we will maintain a steady pace forward that realizes our vision. Switching now to our store channel. Total revenue increased 38% versus last year and 10% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Traffic increased over 50% versus last year. We're pleased with the start of the holiday season in stores, and our educators are thrilled to be engaging with the guests in person. We continue to leverage and enhance our in-store and omni capabilities, including enhancing our mobile app to facilitate curbside pickup for guests, make our in-store handheld units more intuitive for our educators to help speed guests through transactions and continue to offer our online digital educator service at no cost, providing a personal shopping experience for guests who can't make it into our stores. Turning to our e-commerce business. Sales trends remain robust with total digital comps up 21% in Q3. This result comes on top of the 93% increase in the same quarter last year. We continue to enhance the experience for our guests on our websites and apps, which is the direct result of the investments we have made over the last 18 months, and it is paying off for us.  For example, when I was in stores over Thanksgiving weekend, each store was doing an impressive volume of orders through both BOPUS and BBR. This is enabled by the visibility we have to our inventory across our network which allows us to meet guest demand and exceed their expectations. It's a great example of how we are realizing our omni, vision and potential.  Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we feel good about our ability to handle the increased volume of traffic based on the significant investments we've made over the last several years. In technology, IT infrastructure, our guest education center and DCs, all of which continue to produce results.  Regarding our international business, we continue to be excited by the level of performance across each region, which shows how well our brand translates across borders and beyond North America. It's clear that there is a vast opportunity for lululemon as we expand further into EMEA, in China and in the Asia Pacific region.  In Q3, we saw strength across every major region, with each generating strong double-digit sales growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. In China, our 2-year CAGR growth of more than 70% significantly outpaced the performance we saw overall in international as we continue to see compelling guest response to our merchandise assortment online and in our stores. Our team also continues to maintain a steady pace of new store openings in the market.  And in Europe, our 2-year CAGR revenue growth of over 20% was driven by broad-based strength across most of our key markets coupled with an improving brick-and-mortar business in the United Kingdom following very prolonged COVID-19-related closures. We are on track to open 40 to 45 stores in our international regions this year and are excited by the significant runway for growth across our key markets outside of North America.  Before handing it over to Meghan, who will provide additional details on our Q3 financials and our guidance outlook, I want to bring our inaugural Impact report to your attention. One year ago, we published our Impact Agenda, which details our vision and strategy to help transform our industry and create a healthier world. It is structured into 3 interconnected pillars, Be Human, Be Well and Be Planet, each with a set of specific goals and strategies.  We will report annually on our progress towards these goals and I hope you will take the time to visit the Sustainability section of our website to learn more. We recognize that it will take continuous learning and sustained dedication to achieve our goals. We are firmly committed to accountability, transparency and doing the necessary work to help build a safer and healthier world.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin.  Our business remained strong in Q3. The trend in stores continued to improve with productivity above 2019, while our e-commerce business continues to comp positively over the growth we experienced last year. I will share our guidance outlook with you in a few minutes, but I think it's important for our investors to know that we are raising our guidance for the year despite increasing airfreight costs and a more conservative view on revenue for MIRROR. This is a testament to the underlying strength of our core business and to our teams around the globe who enable this impressive performance.  Let me now share with you the details of our Q3 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our cash position, liquidity and inventories. Please note that the adjusted financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR, but exclude approximately $24 million of acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect in Q3 2021, and $8.5 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effect in Q3 2020. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.  For Q3, total net revenue increased 30% to $1.45 billion, above our expectations of $1.4 billion to $1.43 billion. This included a 28% increase in North America and a 40% increase in our international business. On a 2-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 26%. This was better than our expectation of a 24% to 25% 2-year CAGR growth and continues to outpace our 3-year CAGR of 19%, leading up to the pandemic.  Within North America, revenue increased 23% and within international, we saw a 42% increase, both on a 2-year CAGR basis. In our digital channel, revenues increased 54% on a 2-year CAGR basis and contributed $587 million of top line or 40% of total revenue. In our store channel, sales increased 10% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Productivity in stores exceeded 2019 levels and continues the trend of improving productivity we've seen throughout the year. On average, we had 96% of our stores opened throughout Q3 and 99% opened at the end of the quarter. Square footage increased 11% versus last year, driven by the addition of 37 net new stores since Q3 of 2020. During the quarter, we opened 18 net new stores.  Gross profit for the third quarter was $829 million or 57.2% of net revenue compared to 56.1% of net revenue in Q3 2020 and 55.1% of net revenue in Q3 2019. Our gross margin increase of 210 basis points relative to 2019 was driven by 230 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation and product team costs and 30 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point decrease in product margin. Excluding a 230 basis point increase in airfreight related to industry supply chain challenges, product margin would have increased versus 2019. I would also note that markdowns declined relative to 2019.  Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $545 million or 37.6% of net revenue compared to 36.8% of net revenue in Q3 2020 and 35.9% of net revenue in Q3 2019. The deleverage in the quarter versus Q3 2020 resulted from increased investments in people and brand building to support our growth initiatives, coupled with deleverage on foreign exchange. The deleverage relative to Q3 2019 is primarily the result of consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in 2019, and modest deleverage on depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange.  Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $282 million or 19.4% of net revenue compared to 19.1% of net revenue in Q3 2020 and 19.2% of net revenue in Q3 2019. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $71 million or 25.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.9% a year ago. The reduction relative to last year is due primarily to a reduction in nondeductible expenses in international jurisdictions, an increase in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and a reduction in adjustments upon the filing of certain tax returns. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $211 million or $1.62 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.16 in Q3 of 2020 and $0.96 in Q3 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $122 million for the quarter compared to $66 million in the third quarter last year. Q3 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, supply chain investment and technology spend to support our business growth.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of total liquidity. We had approximately $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 22% versus last year and was $944 million at the end of Q3. This is slightly higher than our expectations for a 15% to 20% increase, reflecting the efforts of our supply chain and product teams to mitigate industry-wide supply chain risk by prioritizing production to ensure key styles are produced first and strategically increasing our use of airfreight. At the end of Q4, we expect inventory levels to increase approximately 20% to 25% relative to Q4 of 2020.  In Q3, we repurchased approximately 582,000 shares at an average price of $406. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $509 million of availability remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the recent $500 million increase our Board of Directors approved in early October.  Let me shift now to our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2021. While we're pleased with our performance over Thanksgiving, it's important to acknowledge that the macro environment remains uncertain, and we have several large volume weeks ahead of us. I'd also note that as the industry-wide supply chain issues have been well publicized, consumers may have started their holiday shopping earlier this year.  To account for these variables, as we have done throughout the COVID period, we continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.165 billion, representing a 2-year CAGR of 23% to 24%. We expect gross margin in Q4 to be flat with Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 guidance reflects an impact of approximately 450 basis points of pressure from airfreight costs due to poor congestion and capacity constraints. This represents an increase in airfreight expense relative to our prior guidance.  In Q4, we expect SG&A deleverage of approximately 200 to 250 basis points relative to 2019. Drivers of the deleverage versus 2019 include consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in 2019 and higher depreciation due to accelerated investments to support our e-commerce business in 2020 and 2021.  Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.32 versus adjusted EPS of $2.58 a year ago. This includes operating results from MIRROR but excludes acquisition and integration-related costs. As a reminder, we reported EPS of $2.28 in Q4 of 2019. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.29 billion. This represents an increase from our prior guidance range of $6.19 billion to $6.26 billion and includes our more conservative view on MIRROR revenue for the year of approximately $125 million to $130 million. This range also assumes our e-commerce business grows in the mid-teens relative to the outsized strength we experienced in 2020. When looking at total revenue, our guidance range implies a 2-year CAGR of approximately 25% to 26%, which is higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and is well ahead of the low teens CAGR contemplated in our Power of Three growth plan. We now expect to open 50 to 55 net new company-operated stores in 2021. This includes approximately 40 to 45 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage percentage increase in the low teens.  For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to expand between 100 to 150 basis points compared to the modest increase we saw in 2020. The reduction relative to our prior guidance of an increase of 150 to 200 basis points is driven by an increase in airfreight expense to 200 to 250 basis points for the year. Despite the increase in airfreight expense year-over-year, we continue to anticipate gross margin expansion in excess of our Power of Three growth plan, which assumes modest gross margin expansion annually.  When looking at SG&A for the full year, we are forecasting leverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2020. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 27%. For the fiscal year 2021, our revised range for adjusted diluted earnings per share is $7.69 to $7.76 versus our prior range of $7.38 to $7.48. Our EPS guidance continues to assume modest dilution from MIRROR in the 3% to 5% range, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs.  Despite our more conservative view on MIRROR revenue, we are being prudent with our expenditures, particularly related to digital marketing and this is enabling us to maintain the dilution percentage in the range we've been guiding to all year. Our updated EPS range also excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $375 million to $385 million for 2021. The increase versus 2020 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations including MIRROR shop-in-shops as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects.  Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. I am very pleased with the high-level performance of lululemon across every major metric in category, which allows us to deliver such a strong quarter. We have begun the fourth quarter with the inventory, staffing and strategies in place to enable us to finish 2021 in a position of strength as we expect to pass the $6 billion annual revenue level for the first time.  The way we continue to grow and expand is a testament to the commitment and passion of the people of lululemon. I am particularly proud of our agility throughout this year and over the course of the pandemic and how the leadership team continues to build upon the momentum in the business.  And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And great job navigating what's a tremendously difficult environment. Calvin, I wanted to start by talking about average initial retails, what you think the pricing power there is? And most of retail didn't really touch their initial retails in 2021, but they are going to start touching the like-for-likes in 2022. So just wondering kind of how you're thinking about that and lululemon relative to that pricing? Meghan, given that 40% is core in the ongoing supply chain issues, is there an increase in weeks of supply scheduled for spring of 2022 as a safety stock? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. On pricing, we have no plans to change our pricing strategy at this time. As you know, we lead with technical innovation and price our garments accordingly. We're always studying the marketplace and make pricing adjustments as necessary based on the competitive dynamics and opportunities that exist, but we have no plans to make a change heading into 2022. Meghan Frank : Adrienne, in terms of inventory, we do have an advantage in the proportion of our inventory that sits in core product. And while we aren't sharing details on our 2022 plans today, the team is actively looking at opportunities to capitalize on that core assortment and pull that forward where that makes sense for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : And congrats on another nice quarter. So Calvin, revenues year-to-date up 60% versus 2019, and you've mentioned demand exceeding supply now for the second straight quarter. Could you speak to new customer acquisition and drivers of the balance that you're seeing between stores and digital, which point in your view to sustainable strength of the brand? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Thanks, Matthew. There are a number of the overall driving metrics that point to that. The obvious one is the challenge we've seen in inventory. And even though we've been able to achieve these results, product drops, some of the product innovation and the way in which the design team's intended our activities and our categories to be launched for the guest just haven't materialized pretty much the entire and we've been chasing into that. So we know there's an upside to being able to represent and present the product the way in which it was designed and intended to.  That said, when we look at our new guest acquisition, it remains very strong as before the pandemic during and post. We continue to see new guests come into the brand. We continue to have success migrating those new guests up through different categories and their spend journey and the retention of our high-spending loyal lululemon guest remain incredibly strong.  What we alluded to during the early pandemic when stores were closed was that we -- we're seeing more of our store only shift into omni. We are seeing our omni-guest spend more. And because we have such a strong position with digital, that enabled them to engage in the brand and do purchasing. And we know there were some store-only guests that could not have access or chose not to. Now that the stores are up and operating, we're very pleased with seeing them return back to the brand as we continue to grow.  We referenced stores being great acquirer of men's. Now that they're up and you've seen our men's business has come back incredibly strong, and we see new guests through that and having our stores perform above our 2019 numbers while maintaining our digital is really a factor of all those inputs, predominantly new guests, migration of guests and retention of gas, all very healthy. And we know our product positioning is only going to get stronger, and the team did a wonderful job chasing it, but it wasn't our best -- it was a good foot and it was -- we had a bigger intention even behind what we were able to get out. Matthew Boss : That's great color. It's perfect lead into my second question on the product positioning. Could you elaborate on trends that you've seen so far in the fourth quarter? And given your inventory position, but then the proactive steps that you took to airfreight in product, what is your ability to chase demand if momentum exceeds plan? And to your point on product positioning, what do you wish you had more of or maybe changes that in an ideal world to meet that outsized demand? Calvin McDonald : Yes. No, thank you. Overall, on product, there haven't been any dramatic shifts to the trends that we saw coming in. We've seen great growth across men's and women's, very balanced growth across categories, top, second layer, bottom, short skirts and into the men's sweat categories and across our activities. So again, and as I've mentioned before, our growth remains very balanced across men's, women's, across each category, across all the activities we've identified and are innovating into and across every region that we are doing business in and across our channels, be it stores and digital.  What would I have wanted more of, there are some products that we are light on. Outerwear is a category that has performed incredibly well for us this season. And we didn't have the depth there that we would have wanted. Some of our second layer categories, OTM leading into the holiday have been delayed, some of our early fall receipts. But overall, because of our balance in inventory core, we've been able to and we have learned in. We've made sure through airfreight to have those goods.  And they are our fuel and drivers, and they continue to be and we're in a good position, but there are definitely certain items in areas where we've seen the delay as a result of the shutdown, but we have more than enough balance and key growth across our entire portfolio that is able to keep fueling the results that we achieved. Meghan Frank : Matt, and I'd just add on there. We did with inventory up 22%, which was above our expectation of 15% to 20% growth and really reflective of the team's supply chain and product teams leveraging airfreight. We do make those decisions about 6 weeks out. Certainly don't have as much flexibility as a normal environment just with supply chain constraints, but it is something we're actively managing where we do have opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : I guess, Meghan, I just wanted to dig into the airfreight dynamic a bit more. Is there any way you could possibly share with us based on spring orders, what kind of pressure you guys should expect or we should expect you guys to see in the first half of next year? And then I guess if you don't want to get too specific, I guess for the full year, you're saying 200 to 250 basis points of pressure. How much of that based on what you know today is reasonable for us to expect for you guys to kind of recapture in 2022? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Ike. I think a little soon to put a fine point on 2022, but we do expect that the supply chain pressures will be with us as we move into the first half of the year. That said, we think there'll be some puts and takes in our gross margin, and we are right now maintaining our commitment to modest margin expansion next year. Certainly, airfreight presents an opportunity over the long term, but there will be some normalization of historically high full-price sell-throughs and low markdowns as well as other investments in our business to maintain that modest margin expansion goal, and we'll share more in spring '22 on our next 5-year outlook. Irwin Boruchow : Meghan, is it fair to say that this should be the peak of the airfreight pressure in Q4? Meghan Frank : I believe so. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Mark Altschwager : So to start out, I mean, you sound very pleased with the start to the holiday season. Were there any changes to your approach to the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period this year versus prior years, especially in light of the supply chain disruption? And then relatedly, you've talked about how you may have left some sales on the table in the quarter given the inventory constraints, but you're also mindful of some potential pull-forward in sales that might be happening. So maybe just talk about your level of confidence of potentially building on the Q3 growth rates. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Mark. In terms of our Thanksgiving shopping over Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there was really no change to our strategy and tactic. In that by, I mean, we didn't take further markdowns. We don't play promotionally, as you know. The teams definitely worked hard to get the stores and online in a good inventory position. To satisfy demand, we made sure that we were ready. We've been investing for months, quite frankly, going back to the beginning of the pandemic to get our digital channel ready to anticipate the sort of volume.  And as I alluded to in my opening remarks, we had the largest volume day in the history of lululemon on Thursday, and the site performed incredibly well, as has our DCs and the full support. So there wasn't anything unique, there wasn't anything artificial to drive demand. Just all good work and hard work to get ready for the demand and getting our core product out there with traditional markdown activity. And we saw that the volume and we are anticipating a pull-forward. So we are continuing to monitor the weeks ahead. As Meghan mentioned, there are some big weeks ahead. We're pleased with our position. We're pleased coming out of November. We knew that we needed to have a strong start to the quarter, and we achieved that. And we're continuing to monitor and get ready for the coming weeks. Meghan Frank : And Mark, I'd just add in terms of Q3 growth in next year, I think the guest metrics and growth that Calvin was pointing to in both new and existing engagement give us confidence in our ability to continue to grow on top of this baseline as well as our international and North America omni expansion strategies. And again, we'll share more in spring '22 on our next 5-year outlook. Mark Altschwager : And just a quick follow-up on MIRROR, if I could. Can you just give us some perspective on how you're thinking about balancing the growth and profitability for the platform for 2022? I guess, would you expect it to be net dilutive to EPS next year? Meghan Frank : Sure. So in terms of MIRROR in 2022, we're not going to share specifics today, but I would offer that we -- the path to profitability is very much within our control. We'll remain prudent in our investments as we have been this year. And we do expect dilution to begin to decrease next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the competitive landscape in China for the lulu brand. Just are you seeing any change in dynamic between global brands versus national brands there? And then relatedly, any early reads on 11/11 in that market? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Thanks, Erinn. We haven't seen any notable change from our brand perspective in the China market. As you heard in my opening remarks in terms of the performance, we continue to be very pleased with the results, 2-year CAGR of 70%. We continue to invest in China, opening stores, invest in our headquarters in Shanghai and creating in-country roles and jobs to really help support that business. Continue to connect with the community, which is our unique way of working with. And we see a real opportunity to continue and to push for the sweat life and the healthy initiatives that exist within that market and feel we play a very unique role in doing that. So from our perspective, we're pleased and pleased with the investments we're making in the connection with the community. Meghan Frank : Yes. And I'd say in terms of 11/11, Erinn, generally in line with our expectations. We're not going to share specifics, but as Calvin mentioned, strong performance in China with approximately 70% to your CAGR in Q3, so we've been pleased. Erinn Murphy : Great. And then if I could just follow up on your footwear initiative. Is that still planned for next year? And how material are you thinking about the investment behind building that platform out? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Erinn. Yes, we're still on track for a spring '22 launch. And just as a reminder, and consistent with how we've shared it, it's a test and learn for us. We're excited about it, excited about the opportunity and our unique position. But it's not required in the Power of Three growth commitments that we've shared and therefore, are taking a growth approach to this new initiative. Operator : Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : Just building on Erinn's question, can you give us an update on the margin performance of the international business? And how do you think about the path to parity with North America margins given the investments you're making there? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, thanks. We are profitable in our international business overall. We are still on the path to profitability in Europe. We had pushed out that date to '22 just given the impact of store closures that we experienced throughout 2020 and then continuing into the first half of '21. And sorry, can you remind me the second half of your question? Lorraine Maikis : Yes. Just looking at the path to parity overall, given all the investments you're planning to make in Asia. Meghan Frank : Yes. We certainly see opportunity in the international margin. That said, we also see opportunity for expansion in our North America margin. So expect it to sit below, and there are some structural rent items that are a little bit more pressure, I would say, in our international region relative to North America. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen. John Kernan : Nice job on the quarter. So what enabled you to outperform your expectations by this much given the reduction to MIRROR -- I guess in the core business, what outperformed your expectations from the last time you gave revenue guidance versus where we are now and what's a pretty difficult environment out there given the supply chain headwinds? Meghan Frank : Yes. I'd say, John, it's really been broad-based. So we've -- our performance has come both from channels and e-comm as well as across women's, men's and accessories. And I think we've been particularly pleased, I'd say, with our store performance, so exceeding 2019 productivity in Q3 which was up from flat in Q2 and then 88% of 2019 in Q1. So we've seen some nice acceleration there. At the same time, e-commerce business has continued to be very strong. So we were up 22% year-over-year in Q3 and then 54% on a 2-year CAGR basis, so really pleased, I'd say, across the board. John Kernan : Excellent. Quick follow-up, just on SG&A dollars. It looks like the expectations implied for SG&A expense are a little bit lower versus where they were last quarter. Can you talk to the drivers of that? Are you dialing back some of the investments in MIRROR and some of the acquisition costs there? Any comments on SG&A as obviously, the gross margin headwinds picked up a bit on airfreight. Meghan Frank : Yes. So we did experience CAC for MIRROR in excess of our LTV to CAC ratio parameters in Q3 that continued into Q4. So we have made a strategic pullback there. And then there has been also some efficiencies identified on the lululemon side that are contributing to that SG&A line as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : Curious, can you just give us an update on the number of MIRROR shop-in-shops you have currently? Anything you could share in terms of what that does to the stores that they're in, connectivity to the customer and maybe just what your future plans are for shop-in-shops as you look out to next year? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Paul. We did achieve our goal of 200 stores, that's both across the U.S. and in Canada. I think the Canadian number is around 48 is the final number. So call it 152 and 48. We have been and we're almost at the full MIRROR leads in each of those stores, which is a critical component to really activating the MIRROR and driving guest engagement and demonstrations. We saw -- we're very pleased with the results in Canada when we launched, which has only been the last few weeks. And we really wanted to test and learn and launch just through the lululemon channels and synergies, leveraging both online already guest relationships that we had in the store channel and very pleased with the start of the results of that initiative. And then I'd say across all very encouraging, and it's early in this, but we know it is one of our huge advantages of how we unlock synergies and tackle what remains the #1 opportunity, which is just general awareness behind this product in this category and the uniqueness of our proposition. One example is in-store demonstrations have a 6% conversion to sale, which is very encouraging.  When you think of traditional retail conversion numbers of foot traffic in, our ability to convert 6% of those engaging in demonstrations with the MIRROR, it's a very encouraging number, which is why that MIRROR key lead is critical. In higher volume doors, having 2 key MIRROR leads to support the store in 7 days a week operation. And again, we're early. We see our unique point of view and the impact it's having on performances, and we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense and play our unique role and keep building this business forward. Paul Lejuez : And how has your thinking evolved just in terms of maybe using the existing customer base of the MIRROR to actually sell lulu product, if that's something on the horizon that you're going to be doing a little bit more on? Calvin McDonald : I think there's definitely the aspirational, which is we want everybody sweating on a MIRROR to be in lululemon, and we want everybody sweating with lululemon to be engaging and using a MIRROR. And that's an aspirational vision, but it's to say there's opportunity on both sides. As we continue to move forward, more and more of these guests are already or have shopped with lululemon, which is good because a big part of the role MIRROR plays with us is as a membership community that drives loyalty, retention and spend with our lululemon guests.  We know the more they sweat with us, the more they spend with us. And our core business is our priority and will always remain our priority, and MIRROR is a way in which we drive that business forward. So we are seeing those dynamics play out. There is an opportunity. There are new guests we acquire and see come in to the family through MIRROR and we'll be able to convert them over. But the collective play is about retention, loyalty and increased spend, and we're pleased with those dynamics so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Meghan, would you -- could you guys give us some thoughts on what you think are some of the realistic scenarios for that store productivity number you referenced a few times as you look into 4Q? I know they get quite crowded as you get very close to the holiday. But maybe if there's a pull-forward, maybe that actually would have helped if there was any capacity issues in a normal season. But how should we think about what -- some of the scenarios you thought about as far as what the stores can do on a productivity basis fourth quarter? And then I guess, Calvin, if you can help us just back up if we think to the 2023 plan with the SG&A, I think if we look at the financial model from the Analyst Day, the thought was 13%, 14% type revenue growth and some SG&A leverage every year, maybe 10 basis points about. And I think you've delivered obviously, revenue growth has been much different than that because they're much higher than that because of the pandemic. But I know a lot of moving parts in there, but you mentioned a lot of times you pulled forward a lot of spend, particularly to fulfill on e-commerce.  As we look out, excluding the MIRROR business, just at the core, is it -- or is the back end of that Analyst Day period a bigger SG&A leverage period because you got to those investments earlier and they generated bigger revenue returns than you thought? Or do you start looking at '24 and '25 investments and pulling those in as you look at '22 and '23? Meghan Frank : Michael, thanks it's Meghan. So in terms of store productivity for Q4, we are managing our business from an omni perspective and really looking at multiple scenarios. I would say store productivity, I would say, flat to 2019 to up slightly. It's probably a good baseline scenario, though, again, we are planning for multiple scenarios to flex where the demand comes to us. And I'll also take the long-term question in terms of SG&A. Michael Binetti : Sure. Meghan Frank : So we did have modest SG&A expansion in our long-term plan. At this point, we remain on that commitment. And what we're really focused on is our operating income and growing our operating income in excess of sales growth. We have had some shift in dynamic of our business with more investment in e-comm to support the accelerated growth there, of which depreciation sits in SG&A and we've also had some lower occupancy and expenses, and so some more gross margin leverage come through. We'll continue to balance our investments to grow our operating income, and we'll share more on our next 5-year outlook again in spring of '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : You spoke in your prepared remarks earlier to strong new guest acquisition and retention. As you think about the profile of the guests that you're acquiring today, can you talk to how that incremental new guest might differ in terms of demographics or preferred activities versus the customer that you acquired in prior years? What is your outlook for new guest acquisition going forward? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. From a general demographic perspective, we remain healthy across all the different demographic profiles from age, gender, and I will touch on the activity lens. But a lot of the initiatives we continue to deploy are resonating with younger consumers, very pleased with the health of new younger guest acquisition into the brand. And then as I mentioned, the migration and retention of the guests are very, very strong here at lululemon.  So when we look at activity, 2 points : one, the versatility of our product is our -- one of our greatest strengths, and it allows for guests to find what they need for their sweat life across multiple categories, be it bottoms, tops, second layer, shorts. And as you know, we've defined a very clear activities that we want to own and have significant share of mind, share of wallet position in and that is Run, Train and Yoga. And then we've identified what we call play categories, be it golf, tennis, and hike.  And these are businesses that equally, we're seeing our guests spend into and are helping to drive. But it's the versatility of the product and a very defined activity strategy linked to our product innovation that's helping to drive not just new guests, but spend with existing guests. And we are very early in those strategies.  As you know, we just launched a brand-new yoga franchise for our female guest at the beginning of this quarter, the InStill Tight, which delivers a completely different feel sensation through our smooth cover material. And it's just one example of our approach of building franchises that deliver on feel states through these key core activities that are driving both new guest acquisition and spend with our existing guests. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Thanks. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Okay. Great. Meghan, can I just start on a follow-up on gross margin. I think you indicated that you had 230 basis points of airfreight here in the third quarter and that really accounted for more than the 50 basis point decline in your product margin. If I back that inbound airfreight charge or cost out, am I right in doing so to get to, let's say, a gross merchandise margin increase in the quarter of 180 basis points? Is that an okay way for me to think about it? Meghan Frank : Kimberly, I would think about also if you're looking for a baseline for future planning, just that we had historically high full-price sell-throughs and lower markdown rates. So when we look into the future, we will have some puts and takes within our gross margin rates. And right now, we're committed to that modest margin expansion as we outlined in our Power of Three growth plan. Kimberly Greenberger : Okay. Got it. So you'll hopefully get back a good chunk of that airfreight next year in the third quarter, but perhaps the 180 -- they'll be as well, maybe a small bit of get back on markdowns or the pure merchandise margin, okay. Understood. Did you quantify the potential airfreight costs for Q4 in basis points, Meghan, I'm not sure if I heard that. Meghan Frank : Yes, we did. So 450 basis points of pressure in Q4 relative to 2019. And then also for the full year, 200 to 250 basis points relative to 2020. Kimberly Greenberger : Okay. Thanks so much. And my last question for Calvin. I heard you on the pricing philosophy, and that makes a ton of sense, Calvin, I think, to price for the performance that you're putting into the product year after year. We're starting to hear from some of our colleagues in supply chain that some of the OEMs in Asia are experiencing higher cost for either labor, utilities, raw materials. Would lululemon philosophically try to price for any actual increase in the cost of goods that your suppliers might be feeling? Would you think that, that would be an appropriate way to also raise price to the end consumer? Calvin McDonald : I mean, I think -- we really do price to market, and there are obviously a variety of inputs and considerations, and you've alluded to some. But as a business that is positioned as a premium brand that has much innovation built into the product. We look at a variety of factors to make our pricing decisions and it's just not -- we won't just do it unilaterally because of those pressures, we'll look at other ways to manage the overall mix and maintain our committed margins. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and in today's earnings press release. In addition, comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K are available under our Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the fourth quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. It's my pleasure to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a strong year. Once again, we delivered revenue growth in excess of our Power of Three targets, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 31% compared to last year and 22% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Looking at our full year results, I'm particularly proud that we crossed the $6 billion in annual revenue milestone, and we accomplished this despite the ongoing challenges in the macro environment. And we have seen our momentum continue and accelerate as we enter the first quarter.  Our guidance calls for 24% to 26% top line growth and 19% to 23% adjusted EPS growth in quarter 1. For 2022 overall, we are also guiding to another strong year for the company, and I'm optimistic about our performance and opportunities going forward as we continue to build upon our unique strengths and bring technical innovation to our guests. I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and annual performance on today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again in a few weeks when we host our Analyst Day, where we will share our vision and outlook for the next 5 years.  But before I begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the horrific situation in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding. While we do not operate in Ukraine, we have made a donation to the relief efforts and are also supporting our employees who have family and friends in the region. In addition, as we look around the world, we continue to closely monitor our markets that are experiencing the surging impacts of COVID-19. As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will prioritize the health and safety of our people and the communities we serve and the decisions that we make. Now turning to our results. The fourth quarter capped off another impressive year of growth for us, demonstrating the sustained momentum in the business. I want to thank our teams across the entire organization who navigated the Omicron variant, successfully executed against our Power of Three growth plan and continue to deliver for our guests and all of our stakeholders. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 23% versus last year and 23% on a 2-year CAGR basis. And for the full year, revenue grew 42% versus 2020 and 25% on a 2-year CAGR basis, an impressive performance by any benchmark with strength across our products, channels and geographies. Before discussing our results in more detail, I will touch on several topics, including the macro trends that continue to provide a tailwind for our business, the ongoing issues within the global supply chain and their impact on our inventory levels and pricing. lululemon continues to benefit from several consumer trends that uniquely position us in the marketplace. First, category strength as athletic apparel continues to outpace growth in overall apparel. Second, the growing significance of versatility, both while guests are engaging in their fitness routines and in their everyday lives. Third, the importance of both physical retail and the convenience of digital engagement, these speak particularly well to our operating model. And finally, the increasing focus on physical, mental and social well-being given everything that people are navigating across the globe. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 period, and we are well positioned to continue to grow our business in 2022 and beyond.  Shifting to the supply chain. We continue to experience delays across our global network, particularly related to transporting our products via ocean freight. As a result, we continue to lean more heavily into air freight. However, I am pleased with how our teams have become increasingly adept at navigating these challenges. We have implemented several strategies to ensure we have the proper levels of inventory to fuel our top line growth. And as I've stated on prior calls, our core seasonless product makes up a meaningful percentage of our inventory, approximately 45%, which carries minimal markdown risk and positions us well to fulfill ongoing and future guest demand. Meghan will discuss our inventory levels in more detail shortly.  When looking at pricing, we continue to be strategic. We plan to take some selective price increases over the course of the year on a small portion of our styles. Our pricing also factors in the value of our innovation, and we will continue to monitor the competitive environment to ensure we maintain our price position relative to our key peers.  Let me share further highlights from quarter 4 and our overall results for 2021, starting with the fourth quarter. First, we generated total revenue of $2.1 billion. Despite the onset of the Omicron variant during the peak weeks of the holiday season, we delivered growth in excess of our Power of Three plan. Second, our e-commerce business remained strong, with comps up 16% on top of a strong 92% last year. This translates on a 2-year CAGR basis to an increase in e-commerce of 50%. Third, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.37, which is better than the guidance we provided in January. And as I mentioned, we are pleased with how our momentum accelerated into the first quarter, as indicated by our strong guidance range.  For the full year 2021, we delivered on our financial commitments and also made notable headway on our impact agenda goals. Some key milestones include generating total revenue of $6.26 billion, delivering adjusted earnings per share of $7.79 and achieving our Power of Three targets early including exceeding our total revenue target, doubling our e-commerce business, doubling our men's business, and we are on track to quadruple our international business by the end of 2022.  I'm pleased in our ability to deliver every 2023 goal ahead of schedule, which is particularly noteworthy given the effects of the global pandemic. This level of performance is only possible because of the agility and nimbleness of our teams who successfully navigated the macro environment, supported each other and found new ways to engage with our guests. I'm also proud of how we advanced our impact agenda in 2021 to drive meaningful positive change in the world.  A few examples include launching our first reCommerce program, lululemon Like New and 2 test markets and introducing our limited edition Earth Dye Collection; partnering with and investing in Genomatica to create the first ever plant-based alternative to nylon, which will help us achieve our goals to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials and have end-of-life solutions by 2030; and establishing our lululemon Center for Social Impact to help break the barriers to well-being in local and global communities with a commitment to contribute $75 million by 2025. These are important milestones and represent only the beginning of what we will accomplish related to sustainability and well-being.  Next, I will provide some additional details on our quarter 4 results and the foundational strengths that drive our business, fuel our success and give us a distinct competitive advantage. I will begin with product innovation. Our momentum remains on the upswing across all major categories, with women's revenue increasing 20%, men's growing 28% and accessories up 33%, all on a 2-year CAGR basis. In quarter 4, we continued to leverage the Science of Feel to fuel product newness and innovation, our guests responded well to our holiday merchandise assortment, and we saw a positive response to outerwear, second layers and technical shorts for both women and men. Looking forward, our product pipeline remains robust, and I'm excited for the innovations we are bringing to market in 2022. Some highlights include our multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee. I'm excited by the reaction to our product in the buzz this partnership created for our brand, notably both inside and outside of Canada.  Partnering with Team Canada is a unique opportunity for us to build awareness for lululemon on the global stage and to support some of the world's most elite athletes. We are off to a great start. And I'm thrilled that this month, we launched our footwear collection, and we have received a very broad-based positive reaction to our unique women's first positioning. In development for more than 4 years and leveraging our 20-plus years of designing and creating performance gear for women, we revealed our first 3 styles of technical athletic shoes and 1 performance slide to the market.  The first of our 4 styles, Blissfeel, began selling on March 22 in North America and Mainland China and the U.K. will launch shortly. The initial guest response to Blissfeel has dramatically exceeded our expectations, not to mention incredible reviews from a number of publications and guests, and we'll have more to share about our footwear at Analyst Day. Before moving on to our omni guest experience pillar, I want to highlight several additional innovations we have teed up in 2022. First, we will continue to lean into our franchise strategy, and you'll see us introduce new silhouettes into our popular Scuba and Define collections. Next, as guests begin to return to the office into more normalcy in their lives, we will continue to expand our on-the-move collection with new styles of tops and bottoms for men and women planned throughout the year.  And finally, I'm very excited that we are advancing our play strategy as well with the launch of our first-ever design for tennis collection available in stores and online beginning this week and our first-ever design for golf collection, which will roll out next week. As you can see, we have ample opportunity to bring new technical solutions to our guests and I'm pleased with how our product pipeline looks going forward. Switching now to our store channel. Total revenue in quarter 4 increased 47% versus last year and 3% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Traffic increased 50% and operating profit expanded significantly versus last year. We were pleased to get off to a promising start during the recent holiday season and then like others, we experienced several consequences of the Omicron variants such as capacity constraints, limits on staff availability and reduced operating hours in some locations. Towards the middle of January, we began to see store traffic improve, and this trend has continued into the first quarter. This acceleration underpins our guidance, which is detailed in our press release, and Meghan will discuss shortly. I'm excited by the energy I'm seeing in our stores. In fact, I was able to spend some time with our teams in New York earlier this month, and it was incredible to see our guests once again looking to connect with lululemon in real life and the excitement among our educators to welcome them back into our stores.  Turning to our e-commerce business. We continue to successfully leverage our investments in our sites and apps over the last 2 years which enhanced the user experience and allowed us to serve even more guests where, when and how they want to shop. Looking forward, we will fuel ongoing growth in both traffic and conversion by continuing to make foundational investments across our digital platform. These will include enhancing our storytelling by adding more content and product comparison, improving inventory accuracy and continuing to make the guest checkout experience more seamless.  Our omni operating model has served us well through the COVID-19 environment. We were an omni business long before the pandemic hit, and this enables us to continue raising our capabilities across channels to engage with our guests on their terms in new and compelling ways.  Turning now to MIRROR. In quarter 4, MIRROR performed in line with our revised expectations and for the year, both revenue and dilution were consistent with the guidance we provided. We remain enthusiastic about MIRROR, the opportunities within hybrid fitness and our plans for the platform in 2022 and beyond. We will hold further discussion about MIRROR for our Analyst Day in a few weeks, and I'm excited to share more with you about the evolution of our business and how it will further help build loyalty and community at lululemon. Before handing it over to Meghan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our international business. While we saw similar impacts from COVID-19 across many of our international markets, our performance remained strong in quarter 4. It's also important to note that we remain in early days of our growth trajectory outside of North America. For the full year 2021, international revenue grew by more than 50% and still represents just 15% of the business, and our EMEA business turned profitable for the first time. We continue to see how well the lululemon brand translates across borders and our plans in the coming year call for approximately 40 new stores opening across our international markets. In quarter 4, we saw a strong performance from every major region with each generating robust double-digit sales growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. In Mainland China, revenue increased more than 60% on a 2-year CAGR basis. After experiencing a slowdown in stores in December related to the COVID-19 variant, we saw an acceleration in January, fueled by our Lunar New Year activation. The Olympics also generated considerable excitement in the region, and we saw a significant lift in traffic that coincided with the games.  And one other data point among many, in Australia, we have begun a store optimization program modeled after our successful approach in North America. Initial guest response to our remodeled stores has been strong, and the program is also helping drive new guest acquisition to our most mature international market. This shows the growth potential for lululemon in both our more mature and relatively new international markets. And with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. We delivered solid performance in Q4 while navigating supply chain challenges and the impacts of COVID-19. And I'm encouraged that we've seen trends accelerate in Q1. We are positioned well for spring despite the challenges that continue to exist in the macro environment, and I'm excited about what's in store for lululemon in 2022. I'm also thrilled that I'll get the chance to see many of you in person at our Analyst Day next month. We have a new 5-year plan, and I'm looking forward to sharing our updated long-term financial targets with you at that time. Let me now share with you the details of our Q4 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that the adjusted financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR that exclude approximately $1.5 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effect in Q4 2021 and $7.8 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effect in Q4 2020. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q4, total net revenue increased 23% to $2.1 billion, in line with our guidance. Comparable sales increased 22% with a 32% increase in stores and a 16% increase in digital. On a 2-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 23%. In our store channel, sales increased 47% on a 1-year basis and 3% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Productivity was slightly below 2019 levels due to impacts from the Omicron variant, including increased capacity constraints, more -- limited staff availability and reduced operating hours in certain locations. On average, we had 99% of our stores opened throughout Q4. We currently have 97% open with current closures related to the impact of COVID-19 in China.  Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 53 net new stores since Q4 of 2020. During the quarter, we opened 22 net new stores. In our digital channel, revenues increased 50% on a 2-year CAGR basis and contributed $1 billion of top line or 49% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 21% and within international, we saw a 41% increase, both on a 2-year CAGR basis.  Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion or 58.1% of net revenue compared to 58.6% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 58% of net revenue in Q4 2019. The deleverage relative to 2020 was driven by increased air freight expense. Our gross margin increase of 10 basis points relative to 2019 was driven by 120 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation, product team and DC costs and 20 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange, which was partially offset by a 130 basis point decrease in product margin. Q4 product margin included an increase of approximately 530 basis points in air freight related to macro supply chain challenges, without which product margin would have increased versus 2019. I would also note that markdowns declined 110 basis points relative to 2019. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $642 million or 30.2% of net revenue compared to 31.5% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 28.2% of net revenue in Q4 2019. The leverage in the quarter versus Q4 2020 resulted from leverage in our store channel, somewhat offset by increased investments in corporate SG&A. The deleverage relative to Q4 2019 is primarily related to the consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in 2019. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $592 million or 27.8% of net revenue compared to 26.9% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 29.8% of net revenue in Q4 2019. Excluding MIRROR, lululemon-only operating margin increased modestly versus 2019, inclusive of the 530 basis point increase in air freight. Tax expense for the quarter was $156 million or 26.4% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.4% a year ago. The reduction relative to last year is primarily due to increased deductions for stock-based compensation and a reduction in adjustments upon the filing of certain tax returns. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $436 million or $3.37 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.58 in Q4 of 2020 and $2.28 in Q4 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $128 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the fourth quarter last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, supply chain investment and technology spend to support our business growth.  Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 49% versus last year and was $966 million at the end of Q4. Our product teams continue to strategically use air freight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic.  On a 2-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 29% relative to 2019 at the end of Q4 and is well positioned relative to our Q1 2022 top line guidance of a 25% to 26% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis. Again, comparing to 2019. Due to the supply chain issues that existed throughout 2021, we were in an under-inventory position for most of the year and likely could not fulfill all guest demand, which our product teams have taken into account as they have planned merchandise receipts for 2022. In addition, we continue to leverage our core assortment, which makes up approximately 45% of our total inventory.  Looking forward and grounded in my prior comments, we expect inventory dollars to grow in excess of the 49% 1-year growth rate we experienced at the end of Q4 2021 until the end of the year when the growth rate will begin to moderate. However, when looking at units, we'd expect growth in line with the 29% CAGR at the end of Q4 versus our 3-year CAGR revenue guidance of 23% to 24%. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 844,000 shares at an average price of approximately $381. For the full year, we repurchased 2.2 million shares, returning $813 million to shareholders. By mid-March, we have completed our current authorization, and I'm pleased that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion program. This program is our largest individual authorization ever and speaks to the optimistic view of our future shared by our management team and our Board of Directors.  Before discussing our guidance, I'd like to provide an update on MIRROR. As Calvin said, MIRROR performed in line with our expectations in Q4. For the year, revenue and dilution were also in line with our expectations. Looking at 2022, we expect MIRROR will generate revenue in excess of 2021 and dilution will improve. Beyond that, we'll have more to say regarding MIRROR at our Analyst Day, when we're excited to share with you our updated vision for the business.  Let me shift now to our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2022. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.55 billion, representing a 1-year growth rate of 24% to 26% and a 3-year CAGR of 25% to 26%. We expect to open 5 to 10 net new company-operated stores in Q1. I'd also note that store productivity has trended modestly above 2019 levels to date in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to be down 200 to 250 basis points relative to Q1 of 2021. Our Q1 guidance includes an impact of approximately 300 basis points of pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. In Q1, we expect SG&A leverage of approximately 200 to 250 basis points relative to 2021. Drivers of the leverage include reduced digital marketing costs at MIRROR and cost efficiencies in both our store and e-commerce channels. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.43 versus adjusted EPS of $1.16 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.49 billion to $7.615 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the mid-teens relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 23% to 24%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020.  We expect to open approximately 70 net new company-operated stores in 2022. This is an increase relative to our recent annual opening cadence and reflects both the benefits and learnings from our pop-up strategy, which enables us to test and identify new markets where strong demand exists for our brand and informs our permanent store opening strategy and guests and insights derived from our digital business. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 40 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven by increased investment in our DC network and a strategic increase in product development cost for MIRROR. The increased MIRROR cost and gross margin will be offset by a reduction in digital marketing, which flows through SG&A.  Turning to SG&A for the full year. We are forecasting leverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021 driven by the increased sales and the shift in MIRROR investments I just mentioned. And when looking at operating margin for the full year 2022, we continue to expect modest expansion.  I also wanted to provide some additional color for the quarters beyond Q1. When looking at revenue, we expect growth in the low 20s on a 3-year CAGR basis in quarters 2 through 4. In terms of gross margin, we are taking into account the dynamic nature of the global supply chain environment, our current thinking regarding air freight usage and the ramp in air freight usage we experienced last year. We currently expect gross margin to decline approximately 200 to 250 basis points versus last year in Q2, declined approximately 100 to 150 basis points versus last year in Q3 and then expand versus last year in Q4. In terms of SG&A, we'd expect it to be relatively flat with 2021 in quarters 2 and 3 and then leverage in Q4. For the full year 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29%. We expect our tax rate for 2022 to be higher than 2021 as we benefited from some higher tax deductions related to stock-based compensation in 2021. And in 2022, we are expecting to begin accruing for Canadian withholding taxes on earnings, which we aren't able to repatriate on a tax-free basis. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.15 to $9.35 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovation as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Notably, we are beginning a new multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth. And we are also ramping up our square footage growth relative to last year. A range of $600 million to $625 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three target of 68%.  Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. As you can see from these results in the early start to 2022, this is an exciting time for lululemon as we build upon the momentum in the business and the across-the-board performance of our products, channels and markets. We look forward to sharing more with you during our Analyst Day, which will be held in person in New York and available through a live stream. We will go into more details on the strength of the brand and speak to our next 5-year growth plan. And the fact that we have achieved our current growth targets ahead of schedule bodes well for the opportunities ahead.  In closing, I want to thank everyone across lululemon for continuing to consistently deliver at such a high level. I'm honored to work alongside each of you as we continue to deliver for our guests, shareholders and one another. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Congrats on the performance. I guess, Calvin, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the pricing initiatives that you mentioned. Could you just kind of talk us through timing, how you're kind of surgically looking there? And then how do you think about pricing into the footwear collection as well, that would be great. Calvin McDonald : Right. Thanks, Ike. I mean we continue to be strategic with our pricing strategy as we have been in the past. We are taking modest selective price increases over the course of the year. Some will go in place in Q2. And as we look forward, into additional quarters. As I mentioned, it's a very small portion of our styles that are impacted, about 10%. And this will help offset some of the pressure we're seeing on AUC. But we are constantly looking at multiple factors, such as the value of innovation, our range within our own product categories as well as in the marketplace and making sure that the performance of our apparel is always at a higher index than our pricing is relative to competitive options in the marketplace. So we are taking selective, but it's not a drastic move.  And then from a pricing on footwear, we definitely as you saw with the introduction of Blissfeel opened in a competitive position. We will apply the same approach to our footwear as we have our entire lineup, meaning very little discounting. We priced it effectively based on the innovation. Immediate response has been incredible. So we feel well priced. I don't plan to take any additional actions on footwear this year, and we'll manage the category as we look forward with additional innovation as well as evolution of the category over the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I'd love to hear a little bit more about how you're contemplating the different levers of growth throughout the brand this year. How are you thinking about the contribution from the core product line relative to growth in new products, such as footwear, tennis, golf and OTM? Calvin McDonald : Sure. Thanks, Brooke. Majority of our growth will continue to come from core. As you've heard me say before, we're early innings of growth across all of our growth levers. That starts with product and that's core within men's. That's core within women's that includes, obviously, the strength in our bottoms business and our core activities that we've identified, Run, Yoga, Train and OTM, where we still have opportunity to keep innovating and developing and bringing new innovation to the guests. Then you factor in the growth potential across our channels, be it digital stores and then our regions. These are the drivers of the business, and it is rooted in core in the key categories and activities that we're known for. We're excited about not just the pipeline behind those and how we'll continue to expand, but our ability to reach and extend into new categories as we're pulled into them with our guests and what their sweat needs are. Very excited with the introduction of footwear, and we're taking a very disciplined long-term approach to building that category.  And as you've heard me reference before, we have a number of play activities, which we know are the secondary sweat activities of our core loyal guests. Tennis, golf, hike are some of those. And we're excited to be able to bring, again, some innovation that delivers on unmet needs. Now in these activities, the versatility of our product is where we really play to our strength. There are a lot of golfers out there in ABC pants and ABC shorts, metal event shirts. And we see a select opportunity to bring some very distinct innovation to that activity, in particular, builds credibility and it will lift both the activity, our credibility in the activity as well as the core versatile product that we have. So that's been the strategy, and we're just further down the development of it in this year and excited about the newness that we're going. But the majority of the growth is still coming from core where we have a significant opportunity to continue to bring innovation behind those key activities. Operator : Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: It's great to hear the momentum accelerating into the first quarter. So congrats. Calvin, I believe this is probably for you. Just wanted to get some more color on kind of the potential in the North American market. This is the most stores that you've opened in quite some years, 70, with 40 internationally. Just wondering, is there a new target for North America or maybe you'll give that to us in April? And should we expect this to be sort of the new steady state? And then Meghan, any metrics around those four-wall margins or in the size, I'm assuming is considerably larger than the average that you have in the opening. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Adrienne. There's no change in our store expansion strategy, and that includes both the addition of new stores, testing new markets and new opportunities through our seasonal store initiative as well as expanding existing stores where we go in. We validate the market through seasonal. We move to a permanent location. And as we grow the business, we look to expand it, all within a moderate range relative to others, but very much within the square footage that we know can continue to prove, deliver on the productivity numbers, the economics that we're looking for as well as show up and represent the brand in the way we want between men's, women's, in particular, and we're seeing great success in doing that. So we still see for that strategy, significant opportunity in North America. Predominantly driven by the U.S. with some select opportunity in Canada, but reinvesting in our fleet for the expansion, as I mentioned as well, is very much the balanced approach. And then on Analyst Day, we'll be able to share more over the next 5 years how we see. But we still have a lot of opportunity for growth in all markets, including North America, across stores as well as digital. Meghan Frank : And Adrienne, I'd add, we have very healthy four-wall margins north of 20% for our store fleet and feel really confident in these openings as well as strong productivity. And we're healthy levels with the store productivity reaching back to 2019 levels quarter-to-date. So feel optimistic about store performance as we move forward, an important part of our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I was just hoping for an update on the international business, both Europe and Asia, where you stand profitability-wise and how you expect that to unfold in the coming years? Meghan Frank : Yes. Lorraine, it's Meghan. We reached, as Calvin mentioned, profitability in Europe, which would put us profitable overall for international region. Still see opportunity with scale as we expand that business, and we'll share more on our international strategy in a few weeks on Analyst Day. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen. John Kernan : Congrats on a phenomenal year and a great start to 2022. Looking forward to the Analyst Day. Meghan, did you give guidance for DTC in terms of the full year revenue guidance? I think I heard mid-teens? And if that's the case -- that does seem to imply that store productivity is now ramping above 2019 levels even as you open a lot of new stores internationally, and we're still not even fully out of a pandemic. So maybe if you could talk to DTC growth within guidance and store productivity within full year guidance and then what you're seeing from some of the newer stores that are coming online in terms of productivity? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, John. So we did share overall revenue growth of 20% to 22% on a 1-year basis. And within that, e-commerce growing in the mid-teens on an annual basis. And that would contemplate store productivity above 2019 levels, which we are seeing currently in Q1. I would say we continue to plan our business from an omni perspective and multiple channel scenarios to be able to meet the demand and where it comes to us and also navigating COVID-19 impacts were relevant. But that's our current outlook in terms of mid-teens growth for e-com and then stores above 2019 productivity. John Kernan : Got it. And then maybe one quick follow-up. The CapEx is stepping up a bit this year and obviously, stores growth is accelerating. But can you talk to other investments that might be going in the CapEx? Meghan Frank : Yes. It's really 2 key pieces. So the step-up in stores is one of them. And then we're also beginning a multiyear DC expansion strategy to support the long-term growth of our business. That capital range that we provided is 8% of sales, so in line with the 6% to 8% target that we provided on our last Analyst Day. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on the continued momentum. So Calvin, maybe could you just speak to drivers of the recent top line acceleration that you cited in the business? Maybe touch on categories. What are you most excited about as we think about the core innovation pipeline and how that potentially sets up for the potential halo as room to these additional categories across the store? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matthew, and that's -- I'll try to share some of my excitement and make sure that I hold enough for us celebrating in a few weeks when we come together on Analyst Day. But clearly, we know that product fuels our business and our momentum, and it has and it will continue to. And we are early innings on that product development opportunity. And there has been no fundamental change in the strategy of the key categories of Run, Train, Yoga and OTM and some of the key play activities, as I mentioned. What has driven our momentum in the business is really the continual introduction of those activities, gaining credibility behind those activities as well as color and flow. We have continued to work through the logistical challenges, saw a greater disruption in the fourth quarter, although still very pleased with our results. And the team continues to get better. So flow is better, core solid and the new innovation in either franchise supporting activities or in the new innovation that I alluded to.  Both men's and women's saw very strong double-digit growth. Every category within men's and women's, very strong outerwear second layer and technical shorts were some of the standout in fourth quarter. Obviously, COC, the Canadian Olympic Committee gear performed very well, introduction of footwear is off to a great start. These are small in relative terms, but we know our position to create brand awareness, consideration, drive loyalty with our existing guests and attract new guests and very encouraged with how well they're performing in those metrics as well.  And then as I look forward into '22, we have some exciting additions to existing powerful franchises, scuba, our Define, OTM, as our guests go back to work. The team has been working and building that out. We see men's is -- we're more developed than OTM for him and the team has been working on building out the assortment for her in terms of the versatility functionality of our gear. It really is a completely open space and opportunity for us. And then some of the play categories that are fun.  But more importantly, and I alluded to them before, is they build credibility in these activities and 80% of the assortment of these activities is our core product. So this is all geared and designed around remaining narrow and focused on assortment, driving consideration awareness and the key activities that we focused on and using both core and newness to drive that credibility and ultimately, the sales back to core. The formula is working and continues to build momentum, and we're excited, and we'll share a lot more on Analyst Day, but that gives you a little bit of flavor for the start of this year, at least until we get into the longer play. Matthew Boss : Great. Looking forward to the celebration in a few weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the nice results. As you think about new customer acquisition and new customer expansion. What are you seeing there? What do you see in digital versus stores? And any updates to your enhancements of how you're thinking to reintroduce the loyalty program and progress on re-commerce and what that can do to sales and margins? Meghan Frank : Dana, we saw growth across both new and existing guests in Q4. We've also experienced, as we've mentioned previously, more cross-shopping throughout the pandemic period, and we see higher value from our guests who come to us both on e-commerce and stores. So we continue to see that as an opportunity long term, and then I'll let Calvin take the loyalty question. Calvin McDonald : Yes. I'll quickly touch on both loyalty and reCommerce. Again, we'll probably sound, I apologize to the group, a bit of a broken record, but there are a lot of exciting initiatives that we've been testing and piloting and learning from and they play into our 5-year vision. And I do want to save for our time together in New York. But on loyalty, clearly, this brand has very strong loyalty with our guests. And uniquely and interestingly, it's been built the way we'd want it to through relationships, incredible product. We tested a loyalty program that extended that relationship into sweat and strengthened our position of community in our stores. And that led to our confidence around the MIRROR acquisition, which is really an opportunity for us to position it in that membership base as a means to drive loyalty and retention with the lululemon guests. And that's what we'll be sharing is the opportunity of further driving that through synergy and integration and we see a very unique and exciting proposition there. So more on loyalty to come.  And then on reCommerce, we're excited with the test that we did this year. We were in 2 states, California and Texas. We had 80 stores participating. Basic program is gently used, guests can bring in product. They get a gift card on a predetermined dollar rate for the items they bring in. Those go to a third party. Those items, they get washed, they get posted. And we are very encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of not just existing gas bringing in sort of an incentive to clean out the closet and get some of those still very good and quality product into someone else's hands and see them redeem the gift cards, renew their wardrobe and then new guests being acquired through the pricing of the reCommerce product on our website.  So we'll share more of our thinking moving forward. But the program is performing very well. It's meeting and exceeding in terms of its goal, which is getting at current guests to spend more, acquisition of new guests with a more approachable entry price point and supporting our planetary initiatives and offering end-of-life solutions for our guests and being leaders in those goals. So very encouraged more to share in a few weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Congrats on a great quarter. I guess just for coming up on the Analyst Day, I know the SG&A plan for 2023 was about $2 billion. In that, you're on about $6 billion to $6.3 billion of revenues. You did the revenue number this year you pointed out, which is nice to see. But the SG&A was about $2.2 billion, so a little higher than you thought on similar revenues. I know, Calvin, we've talked about this on a few other conference calls.  But some of the big investment buckets in there and especially e-commerce, you had to pull forward to service all the demand you had in 2020. But did you -- I mean, are some of the investments that you were thinking about beyond '23 in the original framework? Have you already started those investments? And then I guess on international margins, you said -- oh sorry, international margins, I think at Analyst Day, last time you said international would quadruple. And then I think you said international margins had just broken even in 2018 and that international will be 10% to 15% of earnings by 2023.  So a lot of margin expansion was baked in at that time. Maybe some of the comments today made it sound like you hit a lot of your domestic targets early, but maybe there's some room left as an opportunity on international. Maybe you could orient us on where the margins are in international where you see the opportunity? Meghan Frank : Michael, it's Meghan. So in terms of SG&A for 2022, so we are really pleased that we are guiding to operating margin that's just modestly under 2019, including the consolidation of MIRROR and then also inclusive of a 280 basis point impact from air freight pressure. We're really focused on optimizing that op margin expansion. And we have made some shifts in our investment profile, so investing more behind digital as we navigated the pandemic, which those expenses hit predominantly in SG&A. And then we pulled back to some degree on new store openings and renovations and saw that benefit within our gross margin.  So confident in our investment profile and that sets us up for long-term sustainable growth, and we'll continue to take that approach going forward. And then in terms of international, we did guide to revenue quadrupling by 2023. So we, as Calvin mentioned, we'll reach that goal in 2022. And then our earnings are on track to what we expected. And overall, I would say our business has performed, overperformed in North America as well. So in terms of overall dollars have reached that goal and penetration may differ slightly. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Mark Altschwager : Congrats on the strong year. So the initial revenue guidance this year is quite a bit ahead of the Power of Three growth targets. And I know we'll need to wait a few weeks here to hear the details on the new 5-year plan. But I'm wondering if we should read from the 2022 guidance that you're confident the business is in a place to sustain this higher level of growth that you've been delivering over the last few years and that you're planning for 2022? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Mark. So at this point in time, until we update in a few weeks, we are maintaining that commitment to the low teens growth rate. We are expecting higher growth this year. We've been talking about -- we thought we had some missed demand in 2021 as we navigated through some supply chain challenges. So feel comfortable with our guide, which is above expectations of 23% to 24% on a 3-year CAGR basis and really broad-based overperformance category, region and channel, and we'll share more work with you in a couple of weeks. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take 1 more question. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Paul Lejuez : Two quick ones. One, just curious if you can share how big you expect the footwear business to be in '22. And second, can you talk about real estate projects that you're planning for '22 beyond just the store openings that you mentioned? How many expansions, relocations, remodels and any data you can provide on the remodels that you've done? Meghan Frank : Paul, it's Meghan. So in terms of footwear, we're not putting a number on 2022 and we'll share more on how we're thinking about that business. It's a small portion. And again, just a test-and-learn category for us. In addition to the 70 new store openings, we are also planning on 35 co-located remodels, which is up from 22 in 2021. So that continues to be a strong strategy for us and allows us to expand our footprint and maximize our revenue opportunity where we have high sales per square foot and help to showcase a broader assortment of our women's and also men's product. Paul Lejuez : And then can you talk about the lift that you see when you do those remodels, both in aggregate, total volume and sales per square foot? Meghan Frank : Yes. We haven't broken out that specifically, but we do see -- we do target those optimizations in areas where the sales per square foot is above our average. And do expect to see a meaningful lift from a revenue perspective, adding on a more meaningful portion of our men's revenue. Operator : Thank you, that's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today and share with you the highlights of our quarter 1 performance. It's been just over a month since I saw many of you in person at our recent Analyst Day presentation in New York. These are exciting times for lululemon as we embark upon our next 5-year growth plan, the Power of Three x2. Our teams are energized and deep in the work of the plan we shared. I look forward to providing you with updates on future earnings calls as we make progress on the key initiatives we laid out. However, I'd like to spend our time today discussing the macro environment and the unique aspects of lululemon, which continue to contribute to our strong performance. As you saw in our press release, the momentum in our business continues and 2022 is off to an impressive start. Revenue in the first quarter increased 32% versus last year and 27% on a 3-year CAGR basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 28% and 26% on the same basis. There are several notable metrics that underscore our performance this quarter. Starting with product, the guest response to our core and new merchandise remains very strong. Our product continues to drive demand, and we experienced robust traffic growth in both channels with stores and e-commerce up approximately 40%. And finally, we're in a strong inventory position relative to last year. While our levels are higher than our historical norms, we are comfortable with the quality and composition of our inventory. This allows us to balance the momentum we're seeing in the business with the challenges that remain within the global supply chain. With that in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes on China, given the current conditions related to COVID-19 and its impact on both our operations and supply chain. Consistent with many retailers in the region, we are seeing modest impacts of the COVID-19-related lockdowns on our stores and with some of our vendors. Throughout the first quarter and into the second quarter, we have seen up to 1/3 of our 71 stores closed for a period of time. As I'm sure you've seen, this week, stores are reopening in Beijing, and we are starting to see restrictions ease in Shanghai. Even with the closures, our business remained solid in the first quarter, with revenue growing double digits versus last year and growing over 60% on a 3-year CAGR basis. In addition, our growth plans remain on track as the majority of our 40 international new store openings this year are planned for Mainland China. From a sourcing perspective, when looking at finished goods for the upcoming fall season, Mainland China represents only 4% to 6% of our total unit volume. When we include trims and other components, the volume increases. Although the majority of our vendors are now up and running, we have experienced delays and expect some level of impact on future receipts. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation, staying in regular contact with our vendors and working to mitigate the current risks. Having said all of this, we remain excited about our business in China, and we view the current situation as short term in nature. Our brand momentum remains strong, and we will continue to invest in the region, and we're excited about what the future holds for lululemon in this important market. When looking at the global supply chain, overall, the environment remains challenging. Ocean lead times are not improving and air freight costs remain high. To address these issues, our team is carefully balancing our business momentum with time line uncertainties to help ensure we meet guest demand. This comes with a commensurate investment in air freight, which is important given we see satisfying guest demand as a priority. Our time lines allow us to pivot when we see trends change from air to ocean and all costs are included in our guidance. We will continue to carefully assess and manage. Switching now to inflation. As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing increased input costs on raw materials, labor and as I just spoke about, air freight. We continue to monitor the situation closely and are taking actions to mitigate the impact on our P&L. These include ongoing cost management, working with our vendor partners to identify additional efficiencies and pricing opportunities. As I've shared previously, we are implementing some select price increases and have not seen any negative impact to our sales volume as a result. However, unlike many in the industry, we do not use promotional pricing as a lever to drive top line sales. Therefore, we are very intentional with our pricing strategies, and we monitor guest response accordingly. That said, I remain cautious around increasing prices in this period of uncertainty, and we will continue to monitor and maintain a measured approach toward this strategy.  Given the times in which we are operating, I wanted to highlight for you the unique strengths of lululemon, which drive our performance quarter after quarter. We have many attributes that make our brand unique, create competitive advantages and lead to the ongoing momentum in our business. As I've shared before, the pandemic has contributed to a fundamental change in guest behaviors that provide us with compelling opportunities to grow. These include our guests wanting to live an active and healthy lifestyle and looking for additional support related to well-being and recovery, and as normalcy returns, their desire for versatile apparel has increased. Plus, our D2C model provides a strong and direct connection to our guests with incredible insights across every touch point. And we have a very balanced approach to growth across channels, geographies, merchandise categories, gender and activities. And finally, our primary focus on technical athletic apparel creates demand for our product across seasons and mitigates the need for markdowns. All of this positions us for continued growth and we will continue to take a balanced and holistic view of our business. In fact, our business is in the early innings and all levers are contributing to our performance. This is unique, speaks to the strength of our brand and our opportunity to innovate, all while maintaining our momentum. Finally, let's look further at our product innovation. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel development platform to solve for the unmet needs of athletes and to bring new technical features into our merchandise assortment. Our foundational principle is when you feel your best, you perform your best. We utilized the Science of Feel to bring a consistent flow of innovation to our assortment across a variety of activities. Our product pipeline remains very strong, and it's the bedrock of the business. In quarter 1, we launched footwear, golf and tennis, all meeting with great guest response. With footwear, we leveraged 20-plus years of experience designing and developing technical apparel to bring a unique solve to the women's footwear space. Many in the industry design footwear for men and then adopt for women. We designed our shoe for women first. We introduced our first shoe, Blissfeel, in March, and we were proud that it was named the best women's specific shoe in 2022 by Runner's World. The response has been enthusiastic. And since we were prudent with our inventory buys, we have seen out of stocks. Although we expect to be in a better inventory position in the coming weeks, demand has far exceeded our sales forecast. As a result, we do anticipate that we will be chasing into additional inventory for the remainder of the year. Turning to our play activities. Golf and tennis both performed well this quarter. These collections are comprised of pieces from our core assortment as well as styles designed specifically for these activities. This strategy allows us to manage our assortment, grow share of wallet while also leveraging our core and driving sales. We are pleased with these results and will continue to lean into these strategies. Looking ahead into quarter 2, we have several exciting product stories to tell. First is SenseKnit. To continue expanding our run apparel assortment, this week, we launched our newest fabric innovation. After 4 years of research and development, we have brought to market SenseKnit, a proprietary fabric that seamlessly engineers zones of support, breathability and mobility directly into the fabric. Based upon collaborative work with our ambassadors and athletes, we determined the sensation runners are looking with unrestricted lightweight support while also delivering the technical performance and endurance they expect from lululemon. And our SenseKnit collection provides this sensation in 9 styles for men and women. Second is hike. To leverage the versatility of our core as we've done with golf and tennis, we're on track to launch hike in the coming weeks. This assortment will combine elements of our core assortment with new styles designed specifically for hiking. This is an unmet need we heard from our guests specifically as hiking has gained popularity during the pandemic. Next is throwbacks. Our product team has been spending time in our archives to find the best of the best and re-release limited additions of some of our guests' favorite styles, including revamped versions of our Astro Pants, Shape Jacket and Inspire Crop. And finally, footwear, as I mentioned, we are excited with the initial response. We just launched our second style, the Restfeel slide this week, and we remain on track to roll out our next 2 styles later this year, Chargefeel and Strongfeel. This is just the beginning for us within this category, which has considerable opportunity. So in summary, our results and our guidance demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our brand. This is enabled by our omni operating model, our product innovation and our balanced approach to growth. We have shown our ability to successfully manage through what's happening around us, and I am continually inspired by how our teams around the globe consistently deliver for our guests, for each other and for our stakeholders. With that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'll begin by saying how excited I was to host our recent Analyst Day and get to meet and speak with many of you in person. As we delivered early on our total 2023 revenue goals, we used Analyst Day to launch our growth plan for the next 5 years. Our new plan builds upon our proven Power of Three formula and calls for a doubling of total revenue from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion in 2026. Hence, we've appropriately named the new plan, Power of Three x2. Our teams are already executing against our new plan, and we're off to a solid start despite the ongoing headwinds in the macro environment. So let me now share with you the details on our Q1 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q1 2022 with Q1 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q1 2021 exclude approximately $8 million of MIRROR acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q1, total net revenue increased 32% to $1.613 billion, ahead of our guidance, driven by outperformance in North America. Comparable sales increased 29% with a 24% increase in stores and a 33% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 27%, an acceleration from Q4. In our store channel, sales increased 36% on a 1-year basis and 13% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity was above 2019 levels and continues to trend that way to date in Q2. On average, we had 98% of our stores open throughout Q1. We currently have 97% open with current closures related predominantly to the impact of COVID-19 in China. Square footage increased 16% versus last year driven by the addition of 56 net new stores since Q1 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new stores and completed 4 co-located optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 51% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $721 million of top line or 45% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 26% and within international, we saw a 37% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 30% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 24% and accessories grew 43% on the same basis. I'm also excited with what we're seeing in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased over 40%, while at the same time, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased nearly 40%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up over 10% in stores and nearly 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Gross profit for the first quarter was $870 million or 53.9% of net revenue compared to 57.1% of net revenue in Q1 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 320 basis points relative to last year was driven by a 370 basis point decrease in product margin. Q1 product margin included an increase of approximately 340 basis points in air freight related to macro supply chain challenges, which was higher than our guidance of 300 basis points due to increased usage relative to our initial plans. Markdowns were approximately flat with last year. Relative to 2019, markdowns decreased by 40 basis points. We also experienced 10 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 60 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, driven by occupancy and depreciation. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $608 million or 37.7% of net revenue compared to 40.5% of net revenue in Q1 2021. Leverage in the quarter versus Q1 2021 resulted from leverage in our store and digital channels, somewhat offset by increased investments in the corporate SG&A and depreciation. Operating income for the quarter was $260 million or 16.1% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 16.4% in Q1 2021 and inclusive of approximately 340 basis points of additional air freight expense. Tax expense for the quarter was $70 million or 27% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.5% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of our fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings. Net income for the quarter was $190 million or $1.48 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.16 in Q1 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $111 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the first quarter last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $649 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 74% versus last year and was $1.3 billion at the end of Q1. We continue to strategically use air freight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues and support our top line momentum, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic. On a 3-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 36% relative to 2019 at the end of Q1 and is well positioned relative to our Q2 2022 top line guidance of a 26% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis, again, comparing to 2019. It's important to mention that due to ocean transit times, our in-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 5 percentage points to the 3-year unit CAGR of 36%. I'd also mention that we likely have less guest demand on the table last year as we were under inventory due to supply chain issues. Hence, our product teams have taken this into account as they plan receipts for this year. We also continue to leverage our core assortment, which comprises approximately 45% of our inventory. Looking forward, we expect to see the highest 1 year inventory growth rate of the year in Q2 on both a dollar and unit basis before levels begin to moderate in Q3. In Q2, inventory dollar growth relative to last year will be modestly above levels at the end of Q1. On a 3-year CAGR basis, unit growth will remain up approximately 36%. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of approximately $328. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $955 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program. Let me shift now to our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2022. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion, representing 1 year growth of 21% to 22% and a 3-year CAGR of approximately 26%. We expect to open 20 net new company-operated stores in Q2. We expect gross margin in Q2 to be down approximately 200 basis points relative to Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 guidance includes an impact of approximately 150 basis points of pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. In Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to be relatively flat with Q2 2021. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.87 versus adjusted EPS of $1.65 a year ago. Our range of $1.82 to $1.87 excludes the $0.07 gain on a real estate sale we expect to realize in Q2. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenues to be in the range of $7.61 billion to $7.71 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the high teens to low 20s relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 24% to 25%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new Power of Three x2 growth plan. We continue to expect to open approximately 70 net new company-operated stores in 2022. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 40 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 100 to 150 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven by increased investment in our DC network and a strategic increase in content development costs for lululemon studio, MIRROR. The increased costs and gross margin will be offset by a reduction in digital marketing, which flows through SG&A. In addition, we now expect air freight to have a modest negative impact of approximately 30 basis points versus our prior expectation of flat. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We are forecasting leverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021, driven by increased sales and the shift in lululemon studio, MIRROR, investments I just mentioned. And when looking at operating margin for the full year 2022, we now expect it to be approximately flat with last year, inclusive of the 30 basis points of incremental air freight expense I just mentioned. For the full year 2022, we now expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.35 to $9.50 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on a real estate sale we expect to realize in Q2. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects the increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Our range of $600 million to $625 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. As you can see from our results, lululemon continues to deliver the kind of performance that sets us apart within the retail industry. Two weeks ago, we held our Annual Leadership Summit and brought together virtually about 2,000 of our leaders from around the globe. We detailed our Power of Three x2 growth plans and spoke to our culture at lululemon and to our purpose, which is to elevate human potential by helping people feel their best. And the passion from every participant, the enthusiasm during every breakout was simply incredible. It reinforces my confidence in all that lies ahead for lululemon as we both navigate what uncertainty emerges and work toward delivering on our goals to double our business within the next 5 years. It's an honor to lead this incredible organization. And now we'll take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats on another really nice quarter. So Calvin, what I thought was striking about this quarter was the consistency, meaning across the 27% top line CAGR, you delivered strength across men's, women's, international and North America. So maybe could you help speak to the momentum of the brand versus maybe the expansion of the overall TAM, what you think is really driving it? Any comments on May to start the second quarter? And then just how best to think about your ability to chase upside demand relative to the inventory that you have? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matthew. Well, I think it -- as you know, and you've heard me say before, we're in early innings of growth, and we continue to experience balanced growth across all of our levers, gender, activity, category, channel and markets. And Q1 was no different. And it plays to our product innovation, plays to where we are in the opportunity and penetration across all of those levers and how we still have room to grow women's while we're working to double our men's business, similar in our physical retail store footprint as we double digital and internationally with our momentum and growth in North America. So it's the narrative that we've been sharing and working towards continues to play out. And as we look forward to future quarters into the future years and doubling our business, it's where we gain the confidence in our ability, knowing what we can continue to create and see that balance across all levers inside the organization. And when I do look forward in the product pipeline, I feel very good that we continue to bring innovation into our own categories of run, train and yoga. We saw a lot of success. We just launched SenseKnit, as you might have seen in the last few days, which is a wonderful new innovation and fabric to help further our strength and run. And the launch of our play activities in the last quarter with the golf and tennis, one, achieved the goal of driving credibility in those activities as well as lifting the core. So I'm very excited about how product is resonating in the pipeline for new innovation and have a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see those growth opportunities as we move forward. Meghan Frank : And Matt, I'd just add to that in terms of May, I think we're pleased with the continued momentum in our business as reflected in our 26% 3-year CAGR guide for Q2. And then in terms of inventory relationship to the sales as the year progresses, we feel really comfortable with our inventory position as we move into Q2. The team has done a nice job pulling forward inventory to meet our demand. And we are guiding to 24% to 25% for the full year, a little bit more conservative in the second half, given we have more of a line of sight clearly to Q2 and some of the macro uncertainty in front of us. I feel well positioned overall. Matthew Boss : Congrats again. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : I guess just first, with respect to the updated guidance. It's great to see the momentum. You raised the high end of the guidance both on sales and earnings kind of more than flowing through the Q1 upside with some -- even with some of the incremental macro headwinds that you and others are facing out there. So I was hoping you could just unpack that a bit more. I guess what has changed regarding the plan for the remainder of the year relative to a couple of months ago? And how do you feel about the various levers you have in the business? Should there be perhaps some incremental choppiness with kind of broader consumer demand? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Mark. So in terms of our guide for the second quarter, we obviously have line of sight to the second quarter at this point in time, 26% 3-year CAGR and then it's a little more conservative for the second half of the year, but feeling like our Q1 momentum is flowing into Q2, so comfortable flowing through some upside there. As I mentioned, we do have a little bit of incremental air freight pressure for the year, which we've reported in our guidance. And overall EPS raise also reflects some benefit from tax rate. In terms of leverage, as we move throughout the year, as we've been employing over the last couple of years, we're running multiple scenarios to ensure we're able to meet guest demand as it comes and remaining flexible, pushing in on air freight, but also being flexible there and matching that with demand as well. So certainly using that muscle that we developed throughout the last couple of years in terms of how agile we are in meeting our guest demand. Mark Altschwager : And I apologize if I missed this, but could you give us just a little bit more perspective on kind of China, what you're seeing quarter-to-date? I know it's just kind of a mid-ish single-digit percent of your sales, but with the store closures you mentioned, I guess, where is that tracking and what is incorporated in your guidance in terms having -- getting those trends back to full productivity? Meghan Frank : Yes. In terms of China, we have approximately 20% of our close -- of our stores closed currently. So 15 out of 71, primarily in Shanghai and Beijing. We've taken that into account in our guidance. We did have 8 of our 10 stores in Beijing reopen this week, and we're also seeing restrictions begin to ease in Shanghai. And the overall impact of that revenue in Q1 was more than made up by strength in other regions. And we're seeing, I would say, overall, the situation improve there. Also keeping a close eye, I would say, on sourcing. A small percentage of our total unit volume comes out of China, but continue to monitor closely there. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Just on the inventory, Calvin, Meghan, can you maybe just talk a little bit more on -- are there pockets where -- of categories where you feel like you have a little bit too much? Is it broad-based? Like I'm looking at men's, women's, some of the ancillary newer categories, just is there any area where there's a little bit more than others? And then does this change any of your thought on potential markdown cadence into 2Q and the rest of the year? I know -- and I think, Meghan, you said markdowns were flat in Q1, but kind of curious what your thinking is rest of the year. Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Ike. So in terms of inventory, I'd say we feel well positioned. If anything, there might be some pockets of inventory where we wish we had a little bit more just given the dynamic nature of the environment and certainly have been where possible pushing into core inventory, which is about 45% of our assortment and doesn't come with attached markdown liability.  As I mentioned, Q1, so markdowns were relatively flat year-over-year and then 40 basis points down to 2019. We don't -- we feel confident in our top line trend going into Q2 at a 26% 3-year CAGR and well aligned with our inventory growth when adjusting for the in-transit piece on a unit basis and have no plans to change the markdown cadence of our business as we look throughout the year. Operator : The next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Great. This is Alex Straton on for Kimberly Greenberger. I just wanted to ask a quick question. There's all this chatter in the market and some signs we're seeing a slowdown, at least on the lower end consumer. But your results don't suggest there's any weakness across your customer base. So maybe could you talk to if you see any signs of weakness across in certain regions or in certain customer demographics? And can you also just remind us of what the average kind of household income is of a lulu customer? Calvin McDonald : Alex, it's Calvin. In terms of the question on health of guest and how we're seeing their spending behavior, I think I got part of my answer out, so I'm going to take it from the beginning. We feel very good about the health of our guests. New guest acquisition has been very strong, current guest spending has been strong, both contributing to the momentum and the growth of the company. We shared with you our traffic numbers, both in-store and online, very healthy. Again, another good indicator of a very engaged guest. We did not experience any real benefit from the stimulus checks last year. And hence, we did not see any material impact as we cycled over that earlier this spring. So as we look forward, we continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions, but Q1, beginning Q2, see very healthy guest metrics and remain optimistic how our guest is engaging in this category, the versatility of this product and where it prioritizes in their spend and their needs for every day. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to focus on gross margin for a minute. It looks like the 2Q guidance is a little better and full year a little worse, so maybe you could go through some of the moving parts there? And then I was wondering if you could offer some insight on how much of these air freight pressures you expect to recoup in both the fourth quarter and then throughout 2023? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, so in terms of gross margin, we're guiding to 200 basis points of pressure in Q2 and then approximately 100 to 150 basis point decline for the full year. The second quarter does include 150 basis points of air freight pressure year-over-year. And then we also have increased our outlook for the year in terms of air freight pressure to 30 basis points. We previously had that as flat. When we look at -- just I would note the operating margin for the full year, it's modestly under 2019, even inclusive of a 300 basis point impact from air freight pressure. So as you say, I think we see that moderating over the long term and certainly see opportunity to recoup that. But at this point in time, I think the supply chain pressures will be with us for the balance of 2022. We'll continue to keep you updated and obviously closely monitoring the environment, and the team continues to balance those decisions, as Calvin mentioned, with our revenue momentum. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I'd like to get your perspective on how you're thinking about consumer wallet share shifts between categories and how consumers are dressing now versus they may have dressed last year. How are you looking to ensure that the brand remains agile as these consumer preferences shift into a potentially living-with-COVID world? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. I think the most important factor is core to our product assortment is versatile performance apparel where, although used at times for versatility around the house, our gear is designed for activity-based use. And that we saw an uptick through the pandemic. It has continued as that behavior of activity, outdoor sweats, lifestyle has continued. So that is the essence of the brand and what drives our innovation through our key categories of yoga, run and train as well as our play activities. And that continues as strong now as it was through the pandemic. And with the innovation we have in the pipeline and what I shared and what we've seen through Q1 into Q2, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to grow the assortments in our sales as a result of that. In men's, we have a very strong OTM business, which starts to factor into that lifestyle between to and from the studio. And we're excited about the opportunity to grow that within our women's assortment. But we're seeing strong performance in those categories as well as they do play to trends that have happened in general of how people are choosing versatile functional apparel for every day. But I think the core is we are a performance-based athletic brand. We are supporting our guests in their sweat activities and that is driving the momentum and growth of the business during the pandemic and post and continues to be the biggest fuel of our momentum. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Guys, can you give us an update on what you're seeing on your average unit costs for the second half and also into the first half of '23. And I'm curious, Calvin, I think you mentioned some cautiousness about passing through higher prices. Curious to how much you're willing to absorb versus what you might look to pass through to customers. And then second question, I think you mentioned 60 basis points of leverage on occupancy this quarter. Just curious what your comp leverage point is on the occupancy line at this point? Meghan Frank : Paul, so in terms of AUC, if I put air freight aside, we're seeing modest increases in raw material prices. So no material change in our underlying AUC and continue to closely monitor those impacts, closely working with our suppliers and as we look into 2023. In terms of pricing, we're taking modest price increases on about 10% of our assortment. As we said before, we strategically look at prices in terms of quality and make of our goods and the competitive landscape, and we'll continue to use that as a strategy as we move forward. In terms of occupancy, I think overall, our top line trend, obviously, very strong at the 27% 3-year sales CAGR. And leveraging occupancy to a large degree, given our outperformance on top line as well as the strength of our e-commerce business. We haven't broken out the leverage point, but continue to see opportunity on that line item as we move throughout 2022. Paul Lejuez : And just one quick follow-up. Could you just remind me what percent of your raw materials are petroleum-based, somehow tied to the oil -- price of oil? Meghan Frank : We haven't quite broken that out, but I can follow up with some additional information. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Just one quick housekeeping. Meghan, I think you said, to Lorraine's question earlier, I think air freight in first quarter was 340 basis points of pressure, 150 basis points of pressure in 2Q. To get to the 30 basis points of pressure for the year, you're baking in positive leverage in the second half. And I know the comparison as you started paying for air freight last year helps. I just want to make sure I heard that because it sounded like to Lorraine you were saying maybe it would take quite some time to get back some of the air cost -- air freight costs. And then, Calvin, I guess, bigger picture, one thing that jumps out here is the e-commerce business actually accelerating versus the prior quarter on a 3-year basis. I can't say we've seen that dynamic with other brands. There's been a pretty pronounced trend of e-commerce slowing as consumers go back to stores. Aside from just good old-fashioned execution, anything to point out specific in that channel that you think is helping you guys kind of go the other direction of the industry? Meghan Frank : Michael, I'll take the first part of that question. So in terms of air freight, we are up against some increases last year as we move into the second half of the year. So expect the air freight impact to be a leverage point in Q4 when we look on a 1-year basis. But I would say in terms of how we're looking at the future, I think coming off of the full year air freight, I think too early to say on '23 how we see that moderating, but do expect to have a leverage point as we lap the high water line in Q4 of last year. Calvin McDonald : And on our online performance, I think it's a number of factors. As you said, the growth continues to be very strong, cycling over some very large numbers. I'll start by just talking about our store performance and the productivity in our stores were above 2019 levels. So the benefit is the success in e-commerce is incremental and not coming at the expense of our store productivity numbers. And we are seeing our stores perform back to and above where they were in 2019 as guests continue to come in. And as I mentioned, traffic in both stores and online were very healthy and continue to be very strong moving forward. Specifically online, I think there are a couple of factors. One, as you know, we pulled forward some investments. That was a combination of foundational as well as guest experience initiatives, both in how we merchandise some of our shops. The team has done a lot of good work around just basic efficiency, on checkout efficiency, reducing friction, a lot of the guest-facing initiatives like the online concierge and educator. And it boils down to also product. We saw a very strong engagement on our footwear category through our online channel. Newness around golf and tennis traditionally performs very well in the channel. And we've spent a lot of time in building an omni guest relationship. And I think they are shopping both store and online and when online, they're really diving into the newness early, quickly to ensure they secure it, yet still engaging in our store channel. So it's a combination of a lot of initiatives that we've been building, the team has been utilizing and product is definitely the primary or one of the key drivers of it. But it's boiling down to that behavior and that omni-guest relationship that we've been nurturing and building for the last few years. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Let me add my congratulations. Product looks fantastic. Calvin, I was wondering if you could share your insights on what have you learned from the capsule launches in tennis, golf and footwear? They were obviously stocked out very early. You're waiting for some replenishment there. So how have these launches informed you about the next iteration for footwear and other new categories like hike? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Adrienne. A couple of things, and I'll start with footwear and then I'll move into some of the play capsules that we launched. With footwear, as we've shared, it's a test-and-learn category for us. We're excited about it. We think it's an exciting opportunity for the brand moving forward, and we're going to take a test-and-learn approach, which meant we sort of went in knowing that demand would be in excess of supply and it far exceeded our expectations. And we definitely had a lot more demand than we anticipated. Encouraging, but definitely impacted supply quicker than we would have wanted in an ideal scenario, but it all points to an incredible product that was well received both in the industry and with the guest. And the team is focused on learning and adapting. What's challenged that a little bit is the global supply chain challenges, and we're not going to pay to fly in footwear. So we're going to build the category and we're going to learn as we go. But we'll be back in stock on Blissfeel this month. But we expect that we'll be going through these periods as we have some incredible colors coming that we expect the guests will resonate with. We have our slides in both men's and women's that dropped this week, and we've already seen a very positive response to that. And then Chargefeel and Strongfeel will launch later this summer and fall. So we're excited about how the guest is responding and the teams are learning, and I think it's a very positive indication of our ability and the elasticity of our brand to extend into categories, really offer a head-to-toe solution and when we deliver on unmet needs. And golf and tennis really fit into that where we design a small percentage of products that are designed specifically for those activities. And then we also leverage our core assortment to drive versatile opportunity and solutions as well as activities, and both performed incredibly well, as you indicated. I mean having Leylah Fernandez as our ambassador on our tennis has been fantastic. And leveraging golf during both the Masters and the PGA Championships in the future is a wonderful opportunity to put a spotlight on our product and our assortment, and in hike. So team's learning. It's one of those indications where I think Meghan said we wish we had more, but it's delivering both sales in those products and lifting our core, which is the strategy, and it's resonating, and it's working well in both guest acquisition and expanding share of wallet with our existing guests. So we're excited about how the guests responded and with newness happening in this quarter and the rest of the year. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Congrats on a great quarter and momentum. Maybe I wanted to go back to the supply chain and Paul's average unit cost question. I guess where are there offsets for you in what's a rising supply chain cost environment? Obviously, some of the air freight will come down in the back half. Your markdown rates are very low, and you've got pricing power. But where are the areas to offset within the supply chain and what looks like an inflationary environment into 2023? Meghan Frank : Yes. So I'd say there, to date, we've seen modest increases in terms of raw material prices. And we have started taking some price increases in Q1, as I said, modest and will be less than 10% of our assortment. We haven't seen any price resistance to date. And we'll continue to have a few actions as we roll throughout the year there. So we'll continue to look at that as a lever.  I think when we look at our operating margin overall, we are modestly for the year under 2019, even with that 300 basis point pressure of air freight. So I feel as that environment moderates, we should have some opportunity in front of us in terms of recouping the air freight pressure. And we continue to look across our business in terms of opportunities to deliver on our 5-year average target of modest operating margin expansion, obviously, navigating those near-term challenges with air freight and ensuring importantly that we continue to drive the momentum in our business through key investments as well. John Kernan : Understood. Maybe one quick follow-up on inventory. As we all look at inventory balances across the sector, some of your peers in the competitive set, inventory dollars and units are up pretty meaningfully at this point. I guess, just the confidence in the ability to maintain full price sell-through, confidence in the competitive sets, ability to maintain full price sell-through as we go into Q3, Q4 and what's going to be much higher inventory levels throughout the sector into the holiday. Meghan Frank : Yes. So I think when we look at our inventory on a 1-year basis, the rate -- the growth rate includes air freight impacts and then also higher in-transit with those longer ocean durations. And then also, we're comparing to periods of being under inventory last year. So that would have been relevant for Q1 of 2021. We feel the most relevant way to look at inventory as we navigate these supply chain disruptions and the comparisons to the pandemic period is to look at the 3-year unit CAGR. And that is really consistent with how we're looking at planning our business.  So that 3-year unit CAGR for us at the end of Q1 was up 36%, 5 points impact included in that for longer in-transit time. So adjusting for that 31% unit increase, we think, is well aligned with our top line momentum. So when we look at that 3-year revenue CAGR, it's 27% in Q1 and then 26% in terms of our Q2 guide. And then I'd say, still really pleased with full price momentum. Our markdowns in Q1 were relatively flat year-over-year, still 40 basis points below 2019. So really looking at leveraging also the core and nonseasonal nature of our business, which is about 45% of our assortment as well. We tend to have low markdowns overall and don't see a change to that posture as we move throughout the year. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I wanted to dive in a little bit deeper in China. I know it's still a relatively small piece of the pie for you guys, but a huge part of the long-term growth algorithm. Putting aside the current kind of COVID lockdowns and things going on there, maybe talk about what's changed for the brand in China? That's been, I think, well over 10 years in the Greater China market at least. There seems to be some sort of inflection going on. Maybe dive in deeper what's going on with that brand and that consumer in that market through the premium and athleisure and athletic wear market. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Omar. I think we've shared that even with the challenges that you alluded to, our year-over-year growth was still double digit in China and our 3-year CAGR is 60%. So there's definitely strong momentum behind the brand and very excited about the rest of this year and moving forward. These are short-term operational challenges. We've lived this in North America and other markets. We continue to support our teams as we did around the globe in these markets through pay protection, investing in the culture and that's important because that to me is one of the big pillars that's driving the success of the brand. We have incredibly engaged educators and talent at our SSC in Shanghai. We're investing in people and talent. We're investing in relationships with the community and our ambassador community within that market. And the product, like it is in other regions, is resonating. It's uniquely positioned. It's differentiated as a premium product. When you get a chance to go to the market, you'll see we're positioned differently in malls. We're positioned differently in terms of how the guest is interacting with the product. And similar to other markets, the same activity strategy is working. The innovation is working. The dual gender is working. So we definitely are excited about -- do agree there's been an inflection in the brand that's been building for the last few years. And this is just a short-term operational challenge that many of us are faced with, but the health of the brand is very strong and bodes well for our future growth plans. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Nikic with Wedbush Securities. Tom Nikic : It sounds like you're pretty happy with some of the new categories you've entered, footwear, the golf and tennis capsules, et cetera, and you got kind of more coming down the pipe. Is there any concern on your part about kind of selling too much stuff at your customer in a short period of time, adding footwear and some of these new categories and hike and new fabrication, et cetera? How do you kind of make sure that the storytelling is there and the experience is there to help the customer kind of navigate through all these new product offerings that you're getting on? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Tom. Focusing on storytelling and bringing the guests along with our product innovation journey is definitely a key focus of Nikki and the team, both the merchants, how we tell the story online and how we tell it through the brand, through our relationships that we build with our ambassadors. So it is absolutely a key focus. I'm not worried for a few reasons. One, it is minimal in SKU proliferation, which is designed and deliberate because we know we have highly productive stores, versatile product and we want to continue that. It is a big differentiator of our brand versus most others in this space. And we selectively target a small number of innovative products designed for these activities as a means to grow the overall core. So in many cases, it's how our guests are already sweating and using our product. We are just putting a brand story on it with a small number of design for products that validates, brings credibility already to the product and lifts it. Second, we focused on categories because we know it's how our guests sweat in our product, and it is their primary and secondary go-to activities. So we are delivering them innovative products that through our approach, Science of Feel and unmet needs in the activities that they are sweating and we're just extending the relationship for a brand that they have affinity and trust and confidence in, in delivering products that satisfies how they're choosing to sweat. So we're not stepping outside of the relationship we already have with guests. We are not stepping outside of how they're already sweating in our product, and we're designing specifically into that and leveraging our overall core. And then finally, what I'd say is the immediate response to all this incremental key activities or categories or items, be it footwear, tennis and golf were incredibly strong, which to me just validates the need, the immediate response and reaction, and I'm excited, encouraged with hiking. We know when we bring innovative product that delivers on an unmet need that's focused on these core activities that are the strength of the relationship that he and she has with the brand, it resonates. And I think the results -- well, I know the results validated that. It's a strategy we're going to continue to roll out in the coming quarters. Tom Nikic : Sounds good. And I love seeing J.R. Smith as one of your golf ambassadors. Calvin McDonald : Thank you. Operator : That's all the time that we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under our Investors section of our website at www.lulemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the second quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I am excited to be here today to highlight our second quarter results and the continued momentum we're experiencing at lululemon. While the external environment around us has been challenging, we are seeing our guests respond strongly to our product innovations, our community activations and our omni operating model, which allows us to meet and exceed their expectations. During the next few minutes, I will discuss the factors that are driving our broad-based strength. Next, I'll discuss the current supply chain environment, then our pipeline of product innovation, and I'll conclude with an update on our growth within the international business. As you've seen from our press release, the momentum in our business remained strong in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% versus last year and 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis representing an acceleration from quarter 1. Adjusted earnings per share increased 33% and 32% on the same basis. And based on our guidance, we anticipate a high level of performance to continue in quarter 3. These results are even more compelling considering the difficult macroeconomic environment in which we are operating. Our performance was only possible because of our teams across the globe. Their dedication, their agility and their enthusiasm for our brand, which enable us to consistently deliver for our guests and report these above-plan financial results. Meghan will share the detailed performance metrics with you shortly, but I'd like to give you my perspective on what's driving the strength and specifically speak to guest engagement. Given the current macro backdrop, we have been looking closely at our guest data and metrics to identify any shifts in spending patterns, behaviors or habits. And to date, I'm pleased to show that we are not seeing any meaningful variation in cohort behavior or the metrics we track in this area of the business. New guest acquisition remains strong with transactions by first-time guests increasing over 20% in quarter 2. Transactions by existing guests increased in the high teens. Traffic across channels remains robust with store traffic up over 30% and e-commerce traffic increasing over 40%. And importantly, we are not creating this traffic through markdowns or price promotions. lululemon remains predominantly a full-price business, and we have not changed our promotional cadence or markdown strategy and we have no plans to do so. While we haven't seen anything on our internal dashboards to suggest any changes, we continue to monitor our guest behavior closely, and we remain agile in how we plan the business. Shifting topics, like others in the industry, we continue to navigate challenges throughout the supply chain. That said, we are pleased to see some promising signs of improvement yet recognize further normalization within the supply chain will take some time. We currently have no closures across our vendor base. And in China, vendors who had to close their slow production in quarter 1 due to COVID-19 are beginning to catch up. Ocean delivery times are improving, although they remain significantly elevated compared to the pre-COVID period. And while we continue to strategically leverage airfreight to help ensure timely delivery of product into our distribution centers, we are seeing these rates begin to come down. In terms of inventory, we remain comfortable with both our quality and quantity, and we are well positioned for the fall season. As you recall, for much of last year, we were under-inventoried and not able to fully maximize our business. This year, we are in a much better position to deliver product innovation to our guests wherever and however they shop with us. We remain in the early innings of our growth and we have multiple levers that we can pull to continue our momentum, particularly when looking at product. In quarter 2, we drove expansion across our core play and new categories. Let me now share some highlights of our recent and upcoming product innovations. In our core product categories, we launched SenseKnit, our new proprietary fabric technology offering zone compression for runners and we saw great success in our core scuba and define franchises for women and in our ABC and commission franchises for men. Switching now to our play categories. Our strategy is to solve for our guests' unmet needs across their secondary sweat activities such as golf, tennis and hike. We roll out targeted innovations while also leveraging the versatility of our core assortment. This not only builds our credibility within the activity, but it also allows us to drive overall sales while effectively managing SKUs. Our hike collection, which we launched in quarter 2, is another example of how we are executing our play strategy well. Hike is an activity that grew in popularity with guests during the pandemic, and we are excited to now be able to serve our guests as they hit the trails. We are thrilled by the early reaction to our hike collection with strong response from both guests and the media. And finally, let me update you on footwear. Blissfeel, the first style we launched in March, continues to perform well. We improved our inventory position after the strong guest response at launch, and we're seeing continued excitement around this technical running shoe. In quarter 2, we launched our next 2 footwear styles : Restfeel, our dual gender slide; and Chargefeel, our hybrid training shoe for women. Similar to Blissfeel, Chargefeel was designed specifically for women. Our teams developed a dynamic workout shoe to be used across a wide range of training activities, and we're excited about the initial response from both the media and our guests. Looking forward, our pipeline of innovation remains robust, and I'm excited with what the teams have developed for the second half of the year, including a further expansion of apparel for run with new styles offering heat retention and reflective detailing to enable outdoor runs in cooler and low light conditions as the season shift. With the exception of a few outerwear styles and accessories, we've never had a [ solve ] for cold weather runs. The upcoming expansion of our assortment is a great example of the ongoing opportunity to build out our core categories and provide new solutions for our guests. Next, we will continue to expand our new hike category to include heavier styles to protect against the elements during cold weather outings. We will also continue our throwback strategy with the relaunch of our popular unicorn tears print in select styles. This print has not been available since 2012 and has been one of the most requested by our guests, and we're thrilled to be bringing it back for a limited time. And finally, we'll launch our fourth footwear style, Strongfeel, a technical training shoe designed to keep the foot anchored and secured during multidirectional training workouts. While our product is clearly a key point of differentiation, our direct-to-consumer model also provides us with a compelling competitive advantage. Our own channels, both brick-and-mortar and digital, allow us to connect directly with our guests, foster deeper relationships and engage with them in many ways beyond just a purchase transaction. During the pandemic, we evolved our approach and developed new ways to connect digitally with our guests and communities. Now as we're moving into post-COVID world, we're once again connecting with our guests in person while also continuing to leverage new ways to engage digitally. Our new 2-tier membership program, which we'll be launching shortly, is a perfect example of our ability to connect with guests in new ways. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, we will be rolling out a free program that will offer members benefits across the lululemon ecosystem, and we will be evolving MIRROR into lululemon studio, which will represent the paid tier of the program. Community connection is at the core of lululemon. Our ongoing outreach and engagement with our guests not only deepen our relationship, but also drive purchases. I'm particularly excited with the opportunity we have in front of us with our new membership program in lululemon studio to activate our community and enhance the connection to our guests across both our physical and digital platforms. Before turning it over to Meghan to discuss our quarter 2 financials and guidance outlook, let me share some insights into our international business. Overall momentum in our international business remains strong, with revenue increasing 35% versus last year and 40% on a 3-year CAGR basis. In China, after a slower start to the year given COVID-19-related closures and capacity constraints, we have seen a rebound in the region. Revenue grew over 30% versus last year, and we saw a nearly 70% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis. We remain in the early innings of growth in China and consistent with our approach in all other markets, we are leveraging our D2C model to grow our brand and attract new guests. In quarter 2, in our brick-and-mortar channel, we opened 8 stores in China Mainland. We now operate 40 stores in Tier 1 cities, 25 stores in Tier 2 cities and 14 stores in Tier 3 cities and continue to see strength across this entire portfolio. In our e-commerce channel, we recently launched a digital flagship store on JD.com, a leading online retailer in China. JD's customer base skews more heavily towards men and represents a compelling new guest acquisition tool for us as we continue to grow our brand in the region. I'm also thrilled with how our local teams continue to build community, increase our brand awareness and deepen the relationship we have with our guests. A great illustration of this is our summer sweat games 2022. This event saw more than 2,000 guests participate in over 60 events in 20 cities across the China Mainland. Activities included outdoor yoga, dancing and surfing experiences. In addition, more than 100,000 guests participated in sweat sessions offered by our ambassadors on Keep, a leading fitness app in China. Shifting now to Europe, where our momentum is also strong, revenue increased 20% and 22% on a 1- and 3-year CAGR basis, respectively. We are all excited that lululemon is entering Spain, our first new market in the region in 3 years. Our local e-commerce site is up and running, and our first 2 stores in Barcelona and Madrid are gearing up to open shortly, and we expect Spain to be a strong market for us going forward. In total, we are now operating 40 stores and 5 websites in Europe. International expansion is one of the key pillars of our Power of Three x2 growth plan, which calls for a quadrupling of our business from 2021 levels by the end of 2026, and we are off to a great start. With that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'm pleased that we continue to see broad-based strength across our business. Traffic to both our stores and digital channels is strong and guests are responding well to our product innovations. We're in a better inventory position relative to last year, which is also helping to drive our top line strength. And looking at Q3, we're happy with the start to the fall season, which is reflected in the updated guidance I'll take you through shortly. Let me now share with you the details of our Q2 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q2 2022 and Q2 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q2 2022 exclude a $0.06 gain related to the disposition of an office building, while the adjusted operating results for Q2 2021 excludes $0.06 of expense related to the acquisition of MIRROR. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q2, total net revenue increased 29% to $1.87 billion, ahead of our guidance. Comparable sales increased 25% with an 18% increase in stores and a 32% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 28%, an acceleration from our 27% 3-year CAGR in Q1. In our store channel, sales increased 30% on a 1-year basis and 16% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity continues to trend above 2019 levels. On average, we had 98% of our stores opened throughout Q2, and we currently have 99% open. We ended the quarter with a total of 600 stores across the globe, a milestone we are all extremely proud of. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 66 net new stores since Q2 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 21 net new stores and completed 6 co-located optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 53% on a 3-year CAGR basis. We contributed $775 million of top line or 42% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 26%. And within international, we saw a 40% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 30% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 25% and accessories grew 50% on the same basis. I'm also excited that we continue to see strength in traffic across both channels. And stores traffic increased over 30% on top of the 150% increase in traffic we experienced last year. And in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased over 40%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 8% in stores and over 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.06 billion or 56.5% of net revenue compared to 58.1% of net revenue in Q2 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 160 basis points relative to last year was driven primarily by a 150 basis point decrease in product margin. Q2 product margin included an increase of approximately 130 basis points in airfreight related to macro supply chain challenges, which was slightly better than our guidance of 150 basis points. Markdowns were 30 basis points higher than Q2 2021, given low inventory levels and out of stocks last year. Relative to 2019, markdowns are flat. We also experienced 40 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 30 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, driven primarily by occupancy and depreciation. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $662 million or 35.4% of net revenue compared to 37.3% of net revenue in Q2 2021. Leverage in the quarter versus Q2 2021 resulted from leverage in our store and digital channels and modest leverage on foreign exchange, somewhat offset by increased investments in corporate SG&A and depreciation. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $391 million or 20.9% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 20.6% in Q2 2021 and inclusive of approximately 130 basis points of additional airfreight expense. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $110 million or 28.2% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.9% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of our fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $281 million or $2.20 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.65 in Q2 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $145 million for the quarter compared to $80 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $499 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 85% versus last year and was $1.46 billion at the end of Q2. We continue to strategically use airfreight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues and support our top line momentum, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic. On a 3-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 38% relative to 2019 at the end of Q2. In-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 2 percentage points to the 3-year unit CAGR of 38%. I'd also point out that we likely left guest demand on the table last year as we were under inventory due to supply chain issues, and we continue to leverage our core assortment, which comprises approximately 45% of our inventory. Looking forward, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect the inventory growth rate at the end of Q3 to be slightly higher than the levels we saw at the end of Q2 before the growth rate moderates to 50% to 60% at the end of Q4. Our expectation of Q3 ending inventory now being the high-water line, when looked at on a 1-year basis, is being driven by better on-time performance at our vendors, which is allowing us to receive products sooner than we initially expected. This is also allowing us to use less airfreight as we now expect airfreight for the full year 2022 to be 10 basis points under last year versus our prior expectation of 30 basis points above last year. On a 3-year CAGR basis, we expect unit growth to remain consistent with Q2 levels in Q3 and moderate somewhat in Q4. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 420,000 shares at an average price of $298. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $830 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program. I'm excited with our continued strong performance despite the challenges presented by the current macro environment. Our teams across the business are executing at a high level. However, as we did throughout the pandemic, we continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios, so we are ready should we see any change in guest behavior. We have multiple levers to pull when it comes to discretionary expenses and capital expenditures. And as Calvin said, we are monitoring our guest metrics very closely to determine if we need to make any adjustments. Let me shift now to our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2022. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.81 billion, representing 1 year growth of 23% to 24% and a 3-year CAGR of approximately 25. We expect to open 25 net new company-operated stores in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to be down 50 to 70 basis points relative to Q3 of 2021. While we expect to see leverage on airfreight expense relative to last year, this will be offset by the timing of expenses related to our supply chain initiatives as well as a more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year. In Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to be relatively flat with Q3 2021. Based on the timing of our investments, we would expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q4 as well. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 versus adjusted EPS of $1.62 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $7.87 billion to $7.94 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the low- to mid-20s relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of approximately 26%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19% leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new Power of Three x2 growth plan. We now expect to open approximately 75 net new company-operated stores in 2022, up modestly from our prior guidance of approximately 70. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 45 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 100 to 130 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven predominantly by increased investment in our DC network, and a more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year while still below 2019 levels. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We are now forecasting leverage of 100 to 130 basis points versus 2021, driven predominantly by increased sales. And when looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2022, we expect it to be approximately flat to up slightly versus last year. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.75 to $9.90 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on the real estate sale we realized in Q2. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $610 million to $635 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Notably, this includes our new multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth and increased square footage growth relative to last year. A range of $610 million to $635 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. As you can see from our results, lululemon continues to perform at a high level, and I am consistently impressed by the ability of our teams to anticipate, meet and exceed the needs of our guests. And across the business, we're seeing that our guests are eager to welcome us into new categories, styles and markets, which speaks to the significant growth potential for lululemon going forward. We are off to a very good start as we embark upon our Power of Three x2 growth plan, and there's a clarity and focus on the work underway across the company. And in closing, I want to express my gratitude to everyone at lululemon for your hard work and the passion that continues to show all of us the power of our people and company. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations, another just remarkable quarter. Calvin, I guess I wanted to talk about there was a lot of intra-quarter chatter about kind of promotions across the space and kind of a slowing in the athleisure. We've obviously talked about how lulu is more of a brand rather than sort of a retailer. But I really want to understand what are -- what is the method that you're using to address some of the promotions that are going on around you? You no longer do warehouse sales. You're just doing sort of the online clearance, but you're not even calling that out as an online warehouse sale. So just what are the methods that you're using to move through the aged inventory that's allowing you to keep up the brand equities? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. In terms of methods, there's been no change to our approach on markdowns. As you know, we were -- we took modest price increases on a small percentage of our range of product. We continue to closely monitor that. And our markdown activity is in line with past penetrations 2019 pre-pandemic. And it really is -- our momentum is driven through the pillars of growth and innovation of our product. So the positioning around unique innovative products through our core is resonating with our guests and our markdown behavior has not changed with no plans to change and the quarter's results were driven by full price selling prices. Operator : The next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : So really encouraging to hear you haven't seen any major shifts in consumer behavior. Given the choppier macro backdrop versus a few months ago that many others have called out, maybe just speak a little bit more to what you're seeing in your business that's giving you the confidence to actually raise the implied back half growth outlook? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. One of the areas that continue to fuel our momentum and give us the confidence and the momentum heading into the back half of this year is the balanced growth that we're seeing across all of our pillars in the Power of Three x2 growth initiatives. And I'll quickly break them down because it really does support that narrative and the fact that we're in early innings of growth, and we have multiple levers to pull to grow our business that we are innovating into through our strategies, and they are resonating. So from a product perspective, when you look at our business across activities, categories and gender, where our men's business was up 27%, our women's business was up 24%, accessories was up 80%. We were seeing very balanced growth in all of those activities driving and through innovation. On the guest side, the omni guest key initiatives, our new guests were up 24% existing. We're transacting at a 17% increase rate. Traffic was incredibly strong with stores up 30%, e-com up 40 and strong sales comps across both our e-com in-store business, again, very balanced. And then at the regional level, North America, up 28%; international up 35%. So the plan that we've been working on is we are early innings of the execution, but it's resonating, it's working and the business is growing across all of these levers in a very balanced way that's allowing us to achieve the results, contributing the momentum. In the back half, when I look at product innovation and innovation across the guest with the launch of our membership program and our expansion into the regions gives us the confidence that we can keep the momentum in our business strong and hence, the guidance that we've shared. Mark Altschwager : Great. And congrats to you and the team on the strong results. Operator : The next question is from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Great. And congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to dig into the international result, amazing at 35% year-over-year. Can you just talk about the key drivers there? If there were specific geographies or more broad-based? And also, as it becomes a bigger part of lululemon's revenue over time, can you just talk about what the margin implications would be? Calvin McDonald : Well, absolutely. Very pleased with our international business. As you know, our 5-year plan is to quadruple it. And across every market we're in, we continue to see very strong results for the brand, the way it's resonating in the market. And excited about the investment strategies we have in a rolling out across -- in Europe. We're seeing good growth across all countries. We opened our dot-com site in Spain. We actually opened our first store in Barcelona tomorrow. We opened Madrid in a few weeks. We're opening in Champs-Elysees later this year. So excited about the opportunities we continue to see in Europe. Across Asia Pacific, in Australia with some of the new stores that we've opened. And China, which continues to be one of our big market opportunities even with ongoing operational challenges, we saw an acceleration in the quarter, with China growing 30%. And excited about the way the new stores are working in the market, the way that product continues to resonate, new guest acquisition and activating through communities. So in every market where we're in, we're seeing a very balanced contribution to our growth and are early in the opportunities that we see in each of these markets. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on a really nice quarter. So Calvin, on the high 20s revenue CAGR that you posted in the first half and taking into account the new customer acquisition metrics that you cited, so do you think the performance that you're seeing relative to the remainder of the market, is this a combination of a larger TAM, but then also company-specific market share gains? And then Meghan, I guess more near term, have you seen any notable change in momentum in either stores or digital so far in August? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matthew. I'll take the first half. We've definitely seen market share gain according to NPD. We've -- we are the largest share gainer in the quarter at 1.4 points. So we're very pleased with our performance, our performance relative to our peer sets. And I think the first half of this year is really a consistent narrative of new category expansion, driving awareness through a number of earned media opportunities as well as us continuing our investment in collective and community and reactivating some events, great product that's driving new guest acquisition and an existing guest that continues to be engaged in the expansion of both our core and play activities, be it golf, tennis, hike, those are resonating very well. They're lifting our core sales. So it's a combination of the levers that we've been working towards, and it has translated into market share gain in the quarter. Meghan Frank : And Matt, I'd add on Q3 -- so we're happy with the start of the quarter. I'm comfortable with the guidance we provided, which was a 3-year revenue CAGR of 25%. And as Calvin mentioned, we are seeing continued strength in our guest behavior and metrics there, which we continue to monitor closely. And I'd say within that, pleased with the performance of stores and digital that you asked about. And obviously, the macro environment is dynamic. We continue to plan the business based on multiple scenarios and feel well positioned as we enter Q3. Matthew Boss : Congrats again. Best of luck. Operator : The next question is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I was wondering if you could reflect on the very strong new customer acquisition trends that you've been seeing in this quarter. Can you speak to more detail on what specifically is driving that new guest acquisition? Are the demographics of that customer changing versus your historical new guests? And how important are these new product categories or select accessory items in driving that engagement? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. As you've indicated, very healthy new guest acquisition numbers at plus 24%. And I would say the majority of their first purchases have been very consistent with our traditional categories that we're seeing, very strong bottoms business and very strong in women's and new guest in men. So very pleased with the balance. The success of the everywhere belt bag has added to new guest acquisition. So we're excited to see that as a way to bring even more into our collective and with our guests. But the bulk and the majority of the driver as it is with our sales growth is our core traditional. When we expand into new categories and as we expand deeper into play, it really resonates with our existing guests, which is a big part of the positioning of the strategy, and we saw that through existing guests increasing transactions with us at plus 17%, very healthy. So the strategy is, obviously, bring them in, new guests, migrate them up and expand and increase the share of wallet. And innovation is doing both in pulling new guests in as well as migrating them up in their spend. And we're seeing a very healthy balance across all of those levers. Operator : The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : Can you talk a little bit about the reaction to the limited price increases you've taken so far this year? And then any expectations for the back half or into '23 to continue along the path of price increases? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, as we mentioned, we've taken modest increases -- or we were taking throughout the year of modest increases on approximately 10% of the assortment. We haven't, to date, experienced any price resistance. We continue to closely monitor and don't have any plans to change our markdown cadence as we move throughout the year, still very high, healthy full price sell-throughs. Operator : The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the impressive results. As you see -- as you take a look at freight, it seems like it's moderated from the first quarter to the second quarter. How do you see freight going through the balance of the year? And then just next thing on -- Calvin, the core product, obviously, is 45% of sales. The new collections that are coming in are certainly driving conversion and interest. How do you see core as a percent of the business going forward given the solid receptivity to new categories? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Dana. So in terms of airfreight, yes, we've started to see it moderate. As I mentioned, we are starting to see higher on-time deliveries from our vendors as well as some shorter lead times. So we have amended the color that we provided on airfreight to be 10 basis points under last year for the full year. And then that compares to 30 basis points above that we previously guided to. We still see airfreight as an opportunity over the longer term. It still sits 280 basis points above 2019. But we'll continue to see that moderate through the second half of the year, and the team is looking for opportunities wherever possible to be as efficient as fees well there. Calvin McDonald : And Dana, on the question around core, we have not seen a material shift in that nor does the strategy and the success of the strategy to suggest we should. If anything, as we continue to create depth and strength in our core, it could increase as a percentage of our overall business. And as I shared, we have opportunity within some of our core own activities such as run, train and yoga to keep developing core items. And the play activities that we launched across golf, tennis and hike are designed to and absolutely achieved in the results, the goal of using unique innovation to bring in awareness, interest, credibility into these activities, but to ultimately still drive core as much of our core and the versatility of the product can be used in those sweat activities. And the strategy has worked in the first half of the year as we continue to innovate and lean in. So very niche and small number of SKUs, leveraging core, which holds at 45%. And as we expand opportunities in some of the core activities, I expect that number to hold, if not improve. Operator : The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen & Company. John Kernan : Congrats on phenomenal results. Maybe if you go back to international, it's obviously a huge portion of your future growth when you quadruple that. Just curious what is enabling you to outperform all of your peers in China to such an extent in the most recent quarter? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, John. I think it's no different than the ability of us to put on market share and outperform the market -- in our most mature market being North America, where we are still early and have the opportunity to grow. We are early in brand awareness. The product led by innovation is resonating. Our investment in our guest relationships, I shared a little bit about the sweat games and the number of guests that participate in that both physical as well as digitally, over 100,000 online with us. And the investment [indiscernible] exciting to keep seeing the success, share the tier cities. We're in now in Tier 1 and Tier 2 and Tier 3, all resonating, responding well. So our D2C model is unique versus our peers and other brands in that market. It's rooted in relationships, building the community, which has how we built our business and great innovative product that is differentiated and unique in the marketplace. So it is our formula. It is resonating in that, and we have an incredible team led by [ San Yan ] leading it and across the stores and a very strong culture. So we're excited, but it really is the lululemon formula that's resonating and delivering the results. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Congrats on a great quarter. Meghan, on the gross margin, we're just trying to do a little bit of the math you gave us here in the second half. It looks like the overall gross margin range you're giving us for the back half is pretty close to what it was before. But I think you have about 60 basis points less airfreight pressure on a 1-year basis in the back half. Any callouts as to the offset there just so we can kind of track along with you on the build there? And then in the back half on airfreight pressure, how locked in are you in the guidance that you gave versus -- fixed versus variable that could change here given how much spot rates have been moving around lately? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Michael. So we guided to 10 basis points under last year in airfreight versus the 30 basis points higher than we experienced that we had shared on the last call. So we are starting to see both the impact of the early deliveries as well as the rates coming down, and the team continues to look for opportunities there. We will continue as the business expands to look at pulling forward investments that are part of our road map as we move to our next 5-year trajectory. So we have improved our margin guide for the year from 100 to 150 basis points down year-over-year to 100 to 130. So continue to feel like we're moving in the right direction, and airfreight represents a big opportunity for us over the longer term, still 280 basis points above 2019 levels. Operator : The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I guess, first on the SG&A. I think, Meghan, originally, you expected SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. I heard you say flattish now. I'm just wondering if you're pulling forward or accelerating any investments? And then kind of a conjunct to that. I know at the Analyst Day, you had talked about a coordinated marketing campaign this fall. Is that still on tap? And can you give us kind of an idea of what we'll see when that launches? Meghan Frank : Yes. So in terms of SG&A, we haven't previously provided Q4 guidance. We've got some timing, I would say, on investments. And again, as we look at our full year outlook, looking to pull forward some investments that are part of our road map as we look towards our next 5-year trajectory. So we are guiding now to 100 to 130 basis points of leverage for the full year versus our prior guide at 50 to 100. We -- yes. And then Calvin is going to chime in here on the marketing. Calvin McDonald : Yes. On the marketing, there's a couple of exciting initiatives planned in the back half. One is around our launch of our 2-tier membership program shortly. And that is more of a North American focus, but we're excited to bring that to our guests. And Nikki was referencing, as we continue to look at ways of just bringing a coordinated global message, our approach to holiday this year in some key categories. There's not a material change in spend, but we continue to find effective ways to deliver a strong, powerful product, community-led message around the globe. We're making gains on that. Helped in the first half, and we'll continue to do so in the second half and moving forward. Operator : The next question is from Tom Nikic with Wedbush. Tom Nikic : Meghan, I want to ask about the inventory growth. I know that there's kind of a lot of puts and takes here. And one of the things is increased transit times and things like that. When we kind of look at inventory, I guess, beyond the end of this year, like I mean, do you think that just structurally, you're going to carry more inventory on the balance sheet relative to the sales level? Or do you think when we kind of get beyond this year and things kind of normalize a little bit, maybe going forward, you would grow inventory at a slower rate relative to sales and you would see turnover improve? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Tom. Yes. So inventory this year, when you look at it on a 1-year basis includes higher usage of airfreight impacting our AUC as well as comparisons to out of stocks last year. And then as I mentioned, we're starting to experience earlier deliveries, both vendor readiness and then also lead times. So there is quite a bit of a dynamic nature when specifically looking on a 1-year basis, which is why we've been really focused on that 3-year unit CAGR. I do see opportunity over the longer term for us to manage inventory below at some point, our sales trend -- as some of these trends normalize. And then over the longer term, we aim to manage our inventory in line with sales. Operator : The next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. I want to -- Meghan, I want to follow up on the last point. Just talking about receiving inventory sooner. Can you give us an idea of how long it's taking now to receive goods and sort of how long it was taking it to peak? And what would be normal going forward? What would be a normal amount of time to receive the goods? Meghan Frank : Yes. There's a couple of dynamics going on. One would be we are seeing vendor readiness metrics improve. So that's one impact. And then the other impact, I would say, is ocean lead times. So we typically have seen, and this is on average about 45 days. These have gone up to 90 days plus during the kind of peak disruption. We've seen them drop approximately to 70 days. So not back to where they were, but definitely improvement to what we've seen. So that, coupled with the earlier vendor readiness provides some opportunities for us to switch modes, which you see reflected in our guidance. Jay Sole : Got it. And if I can just maybe, Calvin, asked you one question about accessories. You mentioned the belt bag, and just the success overall of the company adding new categories. Can you just talk about accessories, what's the opportunity to continue to segment that category to offer price points in bags maybe above $200 versus kind of what you're offering now, which is sort of like lower price relative to a lot of the competition that's out there selling tool bags and backpacks and things like that? Calvin McDonald : Yes. No. We're excited about the opportunity in our accessories business and definitely have plans across a number of the categories. Everywhere belt bag is a lower price point item. We're seeing it being a great driver across existing guests as well as guest acquisition. I think accessories, in general, has played a role like that and could continue to play a stronger role. The team has done a wonderful job in the last few years, bringing great innovation into the sock business, and we have a very strong growing innovative product line in the sock category. Bags, being one of the biggest opportunities, we are dropping and innovating incrementally in the pipeline for the foreseeable future is to continue to develop out that category where we all agree we can do even more and have a great opportunity across. As you said, backpacks, we have a lot of on-the-move bags for sport, but also a variety of unmet needs that the teams are innovating into. So bags is definitely on our road map of product pipeline, building on the everywhere belt bag, but accessories in general is a great opportunity to keep growing, contributing and guest acquisition. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Just looking at the reported sales numbers and comps, I think you got a spread of about 600 basis points, but your square footage is up around 19%. So just wanted to understand what accounts for the difference there, why there isn't a bigger between comps and total sales growth and maybe tie in how you're feeling about the new store performance as you're opening in some of these international markets. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Paul. Yes, I'd say there's a nuance there and looking at it from an omni perspective with our -- the size of our e-commerce business. That said, what I'd share is we're really pleased with the productivity of both our existing store base. We've gotten above 2019 levels. We continue to see opportunity for further expansion over the longer term. I'm really pleased with our new store expansion strategy. We did raise our guidance from 70 new stores to 75 for the full year with some exciting opportunity in front of us, both in our North America and international regions. So stores, I would say, remain a very important and productive part of our business model, including the operating margin, which we've seen get into the high 20s in the quarter. Operator : That's all that we have -- that's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website, www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our third quarter results, which, as you've seen from our press release, continue to be strong and resilient while we navigate an external environment that remains challenging. At Lululemon, innovation is at our core. We create apparel, footwear and gear that offers technical solutions to our guests as well as versatility and comfort with a variety of end uses, but that's just the starting point for us. Lululemon is a brand that stands for community with connection firmly at our core. We connect with guests through our educators and ambassadors through our well-being offerings and local events and now through our new membership program in Lululemon Studio. It is this combination of innovation and connection that differentiates Lululemon from our peers and contribute meaningfully to the continued and sustained momentum we see across the business. Over the next few minutes, I'll highlight for you the trends we've experienced over the recent Thanksgiving weekend on what we're seeing in our business at the start of the holiday season. Then I'll discuss quarter 3 and speak to the balanced strength we continue to see across our business in terms of geography, channel and merchandise categories. Next, I'll update you on the supply chain environment and our inventories, and then I'll speak to our product pipeline. And finally, I'll speak to the benefits of our direct-to-consumer model and several of the unique ways we enabled connection with our community. So let's jump in. I will start with our performance over Thanksgiving as I'm sure it's top of mind for all of you. I'm pleased with our results and performance over the extended Thanksgiving weekend and as we start the holiday season. Over the past 2 weeks, I have traveled with several senior leaders across North America to cities, including Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando, New York and Toronto. We visited several stores in each market and saw a tremendous level of engagement from our team members, our guests in every store. In fact, Black Friday was the biggest day ever in our history in terms of revenue and traffic driven by our results in both North America and around the world, with guests responding well to the innovation we offer across our product assortment. Our performance across markets and geographies shows that consumers are seeking brands like Lululemon that offer innovative, versatile product and a strong community connection that they can't find anywhere else. We also recognize that the external environment remains challenging with several high-volume weeks still in front of us. That being said, I'm encouraged with the beginning of our holiday season and I am confident in how our brand is positioned in the near and long term. Now I will speak to our performance in quarter 3. Meghan will go through the details in a few moments, but I'll share with you some of the financial highlights. Our revenue growth remains strong and balanced across several drivers as follows : all on a 3-year CAGR basis. Stores increased 16%, while e-commerce grew 46%, by region, North America grew 24% and international increased 42%. Revenue in Mainland China grew nearly 70% and we experienced strength across merchandise categories with men's up 28%, women's up 23% and accessories growing at 52%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% versus last year and 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis. And our market share gains continue. While the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue by 4% in fiscal quarter 3 '22 compared to the same period last year, Lululemon gained 1.5 points of market share in the U.S. over this time, the most of any brand in this market according to the NPD Group's consumer tracking service. These results are only possible due to the strength and dedication of our people around the world. To our teams in our stores, in our distribution centers and call centers and in our store support centers, I'd like to express my gratitude on behalf of the entire leadership team. You connect with our guests every day, execute against our growth plan and continue to support one another, all of which enable the financial results we deliver quarter after quarter. Turning now to supply chain and our inventories. We continue to see improvements across our supply chain. Our factories have now returned to pre-pandemic levels of production efficiency. In addition, ocean delivery times are continuing to improve from the 70 days we experienced last quarter. I'm also excited to share that we recently opened our Tilbury distribution center located near Vancouver to support demand in Western Canada. This DC is a great example of our ongoing investment in strategic foundational infrastructure projects that will help fuel our \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan. In terms of inventory, we ended quarter 3 with dollar inventory up 85% on a 1-year basis and units up 38% on a 3-year CAGR basis, both metrics in line with our expectations. As we discussed, our inventory levels were too lean last year, and we made the strategic decision to build inventories this year, which enabled the strong top line growth we have delivered. Meghan will share additional details, and we remain comfortable with both the quality and quantity of our inventory. We continue to leverage our core styles, which account for approximately 45% of our total inventory and carry limited seasonal markdown risk. I'd also note that quarter 3 will represent the high point for our inventory on a 1-year dollar basis. And as we enter quarter 4, we are well positioned to be in stock throughout the holiday season. I will now spend a few minutes speaking about product. As you know, innovation at Lululemon is fueled by our science of field development platform. Our team's focus first on identifying the unmet needs of our guests and then we view them through the lens of activities to develop new franchises and other hero items that are versatile and innovative. Quarter 3 had some great examples of how we bring this strategy to life. In footwear, we launched our fourth style, Strongfeel. Like the other technical styles rolled out this year, Strongfeel was designed for women first, which differentiates us from many of our peers who create shoes for men and then adapt them for women. Strongfeel is a technical training shoe designed to keep the foot anchored and secured during workouts and we're encouraged by the initial guest response. As I've mentioned before, footwear is a test-and-learn category for us, and it represents a small portion of the growth we anticipate over the next 5 years. This allows us to build into the potential at an appropriate pace as we learn and make adjustments. That being said, we're excited about the potential opportunity in this category, and we were pleased to be recognized by Footwear News with the Launch of the Year Award presented during their 36th Annual Achievement Awards last week in New York. Turning now to franchises. It's great to see how our teams continue to build out our range of Wunder Puff offerings. We started with a single women's jacket and have expanded into 11 styles within this outerwear franchise across women's, men's and accessories. Our results show that our guests respond extremely well to the breadth of options. While last year, we were constrained in terms of inventory, particularly in outerwear, we are well positioned with Wunder Puffs for the holiday season and expect to meet guest demand. As we look forward, franchise development represents a unique and distinctive opportunity for Lululemon with Align, Scuba and Define as a few examples, all of them beginning with a singular style and then expanding into popular multiple style offerings. And this is just the beginning. We will continue to introduce, expand and grow our franchise business into the future. Let me now shift gears and speak to another one of Lululemon's key competitive advantages, our D2C model. Our ability to connect directly with guests in real time and across both our physical and digital channels gives us a number of ways to engage beyond a purchase transaction. In quarter 3, we launched our new membership program, began to hold local 10-K races for the first time since the pandemic began, and we brought focus to World Mental Health Day around the world with a notable activation in China. Some highlights are, in early October, we successfully launched our new 2-tier membership program in North America. The essential tier is free to everyone and offers unique benefits to members, including early access to product drops, exchange or credit on sale items and invitations to virtual community events. The premium tier of the program, Lululemon Studio represents the evolution of Mirror into a much more engaging hybrid fitness offering. We've extended our collective by partnering with some of the best fitness studios and instructors to bring even more classes to our members, both digitally and in real life. To join, members purchased a Lululemon Studio Mirror, agreed to a $39 monthly subscription and received many exciting new benefits. Another way we engage with guests is through our 10-K runs. We sponsored 2 races in Atlanta and in Houston and we're excited by the response. We paused these experiences during the pandemic. So I'm thrilled that we have been able to hold these large-scale community activations once again, bringing together our guests, local teams and ambassadors to extend our community connection. And in China, we brought attention to World Mental Health Day in October with a month-long campaign aimed at inspiring people to take positive actions towards improving their physical, mental and social well-being. This included in real life events focused on wellness, media partnerships and the launch of a digital well-being hub on WeChat. These examples bring to life the unique ways we connect with our guests and our communities across the globe. This enduring strength of Lululemon demonstrates our ability to be globally strong and regionally relevant as we foster a deeper relationship with Lululemon for existing and importantly, new guests. All of this increases brand awareness, drives traffic to our stores and websites and ultimately results in higher purchase consideration engagement with Lululemon. Before handing it over to Meghan, I wanted to speak further about our international business. As you know, our plans call for a quadrupling of international revenue over 5 years from 2021 to 2026, and I'm very pleased with how our leaders and local teams are executing against that goal. This was reinforced for me during my recent visits to the United Kingdom and Australia. I toured both markets with our local leaders and team members and got to experience firsthand the energy and excitement of our stores and our recently optimized locations in Australia. It's also exciting to see how we are elevating the guest experience in these markets with the recent rollout of ship from store and enhanced endless aisle capabilities in both regions. With strong leaders in each of these markets and across our international business, I'm energized by our ability to continue to strategically expand Lululemon across geographies. The potential is considerable. And building upon the momentum from our recent market entry into Spain, we opened another iconic location in Europe just last week with a store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. In the heart of one of the city's main shopping districts, this store will enable us to grow brand awareness, both in France and across Europe, given this is such a popular tourist destination. While our growth prospects are balanced across geographies, international represents a key piece of our \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan. We're off to a great start, and I look forward to sharing more with you on future earnings calls. With that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'm pleased that our momentum continued in Q3, and we were able to deliver both top and bottom line results, which exceeded our guidance. The holiday season is also off to a good start with strong traffic over the extended Thanksgiving weekend, and a positive guest response to our holiday merchandise assortment. In addition, we're in a much better inventory position this year to meet guest demand. However, I also want to acknowledge that we have several large volume weeks ahead of us, and our teams remain focused on connecting and engaging with our guests. Let me now share the details of our Q3 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q3 2022 with Q3 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q3 2021 exclude $0.18 of expense related to the acquisition of Mirror. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q3, total net revenue increased 28% to $1.86 billion, ahead of our guidance. Comparable sales increased 25% with a 17% increase in stores and a 34% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 27%. In our store channel, sales increased 28% on a 1-year basis and 16% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity continues to trend above 2019 levels. And although we had 22 stores closed in Mainland China in the last week of November, we currently have 99% of our fleet open globally. We ended the quarter with a total of 623 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 71 net new stores since Q3 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 23 net new stores and completed 7 co-located optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 46% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $767 million of top line or 41% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 24% and within international, we saw a 42% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 23% and accessories grew 52% on the same basis. I'm also excited that we continue to see strength in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased nearly 25%. And in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased nearly 50%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 9% in stores and over 41% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Gross profit for the third quarter was $1.04 billion or 55.9% of net revenue compared to 57.2% of net revenue in Q3 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 130 basis points relative to last year was driven primarily by 60 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange within gross margin, which was somewhat offset by a 20 basis point FX benefit within SG&A. A 40 basis point decrease in product margin, driven primarily by higher markdowns and inventory provisions relative to low levels last year, partially offset by lower air freight expense. And 30 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs, driven primarily by investments in our product teams and distribution centers, offset somewhat by leverage on occupancy and depreciation. When looking at markdowns versus 2019, they were relatively flat and in line with our expectations. The decline in gross margin was larger than our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, driven predominantly by FX and regional revenue mix. From a regional standpoint, while revenue growth in China was strong for the quarter, it was below our expectations due to COVID-19 impacts. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $684 million or 36.8% of net revenue compared to 37.6% of net revenue in Q3 2021. The leverage in the quarter versus Q3 2021 resulted from leverage in our stores and other channels on corporate SG&A and on foreign exchange. This was offset somewhat by an increase in depreciation and amortization. Operating income for the quarter was $352 million or 19% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.4% last year. Tax expense for the quarter was $97 million or 27.6% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of fiscal 2022's Canadian earnings and a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. Net income for the quarter was $255 million or $2 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.62 in Q3 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $176 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the third quarter last year. Q3 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $353 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q3 was $1.7 billion, in line with our expectations. This reflects 1-year dollar growth of 85% and a 3-year unit CAGR of 38%. In-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 3 percentage points to the 3-year unit growth rate. I'd also note that core seasonless product continues to make up approximately 45% of our inventory. We remain pleased with our inventory levels, which position us well to fulfill guest demand in Q4. Looking forward, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect the inventory growth rate at the end of Q4 to begin to moderate and increase approximately 60% relative to last year. On a 3-year CAGR basis, we expect unit growth to be approximately 39% at the end of Q4. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 55,000 shares at an average price of approximately $311. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $812 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program. Let me now shift to our guidance outlook. We're pleased with the start of the holiday season. However, the environment remains dynamic, and we still have approximately 2/3 of the quarter ahead of us. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $2.605 billion to $2.655 billion, representing 1 year growth of 22% to 25% and a 3-year CAGR of 23% to 24%. We expect to open approximately 30 net new company-operated stores in Q4. We expect gross margin in Q4 to increase 10 to 20 basis points relative to Q4 of 2021. We expect to see an improvement year-over-year in product margin, driven by lower airfreight expense, which will be partially offset by continued FX pressure and the timing of expenses related to our supply chain investments. We expect markdowns to be in line with 2019 levels. In Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage 30 to 50 basis points relative to Q4 2021. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 versus adjusted EPS of $3.37 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $7.944 billion to $7.994 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business continues to grow approximately 30% relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 26%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan. We now expect to open 79 net new company-operated stores in 2022, up modestly from our prior guidance of 75. Our new store openings in 2022 will include 45 to 50 stores in our international markets and represent a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total. For the full year, we forecast gross margin to decrease between 100 and 140 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven predominantly by foreign exchange. A more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year and increased investment in our DC network. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We forecast leverage of 100 to 140 basis points versus 2021 driven predominantly by increased sales. And when looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2022, we expect it to be approximately flat versus last year. For the full year 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q4, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.87 to $9.97 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on the real estate sale we realized in Q2. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $630 million to $655 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects, including our multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth. And we are also ramping up our square footage growth relative to last year and now intend to open 79 stores versus our prior expectation of 75. Our range of $630 million to $655 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current \"Power of Three x2\" [indiscernible]. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. In closing, I just want to reiterate how pleased we are to see the continued momentum in the business and our strong start to our \"Power of Three x2\" growth strategy. As we look to quarter 4 and into 2023, I am confident in both our near- and long-term plans that will enable us to deliver on our goals while continuing to successfully navigate whatever comes our way. I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: And may I say congratulations, very well done. Calvin, I wanted to focus a little bit on China. You talked about kind of strong growth there. You're opening lots of stores out there [indiscernible] probably for next year. What are you seeing then-- what is the breakdown between stores and e-commerce [indiscernible]. Calvin McDonald : Adrienne, thanks for the question. We're seeing very good growth across both store channel and our dot-com channel. We don't share the ratio between those 2 but both contributed to growth in the quarter. And as you indicated, the market continued to grow very strongly for us even with their ongoing challenges with COVID where we saw store closures, reduced operating hours comparable to what we saw in quarter 2. They're improving, but just recently, and the team is doing a wonderful job managing through that. But the momentum in the brand across the categories in both genders and both channels remains very strong. And we're very excited about the potential of the brand to be able to continue to drive it through this year as we have and how the guest is responding to it. So we remain very, very excited about the potential and the role that will play in quadrupling our international business with Mainland China playing a big part of that performance. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. Can you give the percent of sales [indiscernible]? Calvin McDonald : In terms of growth in the quarter? Or... No, no, sorry, we don't share that. Operator : The next question is from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Great. And of course, congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to just start with what you mentioned on the early holiday performance. It sounds like you guys have been delivering a really impressive result compared to what we've heard across other specialty retailers this earnings season and even at our conference earlier this week. So you guys are really kind of bucking the trend here. What would you attribute Lulu's quarter-to-date outperformance to so far? Calvin McDonald : Thanks for the question. I'll break it into 2 parts that are driving the momentum both in Q3 as well as to the start of Q4, where our guest metrics have been consistent, as I've shared and remain very healthy across traffic, new guest acquisition, dollar spend, and the balance across our regions, our channels, our categories and activities. But I think one of the primary drivers of our brand and momentum relative to others really sits with the brand positioning and the uniqueness of our brand with product focused on technical solutions, fabrics through our innovative approach of science of feel and the versatility of how the guest uses our product from not just sweating but through on the move. Our D2C model and community and that connection that we have with the guest in quarter 3, we were able to turn some of those physical connections back on and connected to the launch of membership. So they're really distinct aspects of the brand that separate us from many others in this space and within the athletic, within retail, hence, I think the share gains and the overall success. I also think some of the decisions we made as a management team early on. Decisions around pricing, decisions around [indiscernible] to have the products and our decision around inventory has allowed us to continue to deliver on the demand side that we're seeing as we continue to see new guest acquisition strong and the pricing decisions to really manage pricing, to not move pricing aggressively, has allowed us to continue to sell our regular price, not be forced into unnecessary markdowns or course correcting with promotional play like we're seeing happen in the marketplace. So great products, regular price is still selling, driven off of the uniqueness of the overall brand and position in the market. Alexandra Straton : That's super great color. Maybe one just final one for me. I wanted to touch on inventory. Similarly, juxtaposing you guys against some of the peers, we've seen many be able to work inventory levels down on a year-over-year basis. Can you just talk about why Lulu is more similar to the last quarter? And then also I think you may have taken the fourth quarter outlook up a little bit on inventory, maybe from 60% to 55% -- from 55% to 60%. So I think a little bit higher than last time. Correct me if I'm wrong, but can you guys just talk about that dynamic for us? Meghan Frank : Yes, absolutely. So end of Q4 inventory was in line with our expectations. We were under inventory last year. So as Calvin mentioned, we strategically positioned inventory to be able to capture guest demand this year. We've really been focused on that 3-year unit CAGR, which is 38% at the end of the quarter with 3 points driven by in transit. We are continuing to experience supply chain environment improving and vendor readiness improving. So the team is adjusting to that new reality. That is reflected in the 60% color that we gave for year-end. So as we said, a little bit higher than the 55% to 60%, we gave at the end of last quarter for end of year inventory driven by that improving supply chain environment and vendor readiness. Operator : The next question is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, the innovation pipeline at Lululemon has been particularly strong this year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that into next year? And where you think the product resonance can really improve as you think about managing consistent growth across your business and particularly in North America. Maybe within that, you could reflect on the glide path between the very strong 1- and 3-year CAGRs that you're performing now versus the longer-term target of 15% and how you think about that growth may be normalizing over the course of the next few years to that long-term target? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Brooke. So in terms of the product pipeline, this year was definitely an exciting year across both our own categories and activities, our play activities, launch of footwear, Q3, like the first half of this year saw a number of new innovations, both in new fabrics, fabrications into our proven franchises like the Align. And Q4, equally, we have some exciting innovation that has hit and will continue to, and the guest is responding very well. That's a proven formula for us. And when I look forward to 2023, we continue to and will continue to drop innovation across the core activities that we've identified of run, train, yoga of the play tennis, golf and hike, and it's both new franchise [indiscernible] items as well as extensions of some of our proven very successful franchises. A great example of that is the Align franchise, one of our strongest with the Lulu fabrication and there's Lulu Ribbed that dropped at the end of Q3, available now in Q4 and the guests are responding incredibly well to that. So we have a number of innovative opportunities across creating completely new items and category extensions through franchise as well as building on the ones. And '23 is another very strong year of innovative launches, which I'm excited about continuing to bring to market. And as you mentioned, we are after the first 3 quarters of this year, trending above the guidance of the \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan, which we're excited to see how the brand is responding and the guests are reacting to the newness in our new guest acquisition. We haven't changed our outlook and the commitment on the \"Power of Three x2\", but obviously, very pleased with our performance to date and as we look forward into next year. Brooke Roach : And if I could just squeeze one more in for Meghan. Meghan, can you help us with the approximate sizing of the airfreight FX and supply chain investment that is going into the gross margin in 4Q? And remind us how much of those pressures will be persisting into 2023? Meghan Frank : Yes. So as we look at Q4, we do expect that overall operating margin will have similar pressure as we did in Q3 in terms of FX. So we had a net pressure of 40 basis points in Q3. We're expecting something similar for Q4. When we look overall at our operating margin for Q4, we see it expanding year-over-year in the 40 to 70 basis point range with our guidance versus last year in gross margin, we gave color of 10 to 20 basis points. We're seeing a benefit on product margin driven by lower air freight, which will be partially offset by normalized markdowns in line with our 2019 levels and then also mix of business. We also had that negative impact from FX. And then we'll also have some pressure in gross margin related to fixed costs, particularly the timing of our DC investments, which are really positioned to enable our scale of the business over the next 5 years. And then on the SG&A side, we're expecting 30 to 50 basis points of leverage, which would be driven by higher sales as well as a little bit of a benefit on the FX side within SG&A. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Congrats on another nice quarter. So Calvin, on the material market share gains that you cited, where do you see the largest share opportunities remaining maybe across categories? And then just to elaborate on the start of the fourth quarter, could you just provide any color on the cadence of shopping that you're seeing, maybe stores versus digital? And then just given the comments on the encouraging start of 4Q, is it fair to say you've embedded moderation in the growth CAGR for the remaining 2/3 of the quarter relative to your start? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. So on the last piece in terms of the start of the quarter and what we're seeing, traffic was very strong for us across both our online channel as well as stores in Q3, and we're pleased with the continuation of strong traffic numbers into this quarter. And there's still a lot of the quarter ahead. So as we shared, we had a very strong Thanksgiving shopping weekend and saw good results of our regular priced merchandise and there are some critical weeks ahead. So the teams just remain focused in managing accordingly as we get ready for the holiday season. So that's our approach and how we're monitoring and managing through. And the first part of the question, right, market share. Got it. When I look forward in terms of our continual opportunity to grow market share, it's a combination of both in men's and women's categories and our key activities that we've identified across run, train, yoga, tennis, golf and hike. We shared at our Analyst Day our opportunity in unaided brand awareness with Him. We have seen an improvement in that, but it's well below what the potential is and other brands in our category space. So we know as we continue to drive awareness behind the brand in consideration, it's having an impact on our men's business, pleased with the growth in the quarter of 28% but really just getting started in terms of the potential of more being aware of and considering Lululemon in addition to, as we continue to build out some of the assortment and unmet needs that we have around those core activities that we focused on. And for Her, although we have a better unaided brand awareness, we are still below, again, others in our category space. So we still have opportunity. And women's OTM for us is an exciting opportunity to expand that relationship share of wallet and continue to drive market share. So market share gains, one through unaided awareness and improving that to continue to drive our new guest acquisition, innovating within our core activities as we've identified, as I mentioned before, we're still early innings on the unmet needs and the potential that we see to continue to bring to market and then the option and the opportunity we have around women's OTM is a really exciting one for us, for her as well. So a lot of opportunities that we have to continue to drive market share. Operator : The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : Just wanted to ask a few more follow-ups on gross margin. Do you still expect airfreight to be a 10 basis point benefit to the full year? And have you changed your view at all on markdowns for the fourth quarter given the more promotional environment? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, so we are expecting airfreight to be slightly better for the full year. So we had said 10 basis points last time, and it's come up to 50. That is being offset by a negative impact from FX both for Q3 and Q4. And then in terms of markdowns, we've been expecting markdowns to be in line with 2019 levels. We did see that in Q3, and that remains our expectation in Q4. And we view that as a more normalized level for us as we compare to 2019. And still, as Calvin mentioned, very healthy full price sell-throughs and no changes in plans for markdown. Operator : The next question is from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Rakesh Patel : Can you help us think about profitability by region? I'm just curious how that's tracking given your strong demand globally versus strategic investments that you're also making and where you see the most opportunity as you look out to the next year? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Rick. So we are profitable across both our international and North America regions. We were pleased that Europe hit profitability last year. We continue to see opportunity across both North America and international over the longer term. We're obviously in earlier stages in our international business. So we'd expect to see more expansion there as we scale, but the opportunities with scale across both regions. Operator : The next question is from Abbie Zvejnieks with Piper Sandler. Abigail Zvejnieks : I was wondering if you had any category commentary. I know that last year, you were significantly under inventory in some categories like outerwear, but any shifts you're seeing there? And then maybe commentary on Everywhere Belt Bag. Meghan Frank : Yes. I would say in terms of categories, we are seeing pretty balanced growth across our men's, women's and accessories business, all in the double-digit range. We did have pockets of inventory where we were under last year, notably, I call it outerwear where we've seen more positive performance and believe we're in a strong inventory position as we enter Q4. In terms of the Everywhere Belt Bag, it's been a great style for us. Accessories growth, obviously, very strong. It's our #1 sale and we continue to innovate across all of our assortments as we move into Q4 and then into 2023 as well. Operator : The next question is from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : Congrats on navigating a tricky environment. Thanks for all the commentary on gross margin and inventory. I guess when we look at the level of units but also the cost on the balance sheet, is there anything lingering in the cost of goods sold into next year from some of the higher sourcing costs earlier this year that might be a source of pressure on gross margin? Or do you -- are there offsets to that as we -- from supply chain as we go into next year? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, John. I would say we're pleased with the inventory level as we move into Q4, we're obviously seeing some improvement in the supply chain environment. In terms of airfreight, we have seen that moderate throughout the year. We do have a large portion of our inventory that is core, about 45%, so that benefits us. We're not putting a fine point on margin for next year but remain committed to modest operating margin expansion over the longer term. And we'll come back and share more details on our outlook on our March call. John Kernan : Got it. I guess just a quick follow-up. Would supply chain cost being more of a benefit this year -- or next year, excuse me, as some of the container costs come down, airfreight, obviously, already coming down [indiscernible]? Meghan Frank : Yes. So I -- there's 2 pieces of the supply chain cost. So one is usage and then one is CPU. We are seeing lead times improve. We had called out 70 days on average last quarter. We're seeing them improve modestly, I'd say they're still not back to historical levels there. But we are seeing some positive movement on the CPU front. So we continue to view that as an opportunity as we move into next year. Operator : The next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Great. I'm curious what the early takeaways have been from the broader rollout of the Like New initiative? What are you seeing in terms of guest spend for those who have turned in used product. And similarly, curious if you can share anything else regarding the Lululemon Studio launch and maybe shed some light on your expectations for the Studio Mirror revenue for this year and next. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks for the question. So with the Like New, it's currently live in 50 states in an approximately 390 stores and we're not sharing specific performance details, but where we are pleased with the results we're seeing is really a twofold : one, guest acquisition on the resale side, new to the brand and the opportunity to enter at a different price point. And then with our current guests, their spending based on trade-in, where they come in and get a variety of different trade-in values and gift cards, we are monitoring and seeing a positive response to that. So it's a new pilot rollout initiative for us, and we're pleased with the early results, and we'll continue to monitor. But early, it's been positive. And from -- sorry. On the Studio side, I'll break it down into 2. From the essential membership tier, which is our free membership program, if you remember on Analyst Day, we indicated that we aim to have 80% of our guests to sign up for the program. And based on our glide path to that as guests come into our channels, be it online or in store, we're running ahead of that. So we're very happy with the sign-ups at this point. And it's going to allow us to engage with that guest base through a variety of new benefits that we offer in a very exciting, positive way. And with the introduction, the re-branding of Mirror into Studio as well, very pleased with the response, continuing to test and learn but we're excited how the platform fits within community, fits within our essential membership program and allows us to continue to innovate behind community and the connection with our guests. So it's early, only a few months, but encouraged with the results we're seeing. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Congrats on a great quarter. Meghan, I guess just a housekeeping one. When do you think FX pressure to the gross margin can start to get better here given where rates are moving lately? And then I guess I'm just curious if you could help us unpack the gross margin a little bit more for next year. I know you answered it a little bit, but it seems like the industry is looking to get clean on inventory, so there should be some recapture opportunity there. Obviously, of freight, you spoke about a little bit and I'm curious how long you think that pressure on the fixed cost line within gross margin that flipped over to a negative this quarter on a nice comp. Does that roll forward with us for a few quarters? Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks. I would say in terms of FX, our outlook is that Q4 is more similar than not to Q3.  I think hard to put a fine point on next year, but I would view it as an opportunity over the longer-term time horizon. In terms of gross margin next year, again, do view airfreight as a benefit but we're also committed really to that bottom line operating income expansion on a modest basis. We'll continue to balance opportunities and investments in the business, really focused on driving into our long-term goals, both of revenue growth and being able to scale with the business and support that long-term opportunity that we see. And then I would say fixed costs, particularly on the DC side, we have some upfront investments in our DC capabilities and footprint in order to support that long-term volume. So we'll see some pressure in the near term and then see that start to leverage over time as we move through our 5-year plan. It is a multiyear road map. So we'll continue to offer some color there as we move through that. Michael Binetti : If I could sneak one in on the fourth quarter just -- I think you embedded in the comp for fourth quarter, particularly between the channel stores and e-comm, considering where traffic is, how much it's up based on some of the metrics you gave us and how busy your stores get over the next few weeks here. Maybe just a little bit on how you're thinking about the 2 channels. Meghan Frank : Yes, we didn't break down the channels for Q4. What we did offer was 23% to 24% sales growth overall. And we did give some color for the year on e-commerce at approximately 30% growth, which would embed both our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4. Operator : The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore Partners. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask my first question on pricing, actually. I know you guys have been -- haven't been too aggressive or haven't had really the need to use pricing lever even in this inflationary environment. But as you see COGS, inflation, freight, FX impacting the gross margin. Maybe talk about your appetite and the brand strength and the brand's capability to use pricing as a tool as needed? And then maybe also dive in deeper on China. It seems like the form they were pretty solid despite all the COVID closures going on there? Maybe talk about what the outlook will be once -- what your expectations are for that business once the -- who knows when it will be, but once the kind of market and economy and consumer spending and retail environment opens up there? Calvin McDonald : Omar, on pricing, as we've stated, we only increased around 10% of our assortment mix this year as we priced in and we continue to evaluate and look for opportunity. And we separate cost of goods and any pressure we're seeing there with short-term cost of supply chain logistics. And what we don't want to do is react too aggressively and create any impact on the demand of our product. And we're going to continue to take that approach, comfortable on the inflationary pressures we're seeing on cost of goods and how we're priced in. And as I said, we'll adjust on the other. And I think as we've seen through the 3 quarters of this year, the decision so far has been the right decision, where others that priced up are now heavily discounting and giving away any of that perceived gain and more so and having to mark goods down where we're able to continue to sell our product at regular price, not react and our markdown performance has been in our guidance in line with what we indicated we would be from a 2019 perspective. So I -- we continue to monitor it, but our pricing decisions, I think, have helped to fuel our momentum this year, and we'll continue to take a similar approach as we look out to next year. And on China, we remain very excited. Our new store openings, we opened 9 stores in the quarter in Mainland China. We have 88 now in market. Their performance continues to exceed -- beat expectations. In markets where we don't have constraints related to COVID, the store performance and online performance is very strong. So we remain very excited about the market, committed to the market and know that it will play a strong role in our growth of quadrupling international through our \"Power of Three x2\" growth strategy. Omar Saad : Just to clarify, in terms of pricing, so it's not that you don't think the Lululemon brand has the pricing power, but you just don't see the need given some of the transitional nature of some of the inflation going on there to chase pricing given the environment. Is that a fair characterization? Calvin McDonald : It's a fair characteristic, but I'd also indicate when we mentioned the 10% of assortment that we've moved pricing on, throughout this year, we've looked at our new innovation and priced it accordingly relative to where we see opportunity in the marketplace. So we absolutely know that this is a premium brand. We have pricing power. We're able to launch and introduce exciting new innovation that is priced to support the technology and the innovation that is into the product. And we are being cautious in managing our regular pricing accordingly with the promotional nature of the market so that we're able to continue to sort of drive the demand at regular price that we're seeing, and we'll manage accordingly. But absolutely, it's not a reflection of what we believe the pricing power of the brand is. In fact, I think the way the brand is performing in a heavily promoted environment actually supports the power of the pricing position that we have at Lululemon. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : The next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : Great. Calvin, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you've seen from the footwear business when you think about the Strongfeel versus Blissfeel versus Chargefeel? Have you seen the consumer adopt one style versus the other? I mean, have you seen certain colors or SKUs do better? And are you looking to expand the assortment as you get into next year? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Jay. We're pleased with the results to date. As you indicated, we have 4 SKUs within our footwear and each have performed well. It's a combination. We're seeing certain guests purchase multiple styles, and we're seeing new guests enter either into Blissfeel or Chargefeel or into Strongfeel or Restfeel. Restfeel being our first dual-gender offering for both Him and Her and the other 3 being specific for our female guest built off of a last design on Her foot. As we look forward, I'm excited about continuing to test and learn as we indicated, it doesn't play a big role in our \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan that we shared on Analyst Day, and it's an exciting category for us. And we have the ability and we'll take the ability to pace, to learn but we started with a very innovative, unique positioning, and we'll build from that. And colors -- from the color [indiscernible] responding very well to the colors. I think that's one of the unique positionings of it is our core colors of black and white are strong, but a lot of the unique color waves, She's responded very well to. So it's early for us, excited about the results, and we'll continue to test and learn and share more. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's fourth quarter earnings conference call.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our strong finish to another strong year for lululemon. As you've seen from our press release, our adjusted quarter 4 results came in ahead of our January guidance update, and our adjusted full year results represent a very solid start to our Power of Three x2 growth plan. I'm also excited that we continue to see strength and momentum across the business so far in quarter 1. None of this would have been possible without our lululemon collective, our employees, our vendor partners, our ambassadors and our guests, all of whom are integral to our continued success. I want to express my gratitude on behalf of all of the senior leaders to our incredible teams around the world. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to lululemon. We are ready for all the future holds for our brand in 2023 and beyond.  On today's call, I plan to cover several topics : our quarter 4 and full year results; our product pipeline for 2023; an update our membership program; our recent market share gains; and finally, insights across our international business. So let's get started. Our momentum continued in quarter 4, with revenue increasing 30% versus last year and 26% on a 3-year CAGR basis. We managed the business very well through an environment that was highly promotional, and our markdowns were only up a modest 40 basis points versus 2019. I am pleased that as we progressed out of the holidays and began to transition to new spring merchandise, regular price sales returned to our normal levels. This speaks to the power of our brand, the appeal of our merchandise assortment and the strength of our operating model. And as you can see from our guidance, business remains good in quarter 1, and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2023. Our business continues to be well balanced across product category, channel and region. Revenue increased in quarter 4 on a 3-year CAGR basis as follows. Women's was up 23%. Our men's business was up 26%, and accessories was up 44%. We saw a 10% increase in company-operated stores and our e-commerce grew 46%. And by region, North America grew 24%, and international increased 39%. When looking at adjusted earnings per share, we continue to deliver strong gains as well, with quarter 4 EPS increasing 31% versus last year and 25% on a 3-year CAGR basis.  I would also like to spend a moment on our full year 2022 results. As you know, we launched our new 5-year Power of Three x2 growth plan last spring. At the highest level, this plan assumes 15% CAGR revenue growth and modest operating margin expansion annually. In 2022, our revenue increased 30% compared to 2021 and 27% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points, while adjusted EPS increased 29% and 27% on a 1- and 3-year CAGR basis, respectively. It is a testament to the strength of our brand that for the full year 2022, we were able to significantly exceed our annual revenue goal and deliver adjusted operating margin in line with our target. And we achieved these results despite the challenging macro backdrop, supply chain issues and the pressure of COVID-19 in China.  Now let's shift to product innovation. 2022 was a strong year for product newness and innovation. We continue to expand our core categories with the launch of SenseKnit fabric technology and cold weather run styles. We grew our play categories with our golf, tennis and hike capsules, and we entered a new category with the launch of footwear. Looking forward into 2023, I continue to be incredibly excited by the pipeline of innovation developed by our product teams. Several of our ideas this year include franchise growth, category expansions and building upon the success of some recently launched collections. First, in the coming weeks, we will launch our Get Into It campaign featuring our popular and versatile Align franchise. As you know, Align began with a single style, a legging, which we grew to be our #1 performing bottom. We then expanded the collection to include shorts, tanks and bras. More recently, we added away from body styles, including wide leg and mini flare. We will support this product story with an integrated global marketing campaign. We will also be expanding our Men's franchise, License to Train, into women's later this year, which will complement our accessible Wunder Train franchise. In men's, we continue to innovate within our core activities with new versions of the Metal Vent tee and the Pace Breaker short. Updates to fit, function and aesthetic have modernized these guest favorites. And in footwear, we recently introduced an updated version of Blissfeel, which incorporates learnings from the initial launch, and it's already receiving the same kind of positive media reviews that we have seen throughout our footwear rollout. In May, we will launch Blissfeel Trail, our first road-to-trail shoe, and this summer, we'll introduce an updated version of Chargefeel. Related to footwear, we are pleased with our performance and guest response. Looking forward, we're excited to continue expanding our offerings for her and also launch our men's lineup in 2024.  These are just a few examples of how we solve for the unmet needs of our guests. The versatility of our merchandise assortment is one of the key competitive advantages for lululemon. One thing to add is that we do not drive our top line growth through discounts or promotions, and we have no intentions to do so. We run a full-price business with markdowns strategically used to clear seasonal and other select product, and this will remain our approach in the future.  Now I would like to update you on membership. We launched our new 2-tier membership program in North America this past October, and throughout the holiday season, we gained many learnings and insights regarding how our guests engage with our brand.  Let me start with our Essentials program, which is offered to guess at no cost. While we do not intend to release this metric regularly. I wanted to share that the number of sign-ups is significantly exceeding our expectations. In the first 5 months, we have already enrolled more than 9 million members. This demonstrates the significant potential behind this program. While the Essentials tier offers several compelling benefits and access to content, no discounts are involved. The rapid rate of sign-up speaks to the incredible loyalty of our guests, and the early results show our membership program increases the frequency of guests engaging with us. For example, more than 30% of members have already participated in at least one of the benefits of the program, and we expect this engagement to drive retention and incremental purchasing behavior going forward.  Related to the lululemon Studio tier of our membership program, we have also gained valuable insights that are informing our next steps. As we mentioned in our press release, we are taking an impairment charge related to assets and goodwill associated with MIRROR. Meghan will share more details with you in a moment.  As you know, we tested a paid city-based membership program in North America prior to our acquisition of MIRROR. Through that experience, we saw how guests were eager to engage with us through some of the sweat options we provided to participants. Not only did members enjoy these benefits, but we also saw increased member engagement, new guest acquisition and an increase in member spend. These learnings were the basis for our acquisition in 2020.  The recent launch of lululemon Studio has provided a new way to scale a paid membership program. Our best-in-class content helps build on our community of engaged guests, deepens our connection with them and drives incremental purchases of lululemon product. In fact, after studying the behavior of members, our initial analysis suggests that their spend on lululemon product increases approximately 9%, and this 9% is incremental. However, as you know, since our acquisition, the at-home fitness space has been challenging. While members love our content, hardware sales did not match our expectations, and even though our CAC has continued to improve, it has not improved enough to maintain the current level of investment.  As we continue to invest prudently in this business, we are evolving the model from being focused on hardware only to offering content through a digital and app-based solution as well. The new more efficient app-based model will launch this summer at a lower monthly subscription rate and when combined with our 9 million and growing Essentials members will allow us to expand our total addressable market for potential members. We view lululemon Studio in the same way we view any innovation. We test. We learn, and we evolve as necessary. Although the acquisition has not fully materialized as originally intended, we're in a much better position in our understanding of the community and our new membership program as a result.  Shifting gears, I want to speak to the strength of the lululemon brand and the gains we are seeing in market share. Let me share a few metrics with you. When looking at transactions, our growth continues to be well balanced across new and existing guests. In quarter 4, we delivered a nearly 30% increase in transactions by new guests and more than 35% increase in transactions by existing guests. For the full year, these results contributed to a mid- to high 20% increase for both metrics.  Next, I will touch on our recent and continued gain in market share. In fiscal quarter 4, 2022, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue by 5% compared to the same period last year. And over this time period, lululemon gained 2.3 points of market share in the U.S., the most of any brand in this market according to NPD Group's consumer tracking service. This is the highest quarterly market share gain we've achieved since we began tracking these numbers in 2020, and it caps a year in which we grew our market share every quarter. This speaks to our growth in the U.S., a key market within North America. And as we detailed at Analyst Day, we have significant opportunity to grow our brand awareness in North America and markets around the world.  Just since last April, we have seen increases in awareness in some of our key growth regions. We added 5 points to our unaided awareness in Australia from 19% to 24%, 2 points in China from 7% to 9% and 2 points in the U.K., taking us to 16% in the market. As you can see from these numbers, significantly more consumers in these regions are currently unaware of our brand compared to those who are, which highlights this meaningful opportunity.  As I mentioned earlier, our business remained strong in both our North America and international markets. In quarter 4 and full year 2022, revenue in North America increased 29%, while our international business generated 35% growth in quarter 4 and for the full year as well.  I would like to turn to our results in China where our potential continues to be significant. We have been investing in foundational infrastructure, people in stores that have fueled considerable growth in the market. As the impacts of COVID-19 normalize, we are seeing our momentum accelerate, and we are excited for the opportunities in the region in 2023 and beyond.  In quarter 4, revenue in China increased more than 30% versus last year and over 50% on a 3-year CAGR basis. While COVID-19 impacted revenue in December, we had a strong finish to the quarter and have seen momentum accelerate in quarter 1. We have a solid foundation in the region across our brick-and-mortar and digital channels and is supported by exceptional talent on which we continue to build. We recently opened our largest store in Asia Pacific, Kerry Center in Shanghai. It's an incredible expression of our brand, reflecting our commitment to the market, and it now brings our store count in China to nearly 100 locations. It's clear our growth strategies are on track, and we remain early in our journey across our international markets. With that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'm excited to be here today to discuss our Q4 results. We finished 2022 on a strong note with our adjusted results exceeding the updated guidance we provided in mid-January. This was enabled by an acceleration in our sales trend, along with the normalization of purchasing behavior relative to full price and markdown product. Looking at Q1, our business continues to be robust. Our inventory growth will continue to moderate, and we expect to realize significant gross margin expansion driven by lower air freight.  Let me now share the details of our Q4 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q4 2022 with Q4 2021, adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2022 exclude $3.46 of expense related to impairment charges associated with the MIRROR business. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2021 exclude $0.01 of expense related to the acquisition of MIRROR. I will provide more detail on the Q4 2022 impairment charge shortly. And you can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-K for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.  For Q4, total net revenue rose 30% to $2.8 billion. Comparable sales increased 30% with a 17% increase in stores and a 39% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 26%. In our store channel, sales increased 26% on a 1-year basis and 10% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity remains above 2019 levels. We ended the quarter with a total of 655 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 21% versus last year, driven by the addition of 81 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 32 net new stores and completed 13 optimizations.  In our digital channel, revenues increased 46% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $1.4 billion of top line or 52% of total revenue. Within North America, revenues increased 29% versus last year and 24% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Within international, we saw a 35% increase versus last year and 39% on a 3-year CAGR basis.  And by category, men's revenue increased 22% versus last year and 26% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Women's increased 30% versus last year and 23% on a 3-year CAGR basis. And accessories grew 69% and 44% on the same basis.  It's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased over 30%; and in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased over 45%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 7% in stores and 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni-operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.  Adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.59 billion or 57.4% of net revenue compared to 58.1% of net revenue in Q4 2021. Adjusted gross margin decreased 70 basis points relative to last year. This was driven primarily by the following factors : 50 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange within gross margin, which was offset by a 50 basis point FX benefit within SG&A and 50 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs. This was driven primarily by investments in our product teams and DC, offset somewhat by leverage on occupancy and depreciation. These were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in product margin. This increase was driven primarily by lower air freight expense, partially offset by higher markdowns and merchandise mix.  When looking at markdowns relative to 2019, for Q4, they were up 40 basis points, contributing to markdowns being relatively flat for the full year versus 2019. Adjusted gross margin was favorable to our updated guidance, which was a decline of 90 to 110 basis points due predominantly to favorability and markdowns in air freight in addition to leverage from higher-than-planned sales.  Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $803 million or 29% of net revenue compared to 30.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. The leverage in the quarter versus Q4 2021 resulted from leverage in our operating channels and a benefit from FX I mentioned earlier. This was offset somewhat by increased corporate SG&A and a modest increase in depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted operating income for the quarter was approximately $785 million or 28.3% of net revenue compared to 27.8% of net revenue in Q4 2021. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $226.5 million or 28.7% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.4% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to accruing for Canadian withholding taxes on a portion of fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings and some benefit we had last year upon the filing of income tax returns. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $562.5 million or $4.40 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.37 for the fourth quarter of 2021.  Capital expenditures were approximately $207 million for the quarter compared to approximately $128 million in Q4 of last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Before turning to our balance sheet highlights, let me spend a moment on the charges we took related to the MIRROR business. As you know, the overall at-home fitness space remains challenged. MIRROR hardware sales during the holiday season came in below our expectations, therefore, we ran an impairment test at the end of Q4. Based upon this test, we took charges related to the impairment of goodwill and certain long-lived assets and a provision for MIRROR hardware. These charges totaled approximately $443 million, net of tax, or $3.46 per share. The valuations used in the impairment calculation are based on an evaluation of MIRROR on a stand-alone basis.  We are pivoting away from the hardware-centric business that we acquired to also focus on a more efficient app-based model. While we see Studio as a key component of our membership strategy, which will help drive incremental revenue, the stand-alone valuation of MIRROR doesn't fully reflect the incremental revenue. Looking forward, we remain excited about our membership program. As Calvin shared, we already have over 9 million members in our Essentials program, and we continue to see opportunity to build our community, increase engagement and drive incremental spend. Turning now to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.4 billion, modestly under our expectations for 60% growth. This reflects 1 year dollar growth of 50% or 57%, excluding the provision for MIRROR hardware.  I would also like to note that core seasonless product continues to make up approximately 45% of our inventory. We remain pleased with our inventory levels. In 2023, our inventory growth will continue to moderate, while we maintain our full price selling model, and we remain well positioned to fulfill guest demand. At the end of Q1, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect inventory to increase approximately 30% to 35% relative to last year. Looking further out, we expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth in the second half of 2023.  During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 213,000 shares at an average price of $323. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $744 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.  Let me shift now to our guidance outlook. While we are mindful of the ongoing macro uncertainties and we continue to plan the business prudently, we're excited with our sales trends in Q1 and also the benefits we expect to realize in 2023 from lower air freight and our new lululemon Studio model. We have the opportunity to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin in 2023, slightly ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually.  In 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.41 billion. This range represents growth of 15% to 16% relative to 2022 and is in line to slightly better than our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open 45 to 50 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2023 will include 30 to 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these planned for China.  For the full year, we forecast gross margin to increase between 140 to 160 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year was driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we expect air freight to be down approximately 150 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we expect them to be in line with last year in 2019.  Let me also share some additional detail on our multiyear distribution center project. We began this project in 2022 with the opening of our new Tilbury DC near Vancouver. For the year overall, this project had a negative 30 basis point impact on gross margin. In 2023, we will continue investing in our distribution network to support future growth. Projects include building a new DC in the Greater Los Angeles area and also expanding 2 of our existing DCs in Columbus and Toronto. Included in our gross margin guidance for the year is 20 basis points of deleverage associated with these initiatives.  Turning now to SG&A for the full year. We forecast deleverage of 120 to 140 basis points versus 2022, driven predominantly by increased investments to support market expansion, improve our guest experience by enhancing our omni capabilities and continuing to make foundational investments to support future growth. In addition, we expect higher depreciation due to current and prior year investments.  When looking at operating margin for the full year 2023, we expect it to increase by 20 to 40 basis points versus last year. This would be slightly ahead of our Power of Three x2 long-term target of a modest expansion annually.  For the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2022 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1%. This is in line with our longer-term tax rate expectations we provided as part of our Power of Three x2 plan and reflects the increase we expect as a result of accruing for Canadian withholding taxes. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%.  For the fiscal year 2023, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.50 to $11.72 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $660 million to $680 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center expansion, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, and technology investments. Our range of $660 million to $680 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.  Shifting now to Q1. We expect revenue in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.93 billion, representing 1 year growth of 17% to 20%. We expect to open 5 to 10 net new company-operated stores in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to increase 290 to 320 basis points relative to Q1 of 2022. This will be driven by lower air freight expense offset somewhat by strategic investments in supply chain and distribution centers as well as foreign exchange. In Q1, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 60 to 80 basis points relative to Q1 2022, related to the investments I just described.  When looking at operating margin for Q1, we expect expansion of approximately 200 basis points. We expect earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $1.93 to $2 versus adjusted EPS of $1.48 a year ago. With that, I will wrap up my remarks and turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. In 2022, we passed $8 billion in revenue for the first time driven by balanced growth across categories, channels and markets. Our product pipeline driven by innovation is very strong. More than 9 million guests signed up for our Essentials membership program in the first 5 months, which further strengthens the opportunity to keep building our community, strengthen our guest relationship and drive long-term value. Our market share gains show our brand is able to expand and attract new guests, and yet our unaided awareness remains low, which demonstrates the runway in front of us. And we're seeing strong momentum in every market where we operate, and we continue to successfully expand into new geographies. These are just some of the reasons I'm excited about all that's in front of us, both in 2023 and over the coming years.  I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations, everybody, for stellar year and great momentum coming into the first quarter. Calvin, I was wondering if you can help expand upon that notion of unaided brand awareness. I think that's a really powerful concept there. What was your advertising spend as a percent of sales last year? And what avenues are you going to be using sort of to expand that brand awareness.  And then Meghan, really quickly, if you can just expand upon the notion of flat promos, I think you said to last year and 2019, just trying to understand those 2 comparisons. And that is a nice improvement, I think, from kind of ICR when maybe, I think, we were in a little bit more of a promotional kind of backdrop or notion of promotions coming into the year. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. In terms of unaided brand awareness, as you highlighted, it's exciting to see both our improvements in it, but also the runway of growth and potential we have. So we know that our approach is working as well as we know that it's going to continue to fuel our ability to acquire guests and drive the overall momentum in the business across all markets, including North America and the U.S.  Our current spend is in around the 4% range. And at this point, we're planning to maintain the percentage of sales relatively consistent. How we deploy it? It's a combination of opening stores, which is a wonderful vehicle to drive that awareness and acquire guests, connecting with guests and ambassadors in our local communities and investing in both our community activations as well as these relationships; expanding our relationships with lead athletes around the world, which we continue to make great contributions and add into our collective; and then finally, like you will see with the Get Into It campaign, executing more deliberate and coordinated global brand campaigns, which I'm excited for you to see that. Those are just some of the examples the way in which we activate our brand and product first through most of the messaging and that we've seen our success and excited for what we have planned in '23. Meghan Frank : In terms of markdowns, our full year 2022 markdowns came in, in line with 2019. And we're expecting to be relatively flat in 2023 on a full year basis. We do have the biggest opportunity in Q4, which will be offset somewhat by Q1 through Q3 markdowns. But that 2019 waterline, we view, is a healthy level for us. And then we'll also see inventory, as we mentioned, 30% to 35% growth at the end of Q1 and then coming in line with sales in the second half of 2023. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to focus on China for a minute. It was about 8% of sales last year. How are you thinking about the growth cadence there? And can you give an update for us on profitability of the region? Meghan Frank : Lorraine, in terms of China, we haven't put a fine point on China in 2023. However, what I'd say is we still had a degree of COVID disruption in both Q4 and full year '22, when we were at a 30% growth rate. We have seen that trend accelerate as we moved out of Q4 and into 2023, particularly Q1. So we are above that 30% growth. And then in terms of profitability, we are profitable in China. We haven't put a fine point on it beyond that. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Great quarter. Congratulations. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So I just want to -- my question -- I just want to focus on inventories because I know that has been a big topic for lululemon as well as the sector. So you had fantastic results here in the fourth quarter. I'm looking at the math you. You ended the year, inventory is up, I guess, just around 50%. So as we think about '23, within the context of the guidance you gave, how should we expect that inventory to moderate? And is it -- are you essentially saying you're just going to work through that primarily for the normal course of business without really any excess promotions? Meghan Frank : Yes. So in terms of inventory, we've been navigating obviously the dynamic supply chain environment. And we did place a number of core buys earlier to try to manage our air freight expense. We do have a higher proportion of our inventory in core, 45% versus 40% historically. We also saw increased air freight impacting our cost inventory balances. And then we also saw vendors who were shipping later than historically pivot to shipping more on time. So the team is still navigating and adjusting to that new reality.  And I would say, at the end of Q1, we're going to see inventory moderate to 30% to 35% growth, and we expect it to come in line towards the second half of the year. Our goal overall is to manage our inventory in line with our revenue growth and believe we'll be there over time. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can I just piggyback on the inventory question? Curious if you're a little bit heavier in certain geographies versus others and if it's going to take a little bit more time to clear and get to where you want to be in certain geographies. And then just separately, curious what you're looking at from a product cost perspective this year, first half versus second half, if you can share what you're anticipating on the AUC side. Meghan Frank : Yes. I would say nothing notable by geography in terms of inventory balances. We're pleased overall with the content composition, and we plan to, as we mentioned, have a healthy full price penetration as we move throughout the year. In terms of product costs, we haven't experienced any significant increases, and we don't expect any significant changes as we move throughout 2023, relatively stable. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Congrats, everyone. Two-part question. Maybe first for Calvin just on the MIRROR hardware decision. Can you walk us through a little bit more about what you saw in the holiday, and I guess, the past several quarters that kind of informed your decision that you guys ultimately made to eliminate the hardware piece of the business? And then, Meghan, is there anything you can quantify in the P&L? What kind of revenue or operating losses are being removed by eliminating that piece of the business this year? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Ike. On MIRROR, I just want to clarify, we're not eliminating the hardware, but we are adding a app feature that will allow a guest to sign up and pay a lower monthly subscription fee and acts as the same content without having to purchase the hardware. So I just want to clarify that. And that will launch later this summer. And we think with the lower cost to entry, not being hardware restricted and the 9 million Essential members that we've built and will continue to build, it will allow us to more easily migrate and attract guests into it. We did see an improvement in our performance with the launch of lululemon Studio in October. But as we shared, it just didn't meet our expectations. And although CACs are improving, they're still not proving fast enough that we didn't -- that we felt it prudent to make this pivot to open up the TAM and appeal to a broader audience within our collective. Meghan Frank : In terms of the P&L, we don't break out MIRROR separately given it's now embedded in our membership program. But what I will share is that it's a very small portion of our revenue this year and was also a very small portion of our 5-year plan. We have moderated investment levels, and we'll continue to do so and continue to see dilution improving. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Congrats on another good quarter. Two quick ones from me. The first is just on the big increase you mentioned in new guests. I think a 30% level or so. Could you share any learnings you have on how those new guests compare to existing guests? And then secondly, on the 40% to 45% of the business that's core, any insight you can give us on the split of the rest of the business, I guess, the newer categories and what they represent and whether they have similar full price sell-through rates to that legacy business? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. In terms of the new guests, we have -- one of the benefits of the brand is we see good success across guests across all age demographics. So that remains very healthy, both acquisition as well as engagement. We have seen a very healthy growth in our younger guest base, in particular, over the past 12 and 18 months, and that continued. But overall, we would wait a little bit on the younger but very healthy overall and seeing, as I indicated, very healthy numbers in terms of engagement of existing guests, the new guests, how those cohorts are shopping and engaging on a frequent basis and migrating up through the category offering that we have. Meghan Frank : And I'd share in terms of category breakdown of the balance of inventory outside of the 40% to 45% core, we're pleased with the seasonal nature of our product and the aging of that inventory. And in terms of by category, it'd be positioned relative to our Power of Three x2 plan in terms of category growth. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel from Raymond James. Rakesh Patel : Congrats on all the progress. I was hoping you could talk about your expectations for growth in North America for the new year. You've made a lot of progress already in the market. So I'm curious what you see as the strongest growth levers as we think about channels and product segments. Meghan Frank : So in terms of North America, we're looking at achieving our low double-digit expectation that we shared as part of our Power of Three x2. And sorry, can you remind me the second half of your question? Rakesh Patel : Yes. Just what the strongest growth levers are as we think about channels and product segments. Meghan Frank : Yes. I would say I'd frame that also in that context. So we have our 15% average growth rate annually as part of that plan, with a goal of the 4x international business, double our men's business, double our e-commerce business, and that also included low double-digit North America growth as well as low double-digit women's and store growth. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the results. As you think about the product margin puts and takes for 2023, how do you think about them and the markdowns which are normalized with 2019 levels, how do you see that evolving as we go through the year? Is there any cadence or shape that we should be mindful of? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Dana. So we're -- we shared color of 140 to 160 basis point increase in gross margin for the full year, and that would really be driven by a benefit from air freight down 150 basis points. We are expecting markdowns to be flat year-over-year, also flat to 2019 levels. And we have a little bit of pressure, as we mentioned, in our distribution center strategy that's really aimed at servicing our demand over time. In terms of cadence by quarter, I had mentioned earlier, we have the biggest opportunity in markdowns in Q4 offset by Q1 through Q3. And then in terms of air freight, our biggest opportunity will be Q1 in the range of 300 to 400 basis points. We will be higher -- we will have opportunity relative to the last year in Q2 and Q3, and then we're expecting, at this point in time, we'll be in line in Q4. Dana Telsey : Got it. And then just, Calvin, on the new product rollouts that are coming this year, where do you see the most opportunity to have an influence on the overall category given that you're gaining share in a category that's a little more challenged now? Calvin McDonald : In terms of the product, what I'm anticipating is similar to what we've been seeing, which is balanced growth across men's and women's, across categories and activities. The innovation, a little bit of what I've shared is a balance of continuing to innovate on our core styles and franchises like the recent update to the men's Metal Vent and Pace Breaker short as well as adding additional styles to proven franchises like the Align campaign that I'm really energized and excited about. It's a fantastic expression of one of our powerhouses and excited to use it as a way to continue to recruit new guests and then building on new launches like footwear and then bringing successes in our men's business with the License to Train into our women's assortment.  So I think it's another expression of the evolution we've had with our product strategy, which is early still, very balanced across the activities we identified expressed through categories and franchises across both men's and women's. So my anticipation is still very balanced growth both in North America, around the globe for product for us in '23 and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I was wondering if you could contemplate the customer engagement that you're seeing with full price relative to discounted product and how that engagement may have changed over the course of the last few months, combined with your expectation for that for the rest of the year. Does that engagement rate differ by region, age or customer income demographic? Meghan Frank : Brooke, in terms of markdown and full price penetration, we did see that normalize as we moved through the balance of January and then into Q1. We haven't seen any material differences by customer segment, and we do expect that we'll maintain that relationship of healthy full price in line with history that's reflected in the color we provided on markdowns being flat year-over-year, also flat to 2019, which we view as a healthy waterline for us. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : I'll add my congrats on a nice quarter and a nice update since ICR, Meghan. I guess on China, you built a lot of stores there since pre-COVID, and I think you've done -- I think you've -- you haven't had much time over there over the past 3 years, those stores operating in any kind of normal capacity. So if China was 8% of sales but it's 15% of your global store count, I'm just curious, if China was operating at normal productivity, would revenues be closer to that 15% store mix. Or do you think those stores -- any reason to think they should trend above or below global averages on sales per store or sales per flow? Just anything -- any way for us to think about the opportunity there with the assets you already have? And then Calvin, on thoughts on pricing in 2023, I know this hasn't been the most urgent lever for you to pull in recent quarters. You talked about that. Any change to that for 2023? Meghan Frank : Yes. In terms of China stores, definitely, we were impacted by COVID as we move throughout 2023. So I would expect that percentage to be higher. I would say our stores are highly productive there. They tend to be smaller than the balance of our fleet, particularly in North America, and we view that as an opportunity over time. We continue to have a long pipeline of store openings there. We also are very early in terms of store expansion strategy, which we've employed in North America to capitalize on where we see very strong and healthy sales per square foot and opportunities to expand the market. Calvin McDonald : And Michael, on pricing, I'll start with what we shared last year, which is going to be similar to our approach this year. And I'll start with I'm proud of the approach that the team took, and that is knowing we're a full price business. We only increased prices on a small percentage of our assortment so that we continue to lean in on full pricing and not rely on and have to pull the promo lever.  What we saw in the industry was many other players price up and then heavily discount that back down. But it allowed us to manage margins, manage full price selling throughout with selective pricing. And heading into '23, it's a similar approach. We're not planning any drastic significant moves in pricing and continue to focus on full price with markdowns as a means to exiting seasonal product only. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore. Omar Saad : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Calvin, maybe you could touch on the strategy to use paid media and how that's going for you guys. The efficacy, is that something you're using in other markets like China as well? And maybe a quick update on some of the new categories, footwear, hike, golf, et cetera, would be helpful. Calvin McDonald : Right. Thanks, Omar. In terms of our approach to media, we'll always and continue to use a balance between paid and earned. And I think we've really made gains in the last few years in leveraging both of those with earned media playing very, very heavily for us, which is great on the back of innovation, and some compelling story. So we're going to continue to leverage both of those, leaning in when we do, do paid into digital in more direct and specific. And I think you'll see a lot of that expressed and executed through the Get Into It Align campaign.  And Nikki and the team are also doing a wonderful job working with the regions in getting expression right through to the digital campaign, through to stores and in and around in local markets and amplifying that. So it just really fits and feels like a very omni expression, execution for the guests out of the store, in-store and across digital applications. So excited for you to see for that campaign expressed.  And your second part of the question was? Omar Saad : Just an update on some of the new categories, footwear, hike, golf. Calvin McDonald : Perfect. On the play activities, and I'll start there, they've -- the guests have responded very well to them. And I'm excited, as I've shared with you, in particular, on tennis and golf, how they're designed. We know that, that is how our guests also sweat and offering product and offering for them helps us strengthen the relationship and extend our share of wallet with them. And on those two, they're really designed to selectively innovate into and then leverage our core assortment. And in both of those executions last year when we really kicked off and then through the year and then into spring when we've recently brought tennis back as well as about to do so in golf, we're seeing that strategy execute very well where we sell a lot more core wrapped around a golf or tennis execution. We're going to continue to do that. So it allows us to manage assortment and SKU additions, while at the same point, drive productivity and credibility into these activities. And on footwear, it's a test-and-learn category for us. We've just cycled over the first year. Very pleased with early guest response. Very pleased with industry recognition to disrupt and innovate and create something new within footwear for women. We've just updated with our Blissfeel 2.0, and both the industry is very positive on it as well as our guest, and excited about continuing to sort of test and learn. And as I indicated, we'll be launching a Blissfeel Trail later, an update to our Chargefeel, and then next year in '24, the introduction of our men's footwear business. So we're excited with the response and continue to test and learn and innovate into the category. Operator : Last question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. Jay Sole : Just curious about the sales cadence for the year. Q1 looks like it's around high teens. And then it seems like the guidance implies the growth rate goes into the mid-teens range by the end of the year. Just wondering if there's like a specific driver that's part of that forecast or was just assume that you go back into the long-term algo? And then at the same time, just curious about accessories. You mentioned it's up 44% in Q4. Within that, I assume belt bags is a big driver. Calvin, I'm just worried about how you feel belt bags fits into the overall brand strategy and what you plan to do with that category going forward. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Jay. So in terms of cadence throughout the year, we are really pleased with our trends headed into Q1. And we're also mindful of the macroeconomic uncertainty. So our guidance reflects what we feel to be the appropriate direction at this time. The 16% to -- 15% to 16%, sorry, growth rate for the full year is slightly above our Power of Three x2 average of 15%. So we feel well positioned headed into the year. Calvin McDonald : And on accessories and the Everywhere Belt Bag, our accessories business is very healthy, and it's very balanced as well. It's not a one-hit wonder. That team has done a great job in building a compelling total bag business, not just that one particular item. We're pleased with that one item. Love the results. It's been a great driver of brand awareness as well as new guest acquisition. But we have an accessories business across all categories, not just bags, that continue to contribute and grow, and we're excited about its opportunity moving forward in our mix of the assortment for our guests. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.  Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our Investors site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to our call today. I'm happy to be here to discuss quarter 1 and share with you our strong start to 2023, which shows the continued momentum in the business. As you've read in our press release, we delivered top and bottom line results that exceeded our guidance. We continue to engage with guests across the globe and drive our business with new and innovative technical products.  On today's call, I'll provide updates on our quarter 1 performance, our community-based model, which is powered by our new membership program. I'll also share highlights on our product performance as well as our international business. And then I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and a guidance update. Then we'll take your questions. So lots to share. Let's get started. In quarter 1, as I mentioned, the business delivered strength across both the top and bottom line. Revenue increased 24% versus last year, balanced across category, channel and region. Women's was up 22%, men's was up 17%, and accessories was up 67%. Comparable sales grew 16% in stores and 18% in our e-commerce business. And by region, North America grew 17% and international increased 60%. Within international, we saw a meaningful acceleration in the Greater China business with revenue increasing 79%. EPS was strong as well, increasing 54% versus last year to $2.28. This strength was driven by revenue, gross margin and SG&A, all coming in better than our guidance. So a great start to the year, fueled by our product and people.  For today, I'd like to devote some time to talk about our community-based model. Not only does our approach allow us to connect uniquely and authentically with our guests, it also drives incrementality of spend and increases LTV as guests engage more with our brand. We are celebrating our 25th anniversary this year, and community has been at the core of our brand since day 1.  Within North America, 8 months ago, we embarked on an expansion of our model with our Essentials membership program. Through this free-to-join program, we gained deeper knowledge on how our guests like to sweat and what aspects of our brand are most meaningful to them. We can leverage the data and insights to help develop future activations, invite them to the events that are most relevant to them and inform our product pipeline with opportunities around unmet needs. Our stores are an integral part of this ecosystem as they provide connection points within local communities across the world and serve many purposes, including allowing our guests to interact with our educators to learn about our product, the technical innovations that can be found within our assortment and the unmet needs they solve.  Secondly, our stores act as hubs for our local ambassadors and fitness studios. Guests looking for new ways to sweat in their neighborhood need only enter the local lululemon store where our educators will point them to the best studios in town.  Thirdly, our stores are the focal point for local events that range from hosting run clubs and other sweat sessions to parties and community celebrations.  And finally, our stores provide support for some of our larger-scale activations, such as our 10K runs, product launches, including footwear and our lululemon Studio launch last fall. In quarter 1, we saw a meaningful increase in the number of community events compared to the same period last year, and this brings us back to the prepandemic levels. Key celebrations in the quarter included our Align Campus Haul Pass event to increase awareness of our new Align styles with our younger guests. And exclusively for Essential members, we ran 6 events across 3 cities, in Houston, Chicago and Boston, which were a great success and hugely oversubscribed.  Most recently, May has been a big month for activations. We went live with our new lululemon Studio digital app earlier this week. The app, which will help us broaden our TAM, offers guests in the U.S. access to our industry-leading content for only $12.99 per month without needing to purchase hardware.  We announced our FURTHER initiative. Further will demonstrate how far women can go when they're supported with resources and product innovations typically reserved for men. This initiative will include a scientific research program which takes a holistic approach to addressing the existing sex and gender data gap in endurance performance, new women's first product innovations, community activations and a giveback component to support young women. In addition, the program will culminate in a multiday women's-only ultramarathon starting on the International Women's Day 2024. At its core, this initiative supports lululemon's commitment to innovation, solving for unmet needs and driving brand awareness.  In addition, we tapped into dupe culture with our Align Legging Dupe Swap event in L.A. Our team set up a 2-day pop-up at the Century City Mall and asked guests to trade in their dupe leggings for a pair of our iconic Align Leggings. For us, the primary purpose of this event was new guest acquisition and increasing brand awareness for being the original in leggings. Overall, it was a resounding success. It generated more than 1 billion earned media impressions and was covered by national and international media outlets in addition to creating viral social media buzz. About 50% of the guests who traded in dupes are new to our brand. Approximately half of the guests who attended, some of whom started waiting in lines as early as 3 a.m., were under 30 years old. And while I won't get into specifics, the leggings that guests traded in ran the gamut in terms of brands and price points. We view our community model as one of our biggest competitive advantages. With connection points across both the physical and digital, our ecosystem powered by membership supports our leadership position in developing and cultivating omni guest relationships. We engage with guests in ways that are more than just transactional by creating deeper connections and more holistic relationships. This in turn builds our brand awareness, drives purchases and contributes to our strong financial performance.  Let's shift now to our product innovation. Guests responded well to our spring merchandise assortment as we continue to bring compelling innovation across our core and play activities in footwear. In women's, we saw continued strength in many of our key franchises, including Scuba, Define and Align.  When looking specifically at women's bottoms, we saw growth of 22%. While women's bottoms is our most mature category, our teams continue to update and enhance existing styles, bring innovation via new fabric technologies and create new styles and silhouettes that solve for unmet needs. In quarter 1, our strength in women's bottoms was driven by our iconic Dance Studio pants, which has always been a guest favorite and is currently experiencing a resurgence in popularity; the newest additions to our Align franchise, including the Mini Flare and Wide Leg; and our incredibly soft and smooth Softstreme bottoms. In men's, guests continue to respond well to our iconic ABC, Commission and Pace Breaker franchises. In accessories, I'm thrilled with the strength we continue to see across our assortment. While it is the smallest of our 3 major merchandise categories, it is a growing piece of our business that we fuel with innovation, just as we do across women's and men's. In quarter 1, guests responded well to our collection of bags, backpacks and duffles.  And we continue to bring newness and innovation into our footwear assortment. In quarter 1, we launched an updated and enhanced version of the Blissfeel running shoe. And just last week, we launched the Blissfeel Trail. This shoe was our first road-to-trail running shoe designed to offer traction and durability for guests who love to run on the trails and off the road.  Our Be Planet initiatives are also driving product innovation in support of our 2030 goal to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials and end-of-use solutions. For Earth Day in April, we debuted our first capsule collection made with plant-based nylon in collaboration with Geno, a leader in the sustainable material space. More recently, we announced a new partnership with Australian and viral tech start-up, Samsara Eco, to scale circularity through textile-to-textile recycling, which is a very cool technology. Together with Samsara, we're working towards recycling our apparel back into new products, bringing us one step closer to our end-to-end vision of circularity. This partnership, along with our other Be Planet initiatives, including Like New and our collaboration with Geno, is the latest example of how we are taking a leadership position in our sector and driving toward a circular ecosystem by 2030.  Turning now to our product pipeline. Let's take a look at quarter 2. We're continuing to build out our golf and tennis collections with versatile styles that can be worn both on and off the course and court. The second installment of our Get Into It campaign launched 2 weeks ago and featured both technical shorts and new on-the-move styles for both him and her. And for men, we'll be expanding our offering of train tops with new styles using our Drysense fabric technology. These are just a few examples of how we continue to bring innovation into all areas of our assortment, solve for the unmet needs of our guests, increase wallet share and grow our brand awareness.  Before I turn it over to Meghan to discuss our financials, I'll take a moment to share some geographical highlights with you. As you know, 1 of the 3 key pillars of our Power of Three x2 plan is international. We have a target to quadruple our business outside North America between 2021 and 2026. This will be driven predominantly by our existing markets, but we'll be entering some exciting new markets as well.  In 2022, international represented only 16% of our revenue, and I remain optimistic about our runway of global growth. As I stated earlier, our business remained strong in North America and across our international regions. In quarter 1, revenue in North America increased 17%, while we saw a 60% growth in international. In Greater China, we experienced a significant sequential acceleration in the business relative to quarter 4 as the effects of COVID-19 subsided. In total, revenue in Greater China increased 79% in quarter 1, ahead of our expectations and just one more sign of the potential within this market.  I had a chance to visit Shanghai in mid-April for the first time in 3 years, and it was great to see how much our brand has grown in the city. We walked through the neighborhoods we serve, visited our new stores, and I was impressed by the incredible brand experiences we are bringing to the local community. In addition, spending time with our educators as they engage with guests and bring our culture to life is always one of my favorite parts of being in market.  In EMEA, we're off to a great start in Spain, a market that we entered last fall. And with the help of a franchise partner, we recently opened our first store in Tel Aviv with Israel becoming the 24th market globally for lululemon. We know that the Israeli guest has been engaging with our brand while traveling to other regions, and now we'll be able to bring our product innovation and community and guest experiences directly to them in their home market.  In APAC, business remains robust as well. And in the coming months, I'm pleased that we will enter Thailand with our first store in Bangkok. Our approach to increasing brand awareness and growing revenue internationally is rooted in the same tenets as what has fueled our success in North America. This includes our multichannel direct-to-consumer model, our community-based approach to brand building, our innovative product assortment and the deep and direct connections we have with our guests. I'm excited for what the future holds for our global business as we continue to execute the Power of Three x2 growth plan.  And with that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our recent financial performance and provide you with our outlook for Q2 and our updated guidance for the year.  In Q1, sales, gross margin, SG&A, EPS and inventory all came in better than our guidance. Guests responded well to our spring merchandise assortment, we saw sales trends accelerate in Greater China, and we connected with our guests via multiple activations throughout the quarter. 2023 is off to a strong start, and based on our guidance, we continue to see solid momentum in Q2. Let me now share the details of our Q1 performance. Total net revenue rose 24% to $2 billion driven by continued strong execution across all parts of the business. Comparable sales increased 17%. In our store channel, comparable store sales increased 16%. We ended the quarter with a total of 662 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 22% versus last year driven by the addition of 83 net new lululemon stores since Q1 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 7 net new stores and completed 3 optimizations.  In our digital channel, comps increased 18% and contributed $835 million of top line or nearly 42% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 17% versus last year. And within international, we saw a 60% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 79%. And by category, women's revenue increased 22% versus last year, men's increased 17%, and accessories grew 67%.  It's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In both stores and digital channels, traffic increased approximately 30%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.  Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.15 billion or 57.5% of net revenue compared to 53.9% of net revenue in Q1 2022. The gross profit rate in Q1 increased 360 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 430 basis point increase in product margin, resulting predominantly from lower airfreight as well as regional mix. Markdowns were in line with last year. Occupancy and depreciation leveraged 10 basis points in the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in product and supply chain costs driven by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain. In addition, FX deleveraged by 50 basis points, which was predominantly offset by a 40 basis point FX benefit within SG&A. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $748 million or 37.4% of net revenue compared to 37.7% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A came in better than expected due to leverage on higher-than-planned sales and, to a lesser extent, a shift in timing of certain investments.  Operating income for the quarter was $401 million or 20.1% of net revenue compared to 16.1% of net revenue in Q1 2022. Tax expense for the quarter was $119 million or 29.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to accruing for withholding tax on our unremitted earnings in Canada and a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.  Net income for the quarter increased 54% to $290 million or $2.28 per diluted share compared to $1.48 for the first quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were $137 million for the quarter compared to $111 million in the first quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and also technology and supply chain investments. Turning now to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $951 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 24%, in line with sales growth and was $1.58 billion at the end of Q1. We remain comfortable with our inventories, and we're well positioned to continue to fulfill guest demand. At the end of Q2, we expect inventory growth of approximately 20%. And we continue to expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth in the second half of 2023. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares at an average price of $336. At the end of Q1, we had $646 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.  Let me shift now to our guidance outlook. We continue to be mindful of the uncertainties in the macro environment, and as a result, we remain prudent as it relates to planning the business. That being said, we're pleased with the strength we experienced across the business in Q1 and also the start we've seen to Q2. The strength affords us the opportunity to invest in our strategic growth pillars while also delivering on our financial commitments we've laid out in our Power of Three x2 growth plan.  Let me begin with Q2. We expect revenue in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion, representing growth of 15% to 16%. We expect to open 9 net new company-operated stores in Q2. We expect gross margin in Q2 to increase 200 to 220 basis points relative to Q2 of 2022. This will be driven by lower airfreight expense, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain, distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation.  In Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 190 to 210 basis points relative to Q2 of 2022. While a portion of this deleverage relates to the timing shift of certain investments, it also reflects our strategic decision to invest more in initiatives to grow brand awareness relative to our initial expectations. These initiatives include top-of-funnel brand building and community activations. When looking at operating margin for Q2, we expect approximately 10 basis points of expansion, inclusive of our decision to increase investment into certain of our strategic initiatives.  Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.52 versus adjusted EPS of $2.20 a year ago. Shifting now to the full year 2023. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.44 billion to $9.51 billion. This range represents growth of 16% to 17% relative to 2022 and is better than our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open approximately 50 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low teens. Our new store openings in 2023 will include 30 to 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these being planned for China.  For the full year, we now forecast gross margin to increase between 180 to 200 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower airfreight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 190 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019.  Turning to SG&A for the full year. We now forecast deleverage of 150 to 170 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has been strong. As I mentioned earlier, this gives us the opportunity to invest behind our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin this year ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually.  When looking at operating margin for the full year of 2023, we now expect it to increase by 30 to 50 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2022 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1%. This is in line with our longer-term tax rate expectations we provided as part of our Power of Three x2 plan and reflects the increase we expect as a result of accruing for Canadian withholding taxes. For Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%.  For the fiscal year 2023, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.74 to $11.94 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases.  We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $660 million to $680 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. A range of $660 million to $680 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. Across lululemon, we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We continue to monitor the environment around us, but 2023 is off to a strong start, and we're pleased with our trends as we've entered quarter 2. Given the strength of our product pipeline, our unique approach to building communities, our international growth prospects and our initiatives to grow brand awareness, I'm optimistic that we will continue to deliver on the goal set forth in our Power of Three x2 growth plan.  And in closing, I want to express my deep gratitude to the leaders and teams across lululemon who continue to deliver these results and bring our culture to life. I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Rakesh Patel : Can you dig a little deeper into the sources of the revenue beat versus your expectations? And as you look ahead, which categories and geographies do you have the most confidence in as we think about the rest of the year? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Rick. I'll talk about the drivers overall of our business and then chat quickly on how I see sort of the different regions continue to perform the rest of the year. At a high level, our business model is uniquely different versus our peers with some key competitive advantages, which begin with our D2C omni operating model.  Second is clearly our product driven by our innovation platform of Science of Feel. And then within that, our product assortment is supported with a large portion which is nonseasonal; the versatility and multiple wear occasions, which cross both sweat and social; as well as the frequency of our new innovative drops that guests wait for and have become accustomed to; and finally, the community connection that we drive through a lot of our initiatives and then recently, the launch of our Essential memberships program and lululemon Studio. And if we zoom out, the drivers of our business pre, during and post the pandemic are still very relevant today, and that is the importance of product versatility as it relates to apparel; guests living an active and healthy lifestyle; convenience expected by our guests, which really speaks to our strength in an omni operating model that we've been investing in for many years; and then finally, focus on both physical, mental and social well-being, all supporting the brand positioning. And those continue to be the drivers that separate us from others and fuel our performance.  And when I look at regional performance, as we've shared, strong growth in North America, internationally -- with international all at double-digit growth. And I expect that to continue as we see balanced growth in every market across gender, category and activity. And with the product pipeline, I don't see that; changing. So I think still balanced and very healthy growth ahead. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on a great start to the year. Calvin, I wanted to talk about sort of kind of entry-level pricing strategy as you enter new markets, China, Spain. How do you price into those markets at the onset? And then how do you think about building price on a long-term basis, being able to raise those in those markets over time? And then, Meghan, if you could just talk to us about kind of the relative segment margin, how we should think about the relativity between North America, APAC/China, I guess, would be the primary driver there, and EMEA. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. On pricing, we enter markets with our similar premium positioning of the brand with the intent to sell at full price with markdowns being used only as a means to exit through seasonal shifts in product and not leverage promotional discounting in order to fuel and create demand. We go in with the intent of having parity -- a close range of parity around markets. And then we make adjustments either because of cost of operating within the market, it could be import taxes or other elements. And there may be a slight shift as a result of local competition and strategically. But a tight band and always with the intent of selling full price with moderate discounting, leveraging markdowns as a typical course to exit. So a very similar policy in positioning of supporting full price. Meghan Frank : Great. And Adrienne, in terms of regional profitability, we saw meaningful expansion in our operating margin for the quarter relative to last year and would have experienced that across both our channels and our regions. And then in terms of how we think about the relative margin rates by region, North America is our most profitable, followed by APAC, China within that is the highest, and then EMEA. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Congrats again. Meghan Frank : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : Really nice acceleration in the international business. I guess as we think about the revenue guidance for the year, obviously, you raised overall today, but just curious if there have been any changes to your thinking relative to 3 months ago in terms of the contribution from North America versus international over the remaining quarters.  And then kind of just drilling down in China, you've had some unique activation events over the past few months. I'm curious your learnings there. And any data or anecdotes you have on how the brand is being perceived in some of the newer markets you've entered? Any differences in what the product mix looks like in core versus fashion or sweat versus on-the-move in some of these newer markets and newer consumers? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Mark. So in terms of top line for the balance of the year, we're obviously coming off of a very strong quarter, which exceeded our expectations at 24% growth. We did guide to 15% to 16% for Q2 and then 16% to 17% for the full year, so both above our Power of Three x2 targets. So feeling well positioned for the balance of the year.  We're not breaking out the regional performance, but still see meaningful opportunity across both our North America and international regions, obviously, international being a bit outsized, as Calvin mentioned, given the strength we continue to experience and see, particularly in our China region. Calvin McDonald : I'll -- on China and the activations that you referenced, as you know, our go-to-market strategy is about building community relationships in connection locally, either through ambassadors and then into -- and with our guests. And that strategy is working incredibly well in China. We've done a number of activations both at the local level, store level as well as larger events. We have a few planned for this summer and into the fall. And those are driving the brand awareness, which I think I've shared with everyone before is in the single digit. So we have a huge opportunity to keep building brand awareness and consideration.  As we enter new markets, that is one way as well that we are driving brand awareness and consideration. We have good success in our Tier 1 cities and ability to keep building stores as well as in Tier 2. And in each of those cases, stores are performing -- all stores are performing ahead of plan. So we're very pleased with the way the brand is being received, built upon that community model and driving momentum in all new markets that we enter. We now have 101 stores with plans to continue to open this year and then into next moving forward.  When I look at the overall mix, I'd say our men's and women's business is almost similar to that of North America, which is good considering the age of the brand there. So it's becoming quicker, earlier, the North America dual-gender brand. And we're pleased with the balance between both OTM and sweat. The brand is still rooted as a performance premium brand, and it's playing to our strength of versatility and wear occasions across lounge and social that we're seeing in that market. So very pleased with how product is being received and the momentum, and it really is built upon community activations as you alluded to. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : Meghan, can you talk about some of the investments that you're pulling forward? What do they pertain to? And then maybe just a little bit more detail on plans to increase brand awareness in China outside of just opening stores. Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks, Lorraine. So in terms of SG&A investments, we're obviously experiencing strong top line, and we've seen some recovery in our airfreight expense for the balance of the year. So we see an opportunity to push into investments into our road map behind our Power of Three x2 growth pillars. So specifically, those would be in market expansion in our international regions, enhancing, I would say, guest experience, omni capabilities as well as digital and guest support and then important foundational investments across the business. And these would also include brand awareness opportunities where we continue to push in there for the balance of the year and then also higher depreciation on current and prior year investments in terms of capital expenditure. And then can you remind me the second part of your question, Lorraine? Lorraine Maikis : The plans to build brand awareness in China. Calvin McDonald : I'll take that, Lorraine. So in addition to the stores, as you mentioned, which are one of our top vehicles to do and achieve brand awareness and consideration, we also activate a number of campaigns and do so locally. So they may take a global campaign and then activate it locally, build upon it. That's the example of the Get Into It campaign that we did globally, which was all around our women's leggings initiative.  They also will create a market-specific activation campaign, which we're in right now called Worn By Us, which is a fantastic campaign where they are celebrating and highlighting all the ambassadors that we have relationships with, their favorite products and telling their story of inspiration and how they live a well-being life. And we have many more of those plans. So we definitely invest in campaign and traditional brand marketing in that market to achieve the awareness and consideration opportunity. And leveraging digital, which is a big part of our business. We expanded channels. We have .cn. We have Tmall. We added JD. We continue to innovate and do a variety of initiatives across WeChat, leveraging the WeCom platform for a lot of our one-to-one and one-to-many initiatives and plugging into our community. So there are a lot of exciting things.  And as you know, we have a leader in [ Sanyan ] that is based in Mainland China, in Shanghai. We have a specific SSE office where we have talent and resources that are specifically focused on driving these initiatives and building the business in Greater China and Mainland China. So those are just a few of the initiatives that have been executed -- executing, but we have a team on the ground that's empowered to build that business. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on the results. As you think about the benefit in the margin of the 430 basis points, I believe, of freight reduction, how should we think of that through the year? And what are you seeing in terms of AUR? And with the extensive product innovation this year, how are you planning AUR? And are you seeing any difference regionally, and even globally, in terms of level of reception to new products and consumer differentiation? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Dana. In terms of airfreight, so we are expecting it to be down 190 basis points now for the year. So that is now 50 basis points above 2019 levels. So we made some great headway there. We did experience 430 basis points product margin expansion in Q1, which was primarily driven by airfreight. We will see the year-over-year comparison moderate throughout the year with Q4 being close to flat to last year, and we'll continue to monitor and push into opportunities there. I'd say in terms of AUR, we're not expecting any material change to our AUR strategy in terms of the assortment. And then I'll let Calvin take the last part. Calvin McDonald : Yes. Dana, in terms of product newness and how it may differ globally, one of the benefits of our business is that, predominantly, a global assortment strategy drives the momentum across every market and region. And obviously, there's a huge number of benefits to that. And there are a few nuances by market and some that we designed into. So one in particular in APAC is fit, where we have a whole different fit classification for our leggings, for our bras and for inseams on the men's bottoms. And we introduced that a few years ago, and it has really helped in driving those categories in those markets. Footwear, as you know, we've rolled out in only a few international markets. So even though we see demand in -- for that category and guests asking for it, as of now, it's in Mainland China, it's in the U.K. and in North America. Seasonality is an obvious factor. And then the only other difference that I would call out is we can see and do see differences globally based on the power of social media in certain platforms. So in markets in which a lot of the U.S.-based social influencers have a large voice, we see similar trends, the Everywhere Belt Bag, the Define Jacket. And in markets where we don't see the same type of U.S.-based social media influence, there are other trends, and we don't see quite the distortion in these items. But overall, I think the main message is outside of fit, which is, by design, a global assortment strategy that is more similar than not and drives the momentum across every market. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Tracy Kogan : It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. First, I was wondering if you could tell us the progression in the quarter by month and whether you saw any falloff at all in the U.S. business as some others have seen. And then secondly, I was just hoping you could give us your current views on the competitive landscape in the U.S. and the macro backdrop. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Tracy. In terms of months, so we don't break out monthly performance specifically. But what I would share is that we saw double-digit comp increases each month of the quarter. February was our strongest month, followed by April and then March. And coming off of the 24% sales growth, we're pleased to be able to guide to 15% to 16% in Q2 and then 16% to 17% for the full year. Obviously, planning multiple scenarios as we move into the balance of the year but feel well positioned. Calvin McDonald : And in terms of competitive and macro, we continue to, as we always have, monitor the actions that are taking place both in the competitive land -- I think I've talked before about pricing. That was a strategic decision last year to take very minimal price activity, and that allowed us to continue to support our full-price selling, in particular, when most others had to course-correct and pull the promotional lever to adjust. And we're going to continue to manage that. We are seeing inventory levels come in better positioning. So although I'm anticipating further discounting in the marketplace, I don't expect it will be worse than it has been, and our business has continued to perform well during that heavily promoted period. And as you saw, we got our inventory this quarter ahead of guidance and in line with our revenue number. So from a competitive perspective, I think we're well positioned and have an exciting, innovative pipeline of product to come for the back half of this year, and that always fuels our business. And I'm excited with what I see and what's coming for both the male guest and our female guest. On macro, with the uncertainty, as we've done for the past 2 years, we're going to continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios, monitor it. Our guest metrics were healthy in Q1 in terms of both traffic transaction and new guest acquisition, but we're continuing to monitor and we'll adjust as we need to. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Congrats on another great quarter. So Calvin, on the broad-based global strength of the brand, have you seen any change with the North America core consumer? Can you elaborate on drivers of the outside store comps that you're seeing? And just any overall change in global momentum that you've seen here in May? And then Meghan, with markdowns 40 basis points favorable to 2019 in the first quarter, I guess, can you elaborate on full-price selling trends, your better-than-planned inventory? And just does this create potential opportunity in the back half of the year as we think about markdowns and the opportunity in terms of a year ago? Calvin McDonald : I'll take the first part. In terms of our guest metrics, they remain very strong. We've seen no change in our cohort behavior in terms of frequency of purchase or engagement. In addition, in quarter 1, transactions by existing guests increased 22%, and our transactions by new guests increased 28%. And traffic was also strong across both channels with stores up over 30% and e-comm up approximately 30%.  And when I look globally across every region, that behavior, we don't share the numbers specifically, but the general behavior of very healthy new guest acquisition, very healthy transaction and engagement with existing guests as well as traffic to both channels continue. Some of the differences, what's driving, one, brand awareness and consideration is low and represents a significant runway of growth and opportunity for our business. And as we build new doors, as we continue to feed incredible, exciting, innovative product, that is helping to fuel our business and will continue to, as I've alluded to. I mean international was 16% of our revenue and represents a significant opportunity for us, as we all know, going forward for this brand.  And then from a store performance versus our peer set, while we're equally able to continue to grow, our online business speaks to the strength of our omni guest relationship and strategies. It's really immaterial where they choose to shop, and the technology links both channels together for a very frictionless fluid flow. And we have guests coming to us and into both channels and interacting with the brand accordingly. And that's obviously supported by a D2C model that allows them to do that and not have any other intermediary getting in the way of the relationships we have.  So I think those are a few of the drivers. But very, very strong guest metrics shared across the regions with opportunity with brand awareness to keep building our business moving forward. Meghan Frank : Great. And then in terms of markdowns, so we were pleased with our performance in Q1. So markdowns flat to 2022, and then as you mentioned, slightly under 2019. Our expectation right now embedded in our guidance is that we continue to expect markdowns to be generally flat year-over-year, which will also make a slot to 2019 levels. And really pleased with our performance in top line in Q1 as well as the full-price trend that was embedded in that. And we'll continue to closely monitor. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Meghan, just 2 quick ones on the model for me just to kind of follow up Matt's question. 3 months ago, you had said you expected higher markdowns year-over-year in 1Q through 3Q. They were flat in 1Q. Now you're kind of saying that it should be flat the rest of the year. So just where did that -- I'm just kind of curious if you could comment on the improvement that you thought versus 3 months ago. And then now with the airfreight up to 190, is there any additional airfreight potential upside into fiscal '24? Or would that kind of give you like fully recaptured freight dynamics at that point? Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks. Yes, I'd say the change in markdown performance really came through the outperformance on top line and the portion of that, that came through full-price sales. So when we look at the balance of the year, we're expecting generally in line for the full year, but there is an outperformance in Q1.  And then for airfreight, we are now 190 basis points down to last year, still 50 basis points above 2019 levels. We do expect over the longer term to continue to push into recouping all of that airfreight amount. So I think too soon to put a fine point on 2024, but we continue to make good progress on that line item, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Congrats on another great quarter. Just firstly, did you guys observe any deviation in purchase behavior by household income level across the quarter? And then secondly, just zooming out, margins sit hundreds of basis points above pre-COVID levels. It's really amazing. So can you just walk us through the puts and takes of that? Is it just sales leverage or other pieces -- moving pieces there would be helpful. Meghan Frank : Great. In terms of guest metrics, nothing material by household income. We were pleased, I would say, overall guest metrics, both existing and new gas metric trends, above 20% for the quarter. And then can you remind me, sorry, of the second part of your question? Alexandra Straton : Just margin sitting so much higher than pre-COVID levels, yes, the key puts and takes there. Meghan Frank : And sorry, are you speaking specifically to gross margin? Alexandra Straton : Both gross and operating. Meghan Frank : Yes. So our operating margin is pretty flat to 2019 levels. And then I'd say in terms of gross margin, we're well above given the composition of our business has shifted to be -- we pulled back somewhat on new store openings. The cost of that is within gross margin. And then we've invested more deeply behind the digital portions of our business. It's in SG&A. And then, obviously, a big piece through scale and revenue outperformance. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I was hoping you could speak to the opportunity to build on the success of the platform strategy that you've built so far. How are you thinking about balancing new innovation within key platforms like the Align versus building out new product platforms that can be built upon in the future? And then, Meghan, can you elaborate on your inventory outlook? What is the path to improve inventory turn from here? And how should we be thinking about the time line to repacing that prepandemic inventory turnover rate? Calvin McDonald : Brooke, in terms of product, we definitely think of it through the lens of a hero item strategy, a franchise expansion strategy and then newness that could either show up as a new item and/or franchise. So that's what has been fueling our business. And then equally in that, not only bringing newness but going back as well as updating, like we did in this quarter, for instance, on our Pace Breaker short, for instance, for him where we took a fantastic single hero item and we've innovated it with a number of changes that have been incredibly well received. In the franchise lineup, we're always looking at strengths and ways in which the positioning of that, either through fit, versatility, functionality and/or fabric can be extended into additional unmet needs for the guest. The Align being one of our strongest franchises, we introduced the Align dress this quarter, which was incredibly well received. And equally building new franchises, either through the introduction like we did last year with footwear, which we've declared as a test and learn for us. But we're excited with the initial results and success in being able to build that forward into a very positive business in general. And there are additional ones that we'll be launching later this year that really fit into that franchise category that we're really, really excited about.  So we definitely take a strategy across category activity, hero item franchise, look for ways to expand, look for ways to update and then obviously ways to create new and then -- and build from that. Meghan Frank : Great. And then in terms of inventory, so our expectation is we'll be approximately 20% at the end of Q2 and then inventory in line with sales in the second half of the year. We will still have opportunities, as you mentioned, to get our inventory turns back to historical levels. We have seen some material improvements in supply chain and lead times but not all the way back to historical positioning. So too soon to say when we'll move back to those levels, but that would be the goal over the longer term. Operator : The next question comes from Abbie Zvejnieks with Piper Sandler. Abigail Zvejnieks : Just on the growth of the Other segment, can you break out, I guess, or just comment on what of that is driven by lululemon Studio versus other components? And then any numbers you can give on early subscriptions or learnings or loyalty numbers? Meghan Frank : Yes. In terms of the Other segment, we aren't breaking out lululemon Studio as a portion of that. But that bucket also contains strategic sales, seasonal stores and outlets, which would be a larger revenue component and the material driver in that bucket. And then in terms of early statistics? Calvin McDonald : Well, we just launched -- so a couple of things in terms of that. We just launched a few days ago our digital app for lululemon Studio, which is $12.99 a month and gives guests access to the same content that you can get but without the hardware purchase. We're excited to introduce that. We think it will expand the TAM and allow us to offer that offering into the membership program.  Last quarter, I talked to the membership number of essentials, which after 6 months was a real strong start, over 8 million. We're not going to share that number quarterly, but I will indicate it's continued very strong momentum and continue to grow. So we're excited about Essential memberships, how it's going to support our community, fit into lululemon Studio, the benefit of sweat and other means to interact with our guests and drive both LTV and incrementality. And early with having these tools all supporting the membership program, we'll share more as we move forward, but excited as we continue to see strength in that Essential membership base grow. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's second quarter earnings conference call.

During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the second quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'm pleased to be here with everyone to discuss our quarter 2 results. Today, I'll share the highlights of our recent performance and speak to some of the exciting product launches and activations we have planned for the second half of the year. As you've read in our press release, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as our core product and new launches continue to resonate strongly with guests in markets around the world. On today's call, I will provide details on our quarter 2 performance, I'll then speak to our outlook and the many opportunities we have across the business. Next, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of the financials and the guidance update, and then we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Our business remained strong in quarter 2 with both revenue and EPS exceeding our expectations. Revenue increased 18% versus last year with strength across our portfolio. Comparable sales grew 9% in stores and 17% in our e-commerce business and adjusted EPS increased 22% versus the same period last year. These results demonstrate the strength of the business and how we are well positioned for the second half of 2023. In fact, we are seeing our strong momentum continue into quarter 3 and expect revenue growth in the 17% to 18% range for the quarter. Meghan will share our detailed guidance with you later in the call. Let's now look at quarter 2 in more detail as I share some highlights on product innovation, brand building strategies and regional performance. When looking at product, we posted strong double-digit growth across women's, men's and accessories as we bring newness and innovation into our assortment. Specifically in quarter 2, women's increased 16%, men's was up 15% and accessories increased 44%. In women's, guests are responding very well to our core franchises as well as our newer play activities. We continue to see strength in our key franchises, including scuba, define and our dance studio jogger. In addition, Softstreme has emerged as another meaningful franchise for us. In quarter 2, we saw strength across the collection with guests responding well to our offering. Turning to play, our tennis and golf collections remain strong performers for us. As we've shared before, our strategy with play is to solve for our guests' unmet needs across their secondary sweat activities. We introduced styles designed specifically for these activities while continuing to leverage the versatility of our core assortment. In men's, I'd like to highlight the ongoing strength we're seeing in our ABC franchise, 1 of our most popular for him. Our teams continue to expand and evolve the assortment, which now includes 4 styles and 4 fits and is available in 3 proprietary fabrics, Warpstreme, Utilitech and WovenAir with additional fabrics in solves for unmet needs planned for upcoming seasons. As we expand this trusted franchise, we are gaining share of wallet from existing guests, while at the same time, attracting new guests to our brand. In accessories, our entire bag assortment is performing well. Crossbody styles, backpacks and small pouches are helping drive these results and contributed to the 44% growth in accessories in quarter 2. Our teams will continue to create innovative solutions over the coming months and seasons as we realize the meaningful opportunity to expand our bag assortment. Looking specifically at the Everywhere Belt Bag, I am pleased we generated strong double-digit growth on top of last year's strength. Consistent with our strategy to develop franchises from our most popular styles, our accessories team expanded our assortment of Everywhere Belt Bags across multiple sizes, color waves, prints and patterns and the guests are responding incredibly well. Turning to footwear. We are making steady progress in this category, and I'm excited with how our team continues to evolve the offering. We recently introduced Chargefeel 2, an update to our most versatile run to train style, and we are gearing up for the launch of men's footwear next year. Looking now at the second half of the year, I am pleased with our pipeline of innovation. In women's, we will launch an exciting new collection in the fall, which will show our continued ability to address the unmet needs of our guests. Stay tuned for additional details. On the men's side, recently in quarter 3, we launched 2 new franchises, the steady state and our soft jersey collection, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Steady state is constructed from the same fabric used in our scuba franchise, and is a great example of how we can leverage our technical fabrics across genders. Our soft jersey collection includes several styles, all in our jersey fabric, which provides guests with incredible softness and is quick drying, stretchy and sweat-wicking. These collections enhance our men's lounge offering and are consistent with how we view our overall On The Move assortment. These products are designed for lounge but made from technical fabric and offer performance features. Later in quarter 3, we will expand our outerwear offering with new styles of vests, jackets and waterproof down. And in quarter 4, we will launch a new performance fabric designed specifically for cold weather runs. These are just a few examples of how we consistently bring innovation into our core while at the same time, expand into new categories. We are still in the early innings of our product journey and have significant opportunity ahead of us as we continue to solve for the unmet needs of our guests. While product innovation is a key tenet of our Power of Three x2 growth plan, we also have a real opportunity to increase our brand awareness. As we previously discussed, our unaided brand awareness is still only 25% in the United States. And with the exception of the U.K. and Australia, our unaided awareness remains in the single digits in every market in which we operate outside of North America. In 2023, we have accelerated our efforts to increase awareness and consideration for lululemon, and we are seeing gains in key growth markets across the globe. Last quarter, we spoke about several initiatives, including the initial phases of our Get Into It campaign, our Dupe Swap event in Los Angeles and the launch of the further initiative. In quarter 3, we have several activations and campaigns on deck that will support our key product launches, begin to build excitement for the upcoming holiday season and increase overall awareness of the lululemon brand across the globe. Let me share some highlights. Given the positive reception to our Get Into It campaign, we'll continue to highlight our leadership position in bottoms with another installment in quarter 3. For women, the campaign will focus on our core franchises and feature our global ambassador and professional tennis player, Leylah Fernandez. And for men, we'll elevate our ABC franchise with the support from some fun and exciting special guests. The campaign will include digital media assets across our stores and e-commerce sites. As well, we'll also test some targeted television in the U.S. In EMEA, we will build on our soft launch with Zalando in June with a larger consumer-facing launch on this popular e-commerce site. Our relationship with Zalando is not wholesale as we fulfill orders ourselves, and it is an excellent way for us to bring new guests into the lululemon brand across Europe, where Zalando is a strong and leading player. And finally, we'll release our global well-being index in the coming weeks to raise awareness and celebrate World Mental Health Day in October. We are excited about the ongoing opportunity to grow brand awareness in the U.S. and across all our international markets. Our grassroots approach to building community and engaging with guests remains unchanged, but we are also increasing the number and frequency of larger scale activations and global brand campaigns. And we are doing this within the confines of our P&L and keeping overall marketing spend relatively stable as a percentage to sales on an annual basis. In addition, the continued acceleration in our top line unlocks dollars that we are then able to strategically invest behind our initiatives to drive brand awareness, leveraging both earned and paid media in new and creative ways. Shifting now to our regional growth drivers. We continue to see broad-based strength. Specifically, revenue in North America grew 11% in quarter 2 and international increased 52%. Within international, we delivered strong growth across all markets and continue to see great acceptance of our brand in Greater China, where revenue grew 61%. Within North America, we remain pleased with the underlying strength of the business with double-digit growth in quarter 2, consistent with our Power of Three x2 target, and we continue to gain market share. In quarter 2, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue compared to the same period last year. Over this time period, lululemon gained 1.3 points of market share in the U.S. with gains in both men's and women's according to Circana's consumer tracking service. In the back half of 2023, as I mentioned, we have a compelling pipeline of innovation planned. We will continue to focus on acquiring new guests as we solve for their unmet needs. And thus far in quarter 3, I can also share that we are seeing our business in North America accelerate relative to quarter 2. Turning to international. Our business remains strong and balanced across regions. In quarter 2, total international represented 22% of sales versus 17% in quarter 2 last year. And while expanding nicely, this penetration still remains below our long-term target, which reinforces just how early we are in our growth journey. Let me now share some recent regional highlights. In China, we celebrated the National Fitness Day in August with the third installment of our summer sweat games. Through this activation, our local teams hosted regional competitions across the country which culminated in a national final held this past weekend in Shenzhen. This year, the games included 3,400 participants from more than 100 stores in 36 cities. Our APAC and EMEA region also continued to perform well. In Australia, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our store optimization program as well as the recent rollout of ship from store in this market. This is our most mature market outside of North America, and we still have ample opportunity to drive growth this year and into the foreseeable future. We also opened our first store in Thailand in July, which marked the 100th location in the APAC region. The pent-up demand for the lululemon brand in this market was clear and the opening of the store in Bangkok was our strongest ever in the APAC region. In addition, we've seen a noticeable uptick in travel and tourism within APAC, which is also having a positive impact on our business. And in EMEA, in August, we opened our second store in Amsterdam, which reflects our expanding community and our ongoing investment in this key European city to grow the lululemon brand. It's incredibly exciting for all of us at lululemon to see the strong acceptance of our brand across all markets within our international business. With each new store opening, we see a groundswell of support that welcomes lululemon into the community. Our runway for growth is substantial, and I am optimistic about the future as we continue to expand our business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our updated guidance. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. Our momentum remains strong in Q2, enabling us to exceed both our top and bottom line guidance. In addition, our inventory growth continued to moderate about 14% versus our guidance of approximately 20%, and it remains well positioned from both a level and composition standpoint. I'm also excited to see our sales strength continuing into Q3 as guests are responding well to our back-to-school and early fall product innovations. Now let's dive into our Q2 financials. For Q2, total net revenue rose 18% to $2.2 billion, driven by broad-based strength across the business. Comparable sales increased 13% with a 9% increase in stores and a 17% increase in e-commerce. In our store channel, total sales increased 21% versus last year. We ended the quarter with a total of 672 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 72 net new lululemon stores since Q2 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 10 net new stores and completed 4 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues totaled $894 million or 40% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 11% versus last year. Within international, we saw a 52% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 61%. And by category, women's revenue increased 16% versus last year, men's increased 15% and accessories grew 44%. It's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In both stores and digital channels, traffic increased over 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.3 billion or 58.8% of net revenue compared to 56.5% of net revenue in Q2 2022. The gross profit rate in Q2 increased 230 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 330 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from freight favorability, we remain pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of the strong gains over the last several years. The combination of product and supply chain costs and occupancy deleveraged 70 basis points in the quarter, driven predominantly by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain. We also saw 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $817 million or 37% of net revenue compared to 35.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. We achieved better-than-expected deleverage in the quarter, driven predominantly by our top line strength while continuing to invest behind our strategic initiatives to build brand awareness among additional investments we've accelerated to fuel our Power Of Three x2 road map. Foreign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 60 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $479 million or 21.7% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 20.9% of net revenue in Q2 2022. Tax expense for the quarter was $145 million, or 29.8% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 28.2% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $342 million or $2.68 per diluted share compared to adjusted EPS of $2.20 for the second quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $146 million for the quarter compared to approximately $145 million in the second quarter last year. The spend in Q2 of this year relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, technology and supply chain costs. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2, up 14% versus last year. At the end of Q3, we expect inventory to be up in the high single to low double digits versus last year. The relatively low growth rate is due to the provision for MIRROR hardware we took in Q4 2022 and have not yet anniversaried. In Q4, we continue to expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth. We repurchased approximately 517,000 shares at an average price of $371. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $454 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program. Let me shift now to our guidance outlook. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of our business as Q2 exceeded our expectations, and Q3 is off to a solid start. The upside we've seen in the first half of the year allows us to invest into our strategic initiatives to set ourselves up for future growth, while at the same time, flowing some of that upside through to the bottom line. With that being said, we remain aware of the uncertainties that exist in the current macro environment and consistent with our approach over the last several years, we continue to be prudent and plan the business for multiple scenarios. Now let me begin with Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $2.165 billion to $2.19 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We expect to open 23 net new company-operated stores in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to increase 160 to 180 basis points relative to Q3 of 2022. This will be driven by lower freight expense, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain, distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation. In Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 200 to 220 basis points relative to Q3 2022. This deleverage continues to reflect our strategic decision to invest in growth initiatives including those to grow brand awareness globally. When looking at operating margin for Q3, we expect approximately 40 basis points of contraction relative to last year. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.28 versus EPS of $2 a year ago. Shifting to the full year 2023. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.51 billion to $9.57 billion. This range represents growth of 17% to 18% relative to 2022 and exceeds the revenue target in our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We now expect to open approximately 55 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low teens. Our new store openings in 2023 will include approximately 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these planned for China. For the full year, we now forecast gross margin to increase between 190 and 210 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 210 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We continue to forecast deleverage of 150 to 170 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has been strong. As I mentioned earlier, this gives us the opportunity to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin this year ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually. When looking at operating margins for the full year 2023, we now expect it to increase 40 to 60 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5%. For the fiscal year 2023, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.02 to $12.17 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2023. This increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including the continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Our range of $670 million to $690 million is approximately 7% of revenue in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. As these results demonstrate, we arrive at the midpoint of 2023 in a very strong position for what's ahead. We continue to deliver sustained growth in the business through a steady drumbeat of product category and market expansions that connects us with our guests on a regular basis. We recognize the significant opportunity in front of us and we remain focused on both delivering a successful 2023 and achieving our goals contained within the Power of Three x2 growth plan. My confidence in our leadership and our people remains extremely high as we consistently demonstrate our ability to deliver for our guests and our shareholders. I'm grateful to the many teams across lululemon who champion our brand every day and make these results possible. And now we look forward to taking your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : And congrats on another nice quarter. So Calvin, could you elaborate on the broad-based global strength, notably customer demand that you saw in North America and China as the second quarter progressed. And then on more recent trends, could you just speak to drivers of the strong August momentum and the acceleration that you cited in North America? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. Similar to the success through the first half of this year, which is really driven from our core product as well as our new innovation across both performance and OTM categories across both women's and men's -- so it continues to be that balanced growth across categories, channels, both stores, e-comm and all markets that's fueling the business. And heading into Q3, there's really no change to that formula, and the team is doing a wonderful job and guests are responding to the new innovation that we are launching. I referenced a few on the call, the soft jersey, steady state for him. We have some exciting innovation still to come. So I think it's just a continuation of low unaided brand awareness, and we are launching initiatives to get at that opportunity, incredible product opportunity and the teams delivering on that on unmet needs and our international business, which, in addition to North America is still performing very strongly, double-digit in line with our Power of Three x2 growth targets, seeing acceleration across every market in the globe we're in. So -- it really is a reflection of my consistent message of us being early innings and balanced growth across all opportunity we have and a team that's delivering on that potential. Matthew Boss : That's great. And then, Meghan, could you just speak to the overall health and composition of your current inventory position as we head into the back half. And just how best to think about markdowns in the third quarter? Or are there any constraints to recapturing the markdown headwinds that you incurred in the fourth quarter a year ago? Meghan Frank : Yes, absolutely, Matt. So in terms of inventory, so we came in up 14% at the end of the quarter, our expectation was approximately 20%. Relative to our expectation, there were a few items that drove that balance lower. So the first would be revenue upside above our expectations. Second being lower air freight costs and then the third being some timing implications. And in terms of how we're looking at inventory for the balance of the year, at the end of Q3, we're expecting high single to low double digits. And then in Q4, end of Q4, relatively in line with sales as we move into 2024. So I would say overall, we're really pleased with the currency and also the level of our inventory. In terms of markdowns, nothing really to note on the quarters. We're still expecting markdowns to be relatively flat on an annual basis for '23 over '22, and that's consistent also with our 2019 levels, which is a normalized healthy level for us. We run a low markdown penetration, high full price penetration business. We were flat in Q2, markdowns year-over-year, and I wouldn't expect any anomalies in Q3 and Q4. Operator : The next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Congratulations. The results are really -- they really stand-alone. Calvin, so the business is being driven by innovation, product launches and newness, whereas sort of the competitive backdrop is a little bit more safe. And I'm just wondering how -- have you been able to sort of inspire that? It feels like you're innovating faster. Every time you get on a call, there's like another list of 5 new things that we didn't know about. So I'm just wondering, have you accelerated the innovation turnover time, the pipeline or the investment? And then Meghan, if you can just talk to us about kind of the China, the opportunity there, the sales are almost double sort of what you have in Canada and the year-to-date sales are roughly similar at $0.5 billion. So just kind of talking about the improvement there and what you think about the opportunities there? Calvin McDonald : All right. Thanks, Adrienne. In terms of our speed of innovation, I would agree that the pipeline and the launches within each quarter continue to get very strong and excited about the balance across our accessories business, our women's business, our men's business. I think it is an execution of a very deliberate innovation strategy that we've been working through the Power of Three and into the Power of Three x2 strategy. You've heard me reference our play categories and being very deliberate in terms of what we design into and then leveraging our core, how we leverage versatility, but continue to innovate against some of those core hero franchises that he and she loves so that we don't simply launch and then just allow it to run without enhancements, improvements and adding to. Sharing across gender. For instance, in this quarter, we took our famous scuba fabric and brought that into a steady state for him, which was an opportunity we saw in our assortment that we were missing. So I think what you continue to see is just the team executing on the strategy. We have a horizon of innovation across horizons 1, 2, 3, which can be anywhere from 1 to 3, 4 years as we keep looking to solve the unmet needs of our guests and where and how, but we have a lot that we're able to bring forward and commercialize as well as having a lot that the team continues to work on for future quarters and future years. And feel very excited about our ability to sell through core, innovate core and then bring true innovation to the guest through that notion of unmet needs versus unmet wants. And I think that's driving our business that we're truly solving, which is a unique standout in this marketplace. Meghan Frank : And then, Adrienne, in terms of China, we are really pleased with the performance there in the quarter, up 61% in Greater China. We have 100 stores today in China. We're opening 35 stores in an international region this year, the majority of those in the China market. As Calvin mentioned, we've had some exciting community activations still looking to build brand awareness and drive into that opportunity there. And then over the longer term, we've set approximately 200 stores at the end of our 5-year plan, and I think -- there's also a beyond there as well in terms of still very early innings on our China growth. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Fantastic results. Best of luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : Meghan, you've pulled a lot of investments forward into 2023 as gross margins continue to be. Can you give us some examples of the most successful investments? And then also talk to your ability to generate leverage on this line item as we move into 2024? Meghan Frank : Absolutely, Lorraine. So we've been really excited with the revenue momentum we've had and then also the progress that we've made on recouping air freight expense. So our guidance now on revenue is 17% to 18% growth ahead of our original target and then margin, guiding to 190 to 210 basis points with airfreight really being the driver there. So what it's done is it's given us the ability to invest behind our Power of Three x2 road map. So that would include market expansion, notably international, specifically China as a key focus there, improving guest experience and omni capabilities and then a foundational investments to drive the business forward. And I think coupled with that, what we're really excited with is you heard us talk on Analyst Day about the tremendous opportunity we have in brand awareness. And this upside has given us an opportunity, particularly in the second half of this year to invest in marketing activations to drive that brand awareness, really capitalizing on some of the key innovation moments we have coming up in the second half of the year. So that, we believe, will drive into our long-term opportunity and sustain our momentum. So we're a little bit ahead of where we were. We were expecting to be from a Power of Three x2 initiative road map, and then that's coupled with driving into some upside opportunity on brand awareness. In terms of leverage, we're really focused on operating margin and feel good about maintaining our commitment to modest operating margin expansion over the longer term. I think as we get closer to '24, we'll put a finer point on where we see the components of the P&L shaping up next year. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Just want to talk about the China business. Would love to hear about what sort of volatility you saw in China over the quarter. And if you could talk about how stores performed versus e-comm? And where are store productivity levels running in China currently versus North America? Meghan Frank : Paul, I would say in terms of China volatility, we really didn't experience any over the course of the quarter. I would say, really strong healthy growth across each of the 3 months of the quarter. And then I'll let Calvin comment on store and e-comm performance. Calvin McDonald : In terms of both channels, they're performing incredibly well in the market. We now have 107 stores in Mainland China, predominantly Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, but still see opportunity to grow as well as look to opportunities into Tier 3. Every store we've opened has exceeded plan, our optimization of some stores as we did with our Kerry Center location, which is really our first bigger, more experiential store in country is performing incredibly well. And as you know, online business in China is different than that of other markets where our .cn is a lower percentage of our overall business, and we do work through partners such as Tmall, JD to grow our business. But on the back of those platforms and leveraging some of the B2B and working direct and selling direct to our guests through their clienteling platform. The team is doing some incredible initiatives and learnings for us globally and driving the overall e-commerce business. So very strong in both -- great guest acquisition in both -- it's helping us determine new markets, new opportunities and locations that we can continue to open and build into. And our stores are really driving the brand the way in which we traditionally do in all markets, which is grassroots community and through the educators. And from a productivity standpoint, they're behind North America, but performing very well, just slightly behind. They're smaller in size, but we see a significant opportunity, obviously, in the success of that -- of our store footprint, both productivity driving the brand, coupled with e-comm. So very exciting and good and balanced growth across all of those levers. Paul Lejuez : So what's the profitability in that China market currently versus where you think it can go longer term? Meghan Frank : Yes. I'd say we haven't broken out the profitability specifically. It's very healthy. Closest to our North America region. I think in the near term, what we're really focused on is capitalizing on the opportunity we have in that market, not necessarily maximizing that operating margin, but that would present an opportunity also over the long term as we scale that market. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Calvin, when you talk to international up 52%, I think it's 23% of revenue now. I guess this dovetails into Paul's question, the margin structure of this business is seemingly very high. I think this is your highest quarterly gross margin in history in the second quarter. So maybe just talk to internationally broadly about how that's contributing to the margin expansion you're seeing this year? Calvin McDonald : I'll tee up relative to the market, the success you mentioning at 23% of our sales and where we see the potential across the market. I'll let Meghan speak to the margin. I think we indicated on the last quarter that in every market, every region we're in, we're profitable and early innings of growth didn't seem that long ago when international was 14% of our total sales, 15% of our total sales. So to be crossing the 20% consistently to have it contributing to the growth of the overall business is incredibly exciting to see every market we're in, the business growing double digit and consistently and having some of the lowest unaided brand awareness we have in the company. It's single digit in every market, except for Australia and the U.K. where we've been in the longest, but even there, it's in the teens. So we have a significant runway of growth in international business. And at 23%, I think we really are just getting started. I've shared before that the potential of this brand is, I think, 50-50 beyond our current Power of Three x2. But I don't see anything that would hold us back from being a global brand to that scale, diversified and balanced in multiple markets. and all markets today being profitable with significant growth through product unaided brand awareness. And Meghan, if you want to touch on the margin mix? Meghan Frank : Yes, absolutely. So for the full year, we guided a 40 to 60 basis points of expansion in operating margin year-over-year. That's about 20 to 40 basis points above 2019 levels. So we're really pleased with that performance. Within that international is still below North America profitability. As I mentioned, China being the closest really looking to maximize that market. And then APAC and EMEA, still some opportunity in terms of operating margin expansion in the near term as we continue to scale those markets. So I would say, over the longer term, focused on driving into the brand awareness and revenue opportunity, store expansion we have in the international market, scaling and leveraging over time. John Kernan : Excellent. My 1 follow-up is just on other categories. It's obviously been a bigger driver of revenue. It should be well north of $1 billion annually this year. You talk to the growth of that category line item and how we should think about that going forward? Meghan Frank : Yes. So within our other categories that are franchise businesses as well as seasonal pop-ups, those would be the largest components. We also have outlets in lululemon Studio. I would say the growth being driven by new franchise markets as well as relatively consistent, I would say, performance in terms of seasonals and pop-ups. And so I would say we'll continue to scale markets within that bucket and capitalize on the opportunity we have there with our franchise model with another going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Congrats on another nice quarter. Two questions, I'll shove together. I mean first, I apologize if this is repetitive, but you talked about the further strengthening of your business here into fiscal Q3, specifically August. So -- can you help us understand better, I mean, where -- what's driving that? Are there particular product categories, particularly geographies you're seeing that happen? Then I have a follow-up. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brian. I think it's a combination of some of the new innovation that came out at the tail end of Q2 that is set up in position for sort of back half needs in men's. We've seen incredible response to the soft jersey and steady state. We're geared up for the ABC campaign of Get Into It, which I'm really excited about, having men's play along with women's being featured in that. We've activated accessories across our bags. We've done some digital campaigning in certain regions relative to back to campus, which has resonated well and driven some of our core products in terms of the bottoms in both women's and men's. So -- it's been a variety of activations, a combination of getting at unaided awareness through campaigning, leveraging our core as well as some newness and innovation that is resonating in both he and she are responding very well to and that's consistent across all markets, and we've seen a nice response in North America. So it's a similar formula, a similar approach to that, really driven, I think, from a North American business has responded well, I think, as we head into the fall and back to campus. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful, Calvin. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up question with regard to inventory. So just look at the numbers and given your comments, I mean, you've done a phenomenal job of really rationalizing if you will, inventories. So my question, I mean, given the level of concern that was in the marketplace, say, just a few quarters ago about inventory, both on lulu and in the channel. As you look at your inventories now, are we -- recognize you always have to manage inventories, but are we really now past that critical point? Is there some type of all clear with regard to your inventory and the cleanliness of that inventory? Meghan Frank : Yes. I mean I would say we've made some significant progress. We still have some degree of elevated airfreight in our inventory balance on a cost basis. And so I would say not completely optimized and turns are a little bit slower than history, and our goal over the longer term would to get those inventory turns back to normalized historical rates. So still some opportunity, but I think the team has done a nice job in navigating what was a really dynamic supply chain and positioning inventory so that we were able to capitalize on the demand upside that we saw and experienced. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Dana Telsey : Congratulations on your terrific performance. It's great to see the progress. As you think about the traffic, which was so impactful, both for stores and for e-commerce. Any discussion regarding the loyalty programs? Is that a driver of this? And where do you stand on the loyalty programs with that enhancement? And then Calvin, as you're mentioning new product, I know outerwear is a big thing for last year. How do you see the AUR developing? And are we moving into a higher AUR zone going forward with some of the newness? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Dana. As you mentioned, the traffic was very strong and pretty much completely in line across both stores and e-comm. So continuing to drive that omni strategy and have the guests connect with us wherever is convenient for them, has been a strategy of ours and continues to resonate and drive our business. And we're cycling over the success of some categories and items last year that really drove traffic. So very healthy, strong numbers on top of strong numbers, which is very encouraging as we look at just how the guests both new and existing are engaging with us. I think membership is a part of that. We've had it before membership, but with the membership program obviously is allowing us is more deliberate ways to engage with that guest. And I mentioned that it's not going to be a number we consistently share. But I will indicate that the program continues to far exceed our expectations. We launched this less than a year ago. And we now have 12 million of our guests signed up in North America to the Essentials membership program, which is a significant unlock for us, our teams, it allows us to play into our strength of community, relationship, allows us to leverage benefits that are unique to that guest to that member. And allows us to interact with data and communicate with them that is very effective for our digital marketing teams as well as our store teams and look at the history and assist the guests in the way in which we do. So it is an exciting new program for us that we have a lot of ideas and initiatives planned, how we will continue to leverage. I think it's a part of it. I wouldn't point all to it. I think ultimately, it's the success of the brand, success of our product and product innovation, why the guests comes to lululemon. And we see that continuing through for the Power of Three x2 period and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : Just 2 clarification questions for me. Just on the quarter-to-date North America acceleration, is that full revenue comp or both? And then on China, 60% growth was great. Just kind of curious in terms of the revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, what kind of growth are you guys baking in for China for the back half? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Ike. So in terms of the acceleration in North America specifically, it would be total and comp. In terms of China, we haven't broken out the second half of the year by region. But we are coming off a very strong performance, 61% growth in Q1 -- sorry, Q2 in Greater China. And feeling well positioned as we move into the second half of the year, as I mentioned, 107 stores in China today, 35 stores international. And the majority of those being China openings. And I would say we're pleased with our performance in China as we move into this. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I was hoping you could elaborate on the composition of North America growth between new and existing customers. How are those customer cohorts performing as they enter the brand? And are you seeing any difference in customer behavior by age or income demographic? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. In terms of the overall composition, I'll speak directly to sort of how we view the cohorts. And I think I've mentioned before, that the new guest cohorts are performing and behaving very similar to how that cohort has behaved in past quarters, past years. That's very encouraging for us because we did see through the success last year of the Everywhere Belt Bag that it did pull in a younger guest to see them in the cohort and that cohort behaving similar nature of how they engage the frequency of engagement and the migration of their spend is encouraging. And we still see our business driven by new guests coming in as well as our team's ability to retain existing guests and increase share of wallet and spend with them. So nothing that would signal they're behaving differently in very healthy and contributing factor to the overall business, both with new existing very low retained, very high guest loyalty, longevity and engagement in the brand and responding to the newness and the innovation continues to sort of be that guest formula. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take 1 more question. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Congrats on another good quarter. One for me. Just on the stores, it looks like they could be at over $6 million a pop in revenue or so on average this year. It's definitely a high number per box. So I'm just wondering, maybe Meghan, how do you think about the trajectory from here? What drives that number higher? And on a related note, how do you think about the store growth opportunity from here in North America specifically? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Alex. So in terms of sales per store and sales per square foot, it's definitely a key part of our strategy to expand our box size in locations where we have high sales per square foot, high traffic to capitalize on that traffic. So we are opening approximately 25 what we call co-located stores, which are really expansion. It allows us to have a more holistic assortment across men's, women's accessories, footwear and as I mentioned, capitalize on that traffic trend. So it's a key strategy for us and one that we monitor closely. We're definitely further along in that strategy in North America than we are in our international markets, we're still very early days on that. But still runway, I would say, across both our North America and international region in terms of store expansion and a very measured and deliberate strategy. And then I would say -- sorry, can you remind me the second half of your question? Alexandra Straton : On the store growth opportunity in North America, specifically? Meghan Frank : We haven't broken out the specifics, but I would say we're not dissimilar from this year and square footage growth in the low double digits range. Globally, high single digits in North America. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon Athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable store sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors Section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'd like to welcome everyone to the call today, and I'm happy to discuss our quarter 3 results. On today's call, I'll share some highlights regarding our performance over the Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the holiday season. Next, I'll speak to our quarter 3 results, then you'll hear from Meghan with a review of the financials and an update on guidance, and finally, we'll take your questions. So let's get started with Thanksgiving. We are very pleased with our results over the holiday weekend. In fact, this Black Friday was the single biggest day in company history, with strength across our store and e-commerce channels. Along with several members of the leadership team, I visited stores in Houston, Dallas and Los Angeles, and we were thrilled to join our local teams and experience their energy and excitement firsthand. Our stores were very busy, and our overall performance is driven by strength across both full price and markdown merchandise. This year, we extended an additional benefit to our Essentials members who received early access to our Black Friday styles via our Shop app. This strategy drove a significant spike in app downloads with virtually no incremental marketing costs. We also visited several recently remodeled locations that showed the benefits of our ongoing co-located optimization strategy, including enhanced merchandising of men's, increased traffic flow and improved throughput due to additional guest services and fitting rooms. Finally, our overall success was enabled by the ongoing foundational investments we've been making to our DC network and IT infrastructure to enhance the guest experience, both in stores and online. And while there is nearly 2/3 of the quarter still ahead of us, we are encouraged by our trends at the start of the holiday season. Now looking back at quarter 3. As you saw from our press release, our results remain strong and balanced as both our top and bottom line exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 19% versus last year, comparable sales grew 9% in stores and 19% in our e-commerce business and adjusted EPS increased 27% versus the same period last year, and our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which reflects our optimism in the growth trajectory of the business. Meghan will share the detailed financials later in the call, and I think it's clear our performance continues to speak to the strong response to the Lululemon brand in our markets across the globe and how we remain in the early innings of our growth story. Now let's look at quarter 3 in more detail as I share highlights in 3 areas : product innovation, brand building strategies and regional performance. Let's begin with product. One of our competitive advantages is our ability to consistently bring newness and innovation into our assortment. Our product teams work with our athletes and ambassadors, leverage our Science of Feel innovation platform and solve for the unmet needs of our guests. Quarter 3 was no exception as we introduced several new styles into our assortment. Let me highlight just a few. In quarter 3, our women's business increased 19%, fueled by new product launches, strength in bottoms and ongoing performance in key franchises. As we shared on our last earnings call, we mentioned the launch of a new franchise for women. In quarter 3, we introduced Wundermost, our new collection of bodywear made in our softest fabric ever. By leveraging our expertise in raw materials development, fabric innovation and technical construction, our product teams engineered a brand-new sensation and unique [indiscernible] for our guests. And I'm pleased to share that Wundermost launch has been met with great initial response from our guests and we're excited to keep bringing innovation into this new franchise. Other quarter 3 product highlights on the women's side include bottoms and second layers. Within bottoms, both tights and away-from-body styles performed well, including Align, Wunder Train and the Dance Studio Jogger. In addition, we continue to see success in our key second layer franchises, including Define, Scuba and Softstreme. Looking at quarter 4, you will see fresh seasonal takes on several of our guest favorite franchises, including Scuba, Align and Wunder Train. Shifting now to men's, we saw growth of 15% in quarter 3. Similar to during the COVID-19 period, we see that when there is some uncertainty in the macro environment, men can become a bit more conservative in their apparel purchases. However, growth in our international regions remains very strong. And in North America, our market share gains continue, and we know our guests respond well to product innovation and compelling marketing campaigns. In quarter 3, we launched 2 new men's franchises, Steady State and Soft Jersey. These collections build out our lounge offering and continue to bring versatility across our men's assortment. Guest response has been very strong, and we are chasing into additional inventory for these 2 new hit franchises. Following the holidays, our stores and e-commerce sites will have a back-to-gym focus. For men, we'll feature items from our Pace Breaker and License to Train franchises to support our guests as they live into their New Year fitness and well-being resolutions. We're also gearing up to launch men's footwear in the first quarter of 2024, which will be an important moment for Lululemon. We'll have much more to share as our pipeline of innovation continues to generate newness and versatility for our male guests. When looking at men's brand awareness, it remains low, approximately 13% in the U.S., 12% in Australia and single digits everywhere else outside of North America. Building awareness and consideration remains top of mind for us, and we see ample opportunity to increase the media and brand-building commitment to the men's business. An example of this strategy is our recent targeted TV campaign. In quarter 3, we tested TV in the U.S. with a campaign focused on bringing new male guests into the brand and featuring our iconic ABC bottoms. We are encouraged by the early results and the buzz created by this targeted investment, and we plan to continue the campaign next year. In 2024, our marketing calendar has other men's moments planned, such as the footwear launch, and we will continue to leverage ways that paid media can raise our awareness among men who have yet to wear Lululemon. I would also like to mention our accessories business, which continues to perform well. In quarter 3, our bag assortment grew in the strong double digits, and the Everywhere Belt Bag posted solid growth on top of last year's standout performance. I remain excited with our pipeline of innovation for the remainder of quarter 4 and into next year. Our foundational principle remains, when you feel your best, you perform your best. Our teams continue to live into that principle for our technical gear, and we are also leveraging it as we expand our lounge and on-the-move offerings. I'd now like to spend a few minutes and share some of the ways we connect with our local communities in quarter 3. As we've discussed in the past, we continue to lean into our grassroots approach to building community and engaging with guests on a local and one-on-one basis. In addition, we recognized the opportunity to raise unaided awareness and attract new guests through larger scale activations and brand campaigns, both within North America and across our international markets. Let me share a few examples. To bring attention to World Mental Health Day, we released our third annual global well-being report in September. This global survey conducted in 14 markets looks at how people around the world are approaching their physical, mental and social well-being. And while a majority of people say they are making well-being a priority, you feel it is where it should be. To support our guests, we created well-being focused experiences in key markets and a highlight was a one-of-a-kind activation in China that encompass 32 cities and 76 stores. The pinnacle expression took place in Shanghai as we took over the West Bund for an entire week with events and experiences over a 3-kilometer stretch of this popular destination on the waterfront. The results of this activation were phenomenal and included more than 1,600 pieces of press coverage with 3 billion impressions, significant engagement on social media and approximately 12,000 guests participating in person. This event was a very unique and compelling way to drive unaided brand awareness in the market. Also in October to support and help launch our new partnership with Peloton, we hosted a 3-day experience at our Lincoln Park store in Chicago. More than 2,000 guests joined us and it was exciting to see our local Lululemon community come together with the Peloton community to celebrate our new relationship. The success of this event represents the potential of the partnership to leverage the strength of both our highly engaged communities. As you can see, we are taking multiple paths to building brand awareness and consideration across our global markets. Quarter 3 was a terrific example of this strategy, and you can expect more of this type of marketing execution from us going forward. Shifting now to our regional performance. We continue to see solid results across markets with revenue in North America growing 12% and international increasing 49%. We remain pleased with our business in North America, which is in line with our Power of Three x2 targets despite the dynamic operating environment. The quarter began strong as guests responded well to our back-to-school product innovations and our strategies to connect with younger guests through dedicated digital marketing and targeted activations and our market share gains continued. In quarter 3 2023, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue compared to the same period last year. Over the same time period, Lululemon gained 1.5 points of market share in the U.S. with gains in both men's and women's according to Circana's consumer tracking service. North America remains a significant and compelling opportunity for Lululemon. With unaided awareness of only 25%, we have several ways to bring new guests into the brand, including ongoing innovation within our product assortment, new store openings and optimizations and our unique approach toward connection encompassing both local activation and larger-scale marketing campaigns. Switching now to international. We remain excited and optimistic regarding the potential for the Lululemon brand. In quarter 3, all regions grew in strong double digits, including a 53% increase in Greater China. While we are keeping a close eye on the macro environment in China, our business remains strong. We believe several factors benefit us in this important market, including our relatively small size with room to grow beyond our 114 stores in Mainland China at the end of the quarter, the localized nature of our brand as we leverage our relationships with local fitness studios, instructors and influencers and our local and community-based events. We are excited with the brand acceptance we're seeing globally as we continue to execute against our plan to quadruple our international business from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. And with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our updated guidance. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. We continue to be pleased with our performance across channel, geography and merchandise category. Despite an uncertain macro backdrop, our teams are executing at a high level, which contributed to our upside in Q3. As Calvin mentioned, we're happy with our start to the holiday season, but with nearly 2/3 of the quarter still in front of us, we remain prudent in our planning. Let me now share the details of our Q3 performance. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q3 2023 with Q3 2022, adjusted earnings per share for Q3 2023 excludes $72.1 million of after-tax expense related to the impairment and restructuring costs associated with the Lululemon Studio business. I'll provide more detail on these charges shortly, and you can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-Q for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q3, total net revenue rose 19% to $2.2 billion. Comparable sales increased 14% with a 9% increase in stores and a 19% increase in digital. In our store channel, sales increased 19%. We ended the quarter with a total of 686 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 17% versus last year, driven by the addition of 63 net new Lululemon stores since Q3 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 14 net new stores and completed 8 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues totaled $908.1 million or 41% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 12% versus last year. Within International, we saw a 49% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 53%. By category, women's revenue increased 19% versus last year, men's increased 15% and accessories grew 29%. It's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across channels, with stores up nearly 25% and e-commerce increasing 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni-operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $1.28 billion, or 58.1% of net revenue compared to 55.9% of net revenue in Q3 2022. The adjusted gross profit rate in Q3 increased 220 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 250 basis point increase in overall product margin driven primarily by lower freight costs as well as lower air freight usage. Fixed costs deleveraged 20 basis points in the quarter. We also saw 10 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $843 million or 38.2% of net revenue compared to 36.8% of net revenue for the same period last year. We achieved better-than-expected deleverage in the quarter, while at the same time continuing to invest behind our strategic initiatives to build brand awareness among additional investments we've accelerated to fuel our Power of Three x2 road map. Foreign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $436 million or 19.8% of net revenue, an increase of 80 basis points compared to Q3 2022. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $125.3 million or 28.1% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 27.6% a year ago. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $320.8 million or $2.53 per diluted share compared to $2 for the third quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $163 million for the quarter compared to approximately $176 million for the third quarter last year. The spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology and supply chain investments. Before turning to our balance sheet highlights, let me spend a moment on the charges we took related to the Lululemon Studio business. As you know, in September, we announced a new 5-year partnership with Peloton. Under this arrangement, Peloton has become the exclusive digital fitness content provider for Lululemon Studio, and we have become Peloton's primary apparel provider. In addition, while we will still provide service and support to owners of the Lululemon Studio Mirror Device, we've recently stopped selling the hardware. As we will no longer be producing content or selling Mirror hardware, we recognized a post-tax asset impairment and other charges related to Lululemon Studio, totaling $72.1 million during the third quarter. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory was $1.66 billion at the end of Q3, down 4% versus last year and lower than our guidance. The lower inventory relative to our guidance relates predominantly to higher revenue, the provision we took against our remaining Lululemon Studio hardware inventory, timing of certain receipts and foreign exchange. On a unit basis, inventory increased approximately 5%. We remain comfortable with both the quality and quantity of our inventory. At the end of Q4, we expect inventory on a dollar basis to be flat to down slightly versus last year, with units flat to up slightly. We repurchased approximately 553,000 shares at an average price of $381. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $243 million remaining on our prior repurchase program. In addition, as Calvin mentioned, our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $1 billion plan. We remain optimistic in our outlook for the business and continue to use share repurchases as our preferred method to return cash to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of our shares. Let me shift now to our guidance outlook. As I mentioned, we're pleased with the trends we've seen at the start of the holiday season. That being said, the majority of the quarter remains in front of us. We remain aware of the uncertainties in the macro environment, and we continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios. So let me begin with Q4. We expect revenue in the range of $3.135 billion to $3.170 billion, representing growth of 13% to 14%. We expect to open approximately 25 net new company-operated stores in Q4. We expect gross margin in Q4 to increase 90 to 120 basis points relative to Q4 of 2022. This will be driven by lower freight expense and regional mix, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation. In Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 160 to 190 basis points relative to Q4 2022. This deleverage continues to reflect our strategic decision to invest in growth initiatives, including those to grow brand awareness globally. When looking at operating margin for Q4, we expect approximately 70 basis points of contraction relative to last year. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.93 versus adjusted EPS of $4.40 a year ago. Shifting to full year 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.549 billion to $9.584 billion. This range represents growth of 18% relative to 2022 and exceeds the revenue target in our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open approximately 55 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 to 30 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low to mid-teens. Our new store openings in 2023, will include approximately 35 stores in our international markets, with the majority of these planned for China. For the full year, we continue to forecast adjusted gross margin to increase between 190 to 210 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 220 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We now forecast deleverage of 120 to 140 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has enabled us to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually. When looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, we now expect it to increase approximately 70 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. For Q4, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2023, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.34 to $12.42 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Our range of $670 million to $690 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%. With that, I will turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. As you can see, Lululemon had another strong quarter, and we are energized about the many opportunities ahead. We are pleased with the strength and resilience of our brand across markets, channels and categories, and are well positioned to deliver against our Power of Three x2 growth strategy. In addition, we are happy with the start to the holiday season, and our teams are ready to deliver for our guests in quarter 4. And I want to mention that as we have demonstrated over recent years, we are actively planning the business so that we respond to any changes in guest behavior that could occur related to the dynamic macro environment. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our people across the Lululemon, who make these consistently strong results possible as we deliver for our guests and build towards the future. With that, we can now take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Perfect. My question was actually on the remodeled locations with the co-locations within them. I was wondering if there are any metrics you can share on how those stores perform compared to the legacy fleet? Then also, if you have any update on how much of the fleet is in that format now in North America and if all the new locations are in that format? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Alex. We've got about 150 stores co-located. Our plans this year have ticked up slightly to 25 to 30 co-located remodels, up from 25. These are stores where we have very high traffic and sales productivity and see an opportunity to capitalize on that traffic and drive incremental volume. We tend to look over a 2- to 3-year time horizon in terms of maturation of store, and we will see a slightly lower sales productivity from those boxes, but very strong returns and healthy sales per square foot. And so pleased overall with that strategy. And you'll continue to see more of that from us. We are much further along on that in North America, and that strategy is still largely in front of us in our international business. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Rakesh Patel : Just had a question on what's implied with fourth quarter guidance. So I'm just hoping if you can provide some guardrails on how we should think about stores versus direct and North America versus international? I'm curious which segments may have a different trend versus the growth that you've seen year-to-date? Meghan Frank : Yes. Rick, so in terms of Q4 guidance, we're guiding at 13% to 14% growth. As Calvin mentioned, very pleased with the Thanksgiving weekend, still have about 2/3 of the quarter in front of us, so being prudent in our planning there. We haven't broken down specifics, but what I'd share is very strong continued double-digit growth in international and then on North America, high single digits. Operator : The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I wanted to follow up on the prior question. The high single-digit North America sales guidance is below your typical algorithm [indiscernible] guidance. Can you talk to what you're seeing in the business or hearing from your customer that's informing this posture? Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Lorraine. Yes, I would say coming off of a strong Q3 performance, we did experience some very strong performance during our Cyber Five period. We are mindful of the macroeconomic environment as we move into the balance of Q4 and still with 2/3 of the quarter in front of us, being mindful of the pressures out there and contemplating that and how we are guiding. We are also planning the business for multiple scenarios to be able to capitalize on any potential upside. Operator : The next question is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Calvin, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the consumer behavior with the brand. You've talked a little bit about being mindful about the macro backdrop a few times. But has there been any shift in consumer behavior conversion or engagement with the brand that shifted relative to what you saw 90 days ago? Meghan Frank : Brooke, in terms of guest metrics, we're still seeing growth in both spend from new and existing guests. So still really pleased, I would say, overall, and just looking out over Q4, again, 2/3 of the quarter in front of us, so planning the business prudently. But I would say, overall, really pleased with what we're seeing in terms of guest behavior. Calvin McDonald : The only one I'd add, Brooke, relative to when we look at the overall market is, as I mentioned, in the men's business. And that is our business internationally remains very strong, our growth well above industry average and putting on share in North America. But when we look at the macro category within North America, we do see that he is spending less in apparel in general. We continue to put on market share. But if I was to point to just one trend that we're observing and monitoring, it is that guest behavior that we're seeing in a macro condition. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats on another nice quarter. So maybe, Calvin, could you just elaborate on the cadence of business that you saw as the third quarter progressed in North America? Maybe if you could speak to stores versus digital. And where do you see the largest market share opportunities next year across the assortment? And then Meghan, any constraints to modest operating margin expansion on the mid-teens revenue growth multi-year? Or are there just -- are there any geography considerations on the margin front as we think about gross margin relative to SG&A beyond this year that we should be thinking about? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Matt. I'll talk about sort of just the trends through the quarter and then share gains, and then I'll let Meghan pick up the other part of it. I think you snuck in 5 or 6 questions there, but let's take our time. We have a little bit of -- we have some time here, Matt. But on the quarter, we dropped some new innovation to begin in August, and had some targeted campaigns, both digitally, some activations around back-to-school and the guests, both in our female and male guests responding incredibly well to that and the newness. I would say that momentum moderated a little bit in September and then accelerated again in October when once again, some newness and innovation was dropped with Wundermost. We activated with our men's campaign around the ABC franchise targeted for top-of-funnel guest acquisition. So it definitely sort of progressed through the quarter like that healthy across but with the peak sort of being in August and October and driven by either newness and our campaign to activate and go after unaided awareness. When I think of share next year, our plans are still very much reflective of the being early innings across our business. We do expect to see our men's business continue to be strong and put on share at unaided awareness below 25%. It's 13%, in fact, in North America. We're going to continue to put on share across all of our categories and playing to our strengths in bottoms and some of our core franchises and the new franchises like Soft Jersey and Steady State, which is really resonating. We're chasing into that inventory, and we're seeing both our existing guests and new guests come in through that franchise. And then with women's and accessories, similar story. We have a lot of runway and opportunity in our bottoms business as well as tops and accessories. So there's not a specific category that we think will drive share but a very balanced approach and performance as we've experienced and really pointed to the fact that we're in early innings of growth across all of those categories in both genders. Meghan Frank : And then in terms of operating margin expansion, so we're up 70 basis points -- our guide of 70 basis points above 2022 on an annual basis. So we're really pleased with our performance this year, which is above our target. We remain committed to our target. We still see opportunities with scale of business and efficiencies in our cost structure, e-com penetration is a benefit to us. And then air freight that we've largely recovered the air freight spend. We still have about 20 basis points above 2019 levels. So obviously, we'll share more on '24 as we close out the year, but still remain comfortable with our long-term posture there. Operator : The next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Let me add my congratulations to the stores, look great, and I love the [indiscernible]. Calvin, so my question for you is on the Power of Three x2, the portion that is 4x international. Obviously, we see the strength in China. Just wondering what role does Europe play in that? And is there a time when we'll hear from you a little bit more aggressive rollout in Europe? And then my second one is pretty quick. Meghan, just remind us of the timing of the gross margin pressure last year. I think it was post Christmas that we start to see some liquidation activity. And does that remain sort of an opportunity as we get to the latter part of the quarter? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Adrienne. In terms of our international growth and the markets that -- regions that will contribute to the quadruple, it really is balanced across all. Clearly, China has emerged as the significant region outside of North America. But every market we're in within APAC and within EMEA is growing double digit, contributing to growth and has single-digit unaided brand awareness. So I believe every market will continue to contribute next year. We are leaning in on certain markets, continue to lean on China to accelerate that growth potential. As you know, we've opened up some markets in EMEA. We'll continue to invest behind those. As Meghan mentioned, see co-located opportunities in some of our key markets as we go back and reinvest and open stores, the ones we've done that in, be it [indiscernible] performed incredibly well. We see some opportunities in London to bring that co-located strategy to some of our proven doors there. We're seeing success both locally and with tourism and then in the APAC market. We've opened up Thailand, but all of our key markets. Australia is an interesting one where a few years ago, we prioritized and leaned in with an optimization strategy and seeing significant benefits and gains from that and what had been our most mature international market. We've opened up a new DC that allowed us to service better, service the stores. We've optimized a number of our doors there. They're performing incredibly well and very pleased. So it really shows our ability to keep growing in our most mature but still very underdeveloped. And growth is coming from every market we're in, in the double digit, and we'll continue '24 and beyond and contribute to that quadrupling. Meghan Frank : And then in terms of margin and markdowns, yes, you're correct. It was those peak Christmas week where we started to see guest behavior gravitate towards -- more towards markdown sales and more towards the more highly discounted goods that we're offering with similar in penetration to 2019. We were comparing to Q4 of 2021, which was a low point in terms of markdown rate. So in the end, Q4 was just slightly above 2019. At this point in time, just given we've got about 2/3 of the quarter in front of us, we are guiding to 90 to 120 basis points of gross margin expansion and markdowns essentially in line with last year as part of that, being mindful of the proportion of the quarter that's still ahead. Operator : The next question is from Abbie Zvejnieks with Piper Sandler. Abigail Zvejnieks : Great. Just 2 questions for me to follow up on the previous question on gross margins. Just -- was there any strategy for Black Friday or maybe being a little bit more visible for that shopping occasion and shifting some of those promotions maybe more towards the Black Friday period versus those Christmas weeks last year? And then secondly, can you just talk about your inventory management, I think that was a little bit better than expected and how you got there? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Abbie. I'll take the first part. We did pull some volume forward on Black Friday, making it available in early access to our central members. It was an initiative to have a membership of reward benefit. Exciting behind that was we saw a significant increase in app downloads, which was the way in which members needed to be able to access that and obviously did that at no incremental cost. So I think over 250,000 app downloads into that membership base. So it was a benefit of reward. We pulled some volume forward, which allowed our infrastructure and DCs to manage very well through the weekend. But in terms of other than that initiative, you would have seen on our sites, the similar language, not calling out sale. You would have seen in our stores, no signage, traditional merchandising, full price product at the front of the store. I thought the stores look fantastic. The Winter Whites and the newness in the product really punched through, and we saw some very nice balance sales, as I alluded to, in terms of regular price and our markdown. And markdowns were at the back traditionally done, really didn't deploy anything more and happy with how the guests responded to both options and through the entire Cyber Five weekend. Meghan Frank : And then in terms of inventory management, so we ended the quarter down 4% in inventory, and it was lower than our expectation of high single to low double-digit increase. That was driven by higher sales, the studio inventory write-off, some timing on receipts as well as FX. Important to keep in mind, we still have opportunity in our inventory turns relative to 2019. That is our goal over the longer term. And then looking at our inventory CAGR relative to 2019 versus our sales, we're relatively in line at the end of the quarter. Our expectation at the end of Q4 will be inventory balance flat to slightly down on a cost basis and then flat to slightly up on a unit basis, again, still opportunity from [indiscernible] perspective, and we feel pleased with the level and currency of the inventory, both at the end of Q3 and then at the end of Q4 as well. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about store comps, how it shook out from a traffic versus ticket perspective and I guess the same question for e-com. And then I'm curious if you can share any early thoughts on store growth for '24 specifically, how are you thinking about China? Meghan Frank : Paul, so in terms of KPIs in stores and e-com, we saw similar to the start of the year, very strong traffic performance, so up 20% plus in both channels. With that traffic, we're still pleased with the absolute conversion but seeing a little bit of a comp decrease in terms of conversion and then relatively stable basket size. We haven't shared any specifics. Obviously, we'll do that at the end of the quarter in terms of store growth for '24, but we remain committed overall to our store growth target in the low double digits. Paul Lejuez : Can you talk about in-store productivity in China in this year's [indiscernible]? Calvin McDonald : The stores in China continue to exceed [indiscernible] as we open. So we're pleased with both the new stores we're opening. They are beating pro forma, both on a total revenue perspective, obviously, on a dollar per square foot, and that's across Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, which we continue to test into. We went back and optimized and continue to see opportunity, as Meghan alluded to, predominantly in Shanghai and Beijing to go back in and start optimizing and collating some of our locations. We did our Kerry Center store in Shanghai, and the results have been very, very strong. So we know that our business there is growing. And in a lot of these locations, we've hit that productivity level where it's time to go back and invest and expand the assortment and continue to drive the overall results in those stores. But the openings of these new stores continue to sort of exceed and beat plan, which is very encouraging and excited to see the ability to go back and optimize some of the locations. Operator : The next question is from [indiscernible] with Evercore ISI. Unknown Analyst : Congrats on a great quarter. I just want to go back, I know you spoke to North America high single digits in the fourth quarter. I know you said that -- Calvin, you later mentioned that trends are accelerating nicely with some newness in October. I guess [indiscernible] that the fourth quarter deceleration baked into the guidance is maybe just being prudent against the macro you're seeing here. But it's a little bit below the Power of Three algorithm that you gave us. Is there any reason that North America wouldn't be at that low double-digit algorithm you gave us in 2024. Is it conservative and contained to the fourth quarter? And then I'm curious if there's anything you're seeing in the business today on the competitive set to inform you as to whether you may or may not see the consumer break towards some of those value purchases that you saw right before the holiday last year? Meghan Frank : Thanks. So right at this point in time, we're guiding to 13% to 14% for Q4. I'm just being mindful of the proportion of the quarter that's in front of us. We were really pleased with our Q3 performance in North America despite some macro challenges in North American market, still picking up share, still growing at 12%, so in line with Power of Three x2 target. We remain committed to that, I would say, for the year and as we move forward and managing from a portfolio approach perspective, any near-term pressures, but I think appropriate and prudent, given where we are in the quarter at this point. Calvin McDonald : And I'll just chat a little bit about the competitiveness and the guest behavior. We have not seen a dramatic shift as it relates to our product and our assortment. I've mentioned the men's behavior from a macro perspective within the category within North America. But within our assortment, our guests, we continue to see very healthy full price, continue to see very healthy reaction to newness and innovation. I think those are both very positive signs that indicate if the guest is trading down to value, they are equally trading up or holding onto purchases that I think play to the strength of our product, which is versatility, quality and innovation. When you purchase our product, you get multiple wear occasions, multiple uses out of it. That's the versatility and the quality and the innovation behind it and still is resonating. And he and she is still responding very well to the newness that we drop, be it the new franchises in men's, which we're chasing into far exceeded our expectations, launch of new initiatives like Wundermost or just how we are assembling and bringing product of our core, be it through our Winter Whites or other initiatives, responding very well. So encouraged, we'll continue to monitor and be agile, but not seeing a behavioral shift within our assortment mix with our guests. Operator : The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Dana Telsey : When you think about the market share and obviously, your market share opportunities, Calvin and you're continuing to gain market share, are there new players who you see that you're taking market share from and that you see opportunity moving forward? And then is there a different market share opportunities in different areas of the world that you see? And then just lastly, when you think about categories and outerwear, which has been a focus, how is that category performing and how is it contributing to AUR? Calvin McDonald : All right. Thanks, Dana. In terms of market share gains, by the very nature of where we are in our product innovation and creation and unneeded awareness, we really do continue to grow across both men's and women's across all categories in all markets, including North America and especially internationally. Now market share data internationally in certain markets, it's harder to get than in North America, but our growth when we compare it to other peers that report, we know is definitely above and therefore, putting on both through our guest acquisition market share gains. So feel very encouraged by that continuation, the balanced nature of we're growing market share. A couple of call-outs. I don't see any shift in change within men's and women's and the core strengths that the brand has, be it bottoms and in our performance activities. And there are a lot of categories, as you mentioned, where we have below market share when I compare some of those strengths to us. Accessories is one good example. It's a $110 billion global category. We have less than 1% share. And what we're proving and continuing to see through newness and innovation is it's more than just the Everywhere Belt Bag. That is a core item that is resonated, has and continues to perform incredibly well for us. But we're building out a very solid bag business with a lot of opportunity of growth moving forward. And we think other players have 2% to 3% in that category. So we see that as being a nice contributor and driver of growth. And our other categories, be it lounge. And you mentioned outerwear, we have a very sizable outerwear business as we look across all, not just cold weather, but activity based, rain. We don't report the category specifically, but if we were to, we are a significant player in outerwear and see a lot of opportunity to continue to develop into those across the performance needs of our guests, rain as an opportunity and then building upon our growing credibility and success in cold weather with the Wunder Puff, which we're seeing very good success internationally, in China in particular right now. I'm very pleased how we're set up in North America with success. And obviously, climate has been slightly different, but we're not pointing to that and we're excited where we see opportunity to grow that business. So outerwear will be another key growth driver for us [indiscernible] but look to the core to continue to grow, continue to put our market share. Operator, We'll take one more question. Operator : The next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : I just have a 2-part question. First, you touched on competition, but just in Q3 and over the Black Friday holiday, how does the competitive landscape impact your approach to pricing and promotions [indiscernible] Calvin, if you could give us a little bit of a -- little deeper dive on footwear, what you see in the women's footwear business, what gives you confidence to launch the men's footwear business, that would be super helpful. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Jay. In terms of competitiveness in the marketplace, what I saw was a lot of discounting. I saw a lot of discounting early. I saw deeper discounts. And I saw some early and young players in this space discount consistently in days, weeks leading into and over the Cyber Five weekend. That's what I observed. We didn't change our approach or strategy, as I mentioned. We didn't use sale language. We led with an early access, which had great value in the downloads of the app, which we know delivers a much greater value with our guests. We're excited to be able to use a benefit to drive that strategy within our essential membership base. And we continue to sell and see very good regular price sales. So I definitely saw a more dynamic promotionally driven environment by some of our peers, by some of the new entries into this category. We didn't deviate. We didn't change. And our results I talked to, I was very pleased with and indicated we didn't need to. Guest still responds to innovative products and that's what our pipeline is full. It's what we continue to deliver, and we'll continue to drive our growth into the oncoming quarters and through our Power of Three x2 strategy. And then relative to footwear, we're early and we're pleased where we are in our footwear journey. It's a small category for us, especially in our Power of Three x2 growth plan in terms of the role that it plays in our growth targets. I'm glad we're in footwear. I'm excited with what we're learning and how we're seeing and some of the early successes as we continue to test and learn. We updated Blissfeel and Chargefeel this year. We continue to see success with our Restfeel across both men's and women's. We're trying an [indiscernible] on Restfeel in additional locations, seeing great response this holiday period. So we continue to be excited about footwear and the newness that the team has in the category that we'll be bringing forward and our current plans are to launch men's in quarter 1 of 2024. We'll continue to test and learn. But we're seeing enough positive signals in response from the guests that we have an opportunity in this category, and we're going to take a long-term view and build it, but excited about what we're seeing so far. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying report on Form 10-K are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the fourth quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our Q4 and full year 2023 results, which represent another solid finish to another strong year for lululemon. We will also discuss our business in Q1 and our outlook for 2024. As you've heard from others in our industry, there has been a shift in the U.S. consumer behavior of late, and we're navigating what has been a slower start to the year in this market. We view this as an opportunity to keep playing offense as we lean into investments that will continue our growth trajectory. Outside the U.S., our business remains strong in all our international markets in Canada. Meghan will take you through our guidance shortly, and I will share with you some of the initiatives that we have planned specifically for the U.S. as well as our overall plans for product and marketing. What you'll hear from me is a message that remains consistent. We have an impressive pipeline of innovation. Our opportunity to increase our brand awareness remains significant. And we will continue to grow and optimize our store base within the Americas and around the world. And we remain ahead of our Power of Three x2 goals. So let's begin. As you read in our press release, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, exceeded the updated guidance we provided in January. Our growth remained balanced across channels, regions and product categories. And we continue to see strong increase in traffic at our stores and e-commerce sites. In the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 16%. By region, the Americas increased 9%, China Mainland increased 78%, and the rest of the world increased 36%. By merchandise category, women's increased 13%, men's grew 15% and accessories increased 40%. And earnings per share were $5.29 versus adjusted EPS of $4.40 in Q4 last year. When looking at our product performance in Q4, the trends we have seen in the business over the last several quarters continued. We saw strength in key franchises, including, for women : Scuba, Define, Softstreme and Wunder Puff. For men : Steady State, Soft Jersey and ABC as well as License to Train and Pace Breaker. And in accessories, our overall bag assortment continues to perform well. And we continue to build our Essentials membership program in North America, which has now grown to more than 17 million members in the first year. This quarter, we offered them exclusive benefits, including early access to our Black Friday styles, member-only shop nights and invitations to participate in experiences such as our Move for You activation with Peloton at the Mall of America. We remain excited with our membership program as it offers us new ways to engage with our guests and increase both spend and LTV. I'm pleased that we're seeing positive results so far on all of these objectives. Now turning to our full year 2023 results. Revenue increased 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion, with the Americas, up 12%; China Mainland, up 67%; and Rest of World growing 43% versus last year. Adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points while adjusted earnings per share increased 27% versus 2022. As you know, 2023 was the second full year of our Power of Three x2 growth plan. When looking at these 2 years collectively, I'm pleased that we have grown revenue at a 24% CAGR, fueled by a 44% CAGR in our international regions, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grown adjusted EPS at a 28% CAGR and continued to gain market share. These results speak to the strength of the lululemon brand in all markets where we operate and illustrate the significant opportunities we have in front of us as we remain in the early innings of our growth story. Let me now speak to quarter 1 of 2024 and what we're seeing in the business. We are pleased that our sales remain strong in most regions across the globe. Consistent with what we've seen from others in the market, the consumer environment in the United States has been somewhat challenging. However, despite the market dynamics, we remain optimistic about our opportunities to grow our business in the U.S. in 2024 and to continue to gain market share. We have robust plans in place to further strengthen our position. We will continue to open and optimize our stores with plans for 5 to 10 new store openings and 15 to 20 optimizations. With U.S. sales per square foot above our overall average of $1,600, our stores remain among the most productive in the industry. In addition, our stores facilitate a direct connection with our guests, help us attract new guests into the brand and act as hubs in our local communities. We will continue to invest into the market to increase our brand awareness as we continue to activate both community-based events and larger brand campaigns. We see other areas within the business to further strengthen our positioning. We are successfully growing our business across all age demographics, including our younger guests. As we have attracted more younger guests into the brand, we have seen strong sell-through of our smaller sizes and our offering of color. We don't yet know how high is high with this demographic, and our teams are chasing into these areas of the assortment so we can better maximize the business. And our product pipeline is compelling, both within the U.S. and across the globe. In fact, 2024 will be another year of significant product innovation. We started the year strong with the launch of our expanded footwear collection in early February. Building on the initial success of our women's line, we hosted a media event in New York City to unveil new styles of both technical and casual footwear, including our first shoes designed for men. Our new styles available for both men and women include the cityverse, designed for all-day comfort and bringing the best of technical performance to a casual sneaker; beyondfeel, a new running shoe that offers superior cushioning, ventilation and support; and beyondfeel trail, our newest road to trail running shoe. We are very pleased with the initial reaction to our new styles. We were seeing a particularly strong response to cityverse from our male guests in North America and in China, and the guest response is exceeding our expectations. Our teams are chasing into this initial strength, and we'll build upon this momentum with additional footwear innovations planned throughout the year. Our strategy with footwear is the same as apparel. We lead with technical innovations that solve for the unmet needs of our guests. We can then leverage our expertise in raw material innovation and technical construction to offer versatile styles designed for everyday use. In addition, within our 2024 product pipeline, we will continue to be a leader in fabric innovation with new fabrics planned within both our yoga and train categories. Also for women, we will continue to maximize our largest franchise, Align, as we explore new silhouettes across both tops and bottoms. And we will continue to expand our popular train franchise, License to Train. On the men's side, this year, we are launching the most innovation I've seen in the last number of years across categories and activities. A few highlights include new fabric innovations within our golf category and continuing to build upon the success of soft jersey with additional styles. Also, we have recently leveraged our iconic Pace Breaker into a complete collection with the launch of a Pace Breaker jacket and pad to bring new solves into the men's run category. Our product and our ability to bring new technical solutions into our assortment on a consistent basis is one of our biggest competitive advantages. I'm excited with the innovations we have on top for 2024, which will continue to enable our guests to sweat in any way they choose. Let me now shift to our brand and marketing strategies. As you know, our brand awareness remains low across most markets, which represents a significant opportunity for us to attract new guests. Starting with our FURTHER event, which began just before International Women's Day and concluded last week. FURTHER was a first-of-its-kind women's ultramarathon in which 10 athletes from our ambassador collective set out to run the furthest distances of their careers. The activation was a huge success as world records were set by athletes wearing our apparel and footwear and is a great example of what makes lululemon unique. For example, how we create authentic community activations like no other brand, which result in increased brand awareness through significant earned and social media attention and also how we continue to innovate with athletes and for athletes and introduce new technical solutions into our assortment. As part of FURTHER, we designed 36 products through a female-first lens, many of which we will introduce into our mainline assortment over the coming seasons. Looking forward, next month in advance of the Paris Olympics and Paralympic Games, we'll be revealing our kit for Team Canada. As you know, in 2021, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee. After our inaugural 2022 Winter Games, we're now set to launch our first Team Canada summer collection, outfitting the athletes and coaches with our product. I've seen what we've created, and it's amazing for both our Olympians and Paralympians. In addition to supporting Canadian athletes, this partnership is another example of lululemon's deep relationships with elite athletes. It showcases our brand on the global stage and is a compelling strategy to grow awareness and bring new guests into the brand. I'd like to spend a moment on the success and growth within our international business. We experienced strength across all of our international markets in Q4, and we expect business to remain robust in 2024. International, which includes our China Mainland and Rest of World segments, continues to be underpenetrated and represents only 21% of our business. We operate a total of 273 stores in all of our international markets combined, which clearly speaks to the opportunity we have ahead of us. In 2024, we'll open approximately 30 stores outside of North America, and we will continue with our strategies to increase our brand awareness. And while not part of the Power of Three x2 growth plan, over the long term, we expect international to represent approximately half of our overall revenue. As you can see, we have many reasons to be optimistic about the future. We entered 2024 from a position of strength. We exceeded our Power of Three x2 revenue target in 2023. And based upon our guidance, we will remain ahead of schedule in 2024. We are excited that our strategies to build brand awareness are working. Over the past year through our strategic investments in brand campaigns and community activations, we have successfully grown our unaided awareness in key markets. The U.S. went from 25% to 31%, and China went from 9% to 14%. We will continue these strategies in 2024. And we will continue to strategically invest across all markets, including the U.S., which will set us up well for this year and beyond. Given we are in the early innings of our growth with low unaided awareness and significant market share potential, all of us on the lululemon leadership team are tremendously excited for what lies ahead for our brand. We are investing for growth with a pipeline of innovation that is full. We are playing offense while many others in our sector are not. And these advantages will further enhance our standing in the marketplace in the U.S. and around the globe. With that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our 2024 guidance. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. We closed out 2023 on a strong note, with our Q4 results exceeding the updated guidance we provided in mid-January. As Calvin mentioned, we've seen a slower start to Q1 in the U.S. while we continue to see strength in all other regions. While we navigate the consumer environment in the U.S., we see several opportunities to maximize our performance. Our teams are focused on executing against our strategies and delivering for our guests throughout 2024. As we have always done, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios. We are positioning ourselves to both maximize our performance in the short and long term and manage our business to protect against downside. Before sharing the details of our Q4 performance and our guidance outlook, let me provide an update on our segment reporting. With the evolution of our business, the meaningful opportunity we have in our international regions and our omnichannel operating model, we've changed our reporting segments from channel to geography. In our 2023 10-K, you will see our new segments, which are Americas, China Mainland and Rest of World. In the earnings release and on today's call, we will still provide comparable sales metrics by channel so you'll have the data to close out your models for 2023. However, going forward, we'll be reporting revenue metrics and profit on a regional basis. Let me now share the details of our Q4 performance. For Q4, total net revenue rose 16% to $3.2 billion, and comparable sales increased 12%. Within our regions, results were as follows : Americas revenue increased 9%, with comparable sales increasing 7%. China Mainland revenue increased 78%, with comparable sales increasing 60%. And in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 36%, with comparable sales increasing by 31%. In our store channel, total sales increased 15%, with comparable store sales increasing 6%. We ended the quarter with a total of 711 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 15% versus last year, driven by the addition of 56 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 25 net new stores and completed 15 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 17% and contributed $1.7 billion of top line or 52% of total revenue. By category, women's revenue increased by 13% versus last year, men's increased by 15%, and accessories grew 40%. We also experienced ongoing strength in traffic across channels, with stores and e-commerce both increasing by approximately 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion or 59.4% of net revenue compared to the adjusted rate of 57.4% of net revenue in Q4 2022. Our adjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points relative to last year and was driven primarily by the following : a 210 basis point increase in overall product margin, driven primarily by lower air and ocean freight costs as well as lower airfreight usage, offset slightly by 10 basis points of deleverage on foreign exchange. Markdowns in Q4 were relatively flat with last year. Gross margin was favorable to our updated guidance of 120 to 130 basis points, driven predominantly by 40 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, 20 basis points of favorability in product margin driven mostly by lower freight costs and 10 basis points of favorability in FX. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $990 million or 30.9% of net revenue compared to 29% of net revenue for the same period last year. The deleverage in SG&A was driven by our continued strategic investments in brand building, technology and foundational infrastructure, in addition to increased depreciation and amortization related to investments made in 2022 and 2023. This was partially offset by savings related to the evolution of our lululemon Studio business model. Foreign exchange contributed 40 basis points to the deleverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $914 million or 28.5% of net revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 28.3% in Q4 2022. Tax expense for the quarter was $262 million or 28.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.7% a year ago. The decrease relative to last year is due primarily to an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and some favorable adjustments upon the filing of income tax returns. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued withholding tax on earnings in Canada. Net income for the quarter was $669 million or $5.29 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.40 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $207 million for the quarter, flat with Q4 last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $2.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.3 billion. We are pleased with our inventory levels, which declined 9% versus last year. Relative to our expectations, higher revenue and foreign exchange contributed to the decrease. On a unit basis, inventory increased approximately 1%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 120,000 shares at an average price of $450. In the full year 2023, we repurchased approximately $550 million of stock at an average price of approximately $375. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $1.2 billion of capacity remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Let me now shift to our guidance outlook. As I said at the start of my remarks, we're being disciplined and agile with our planning for 2024. Our teams are focused on maximizing our performance in the current environment and delivering for our guests this year and beyond. We remain committed to our Power of Three x2 growth plan. Beginning with the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. This range represents growth of 11% to 12% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 10% to 11%. We expect to open 35 to 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024 and complete approximately 40 co-located optimizations. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2024 will include 5 to 10 stores in the Americas, with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland. For the full year, we forecast gross margin to be approximately flat with adjusted gross margin in 2023. Within gross margin, we expect both markdowns and airfreight to be relatively flat with last year. Turning now to SG&A for the full year. We forecast leverage of approximately 10 basis points versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our Power of Three x2 road map, including investments in marketing and brand building aimed at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. When looking at operating margin for the full year of 2024, we expect it to increase by approximately 10 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. To date, in our Power of Three x2 plan, we are tracking above our operating margin target of modest expansion annually. For the full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2023 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.7%. The increase relative to last year relates primarily to lower stock-based compensation deductions and the favorable adjustments we realized when filing our tax returns in 2023. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be 29% to 29.5%. For the fiscal year 2024, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14 to $14.20 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. When looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to decline in the high single to low double-digit percent in the first half of the year and then increase in the second half of the year as we anniversary last year's declines. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. This spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Shifting now to Q1. We expect revenue in the range of $2.175 billion to $2.2 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. We expect to open one net new company-operated store in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to be approximately flat with Q1 2023, with markdowns relatively flat with last year. In Q1, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 130 to 140 basis points relative to Q1 2023. This will be driven predominantly by increased investments to grow brand awareness and acquire new guests and higher depreciation resulting from technology investments made in 2022 and 2023. Let me share some additional details on our investments to grow brand awareness. Within Q1, we will be activating 3 relatively large brand events : our footwear launch and Further ultra marathon, which already took place and our Team Canada kit launch later in the quarter. These events, plus some other strategic investments in brand building, are contributing to the deleverage. Looking at quarters 2 through 4, we do not anticipate SG&A deleverage. And as I previously stated, we expect 10 basis points of SG&A leverage for the full year. When looking at operating margin for Q1, we expect it to decline 130 to 140 basis points year-over-year, driven by our SG&A investments. I'd also note that operating margin in Q1 2023 expanded by 400 basis points, driven predominantly by airfreight savings. In addition, we did not start accelerating our investments into our strategic road map until the second quarter of last year. And as I stated previously, we expect operating margin to expand modestly for the full year on top of the 110 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.40 versus EPS of $2.28 a year ago. And with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Meghan. In summary, I'm proud of how we closed out 2023 and the way in which we have continued to expand around the world, deliver against our Power of Three x2 strategies and create momentum in the business. I'm optimistic that the investments we're making in the business will contribute to another year of growth in 2024. In closing, I want to thank the members of our global collective, particularly our employees in our stores, distribution and guest education centers as well as our store support centers, who engage with our guests every day and bring our brand to life. They are responsible for driving these results, and they will be the engine that will fuel all we will accomplish going forward. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Great. I just wanted to hone in on the comments on the challenging consumer behavior. Just wondering, are you seeing that in some pockets of the business more than others? Or is it broad-based? Is it a traffic or a conversion problem? Or how do you see that? And then does that mean that the business is currently running at the 1Q guide, like that 9% to 10%, I believe? Or how should we think about that comment in relation to the first quarter guidance? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. In terms of what we're seeing, as I mentioned, all international markets, including Canada, are continuing their strong momentum into Q1. And in the U.S. is where we're really navigating the dynamic retail environment with the consumer. That is a little soft coming into the year. I think we have an opportunity. I know we have an opportunity in this market, in particular, some in and around our product. As I mentioned, our sizing, in particular, in 0 to 4 is something we're chasing into. Color, where we had color, it performed well. And honestly, we just did not have enough. And both of these attributes overindexed in the U.S., which is where I see the opportunity, and we're going to continue to play offense in the market. The innovation product pipeline remains very strong for this year, and we have some exciting brand initiatives in addition. Where that's showing up, we're seeing a slowdown in traffic in the U.S., but it's still positive, and conversion is down slightly. And I'd link that to some of the product opportunities we have in the sizing and color, which, as I said, we will -- we are chasing into and get stronger through the quarters. Meghan Frank : Great. And Alex, I'd just add, on the Q1 guide relative to current trends, we don't speak to inter-quarter trends. But as Calvin shared, we were off to a soft start in the U.S., with all other regions performing strongly, and did guide to the 9% to 10% growth, which we feel is appropriate given what we're seeing in terms of trends. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Maikis : I was hoping you could provide a state of the union on the men's business. Growth stabilized after decelerating a bit last year. Where do you see the largest opportunity is to defend and grow share in the men's business? Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Lorraine. As I mentioned, I'm very excited about the product pipeline for men's this year. Last year, our men's business did increase, as you indicated, in the Q4, which was great to see that momentum back into our men's business. Total year was 15% growth. And 2 years into our Power of Three x2 plan, we've grown our men's revenue at a 21% CAGR, so ahead of that goal. We continue to put on share through all of last year. We did see the male guest in general pull back a little bit in the category of apparel and athletic. And I think Q4, we are seeing him being drawn back in on innovation, which I will highlight a few that, for this year, I'm very encouraged by. One is, as you know, in our ABC franchise, both the trouser and 5 pocket, it was only a few years ago that we had one fabric offering, and that was Warpstreme. Since then, we've added Utilitech, we've added WovenAir, and we are launching a VersaTwill product this year, which is -- feels more -- it's a proprietary performance base. So it feels more of a hand feel of a cotton. So it's fantastic for the lighter, warmer months. And it really is a completely incremental offering for us in a silhouette and a brand and a franchise that he loves. Our Lounge product in men's is just getting stronger. We launched Soft Jersey last fall. We've been chasing since then. In the next few weeks, we'll really be fully in an in-stock position to represent. We've added Steady State and Smooth Spacer. So our Lounge offering for him is the strongest it's been. And we've equally launched some performance product that's performing incredibly well : Zeroed In, which is a new train franchise; and the Pace Breaker, which is our most versatile hero short item, bringing that into a track bottom and top to round out the needs for him. So all those are checking very positively. We're seeing very encouraging demand on the newness. And I'm very confident in our product pipeline and what we're going to see. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : I was hoping you could elaborate on what you're seeing in the China market today and your outlook for growth there this year. Additionally, could you provide updated thoughts on opportunity for further profitability improvement in the region this year? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. I'll take the first half. We remain excited about the potential for lululemon in China. In Q4, our revenue increased 78% in Mainland China. Part of that was driven by the COVID-related store closures we experienced in quarter '22. But in the full year, our business grew 67%. So while we're keeping a close eye on the macro environment in the region, our business remains very strong, and we believe several factors benefit us in China. One, we are building from a smaller base. We have 127 stores on Mainland at the end of the quarter, and we see opportunity to continue to add. We have and take a localized approach to our brand, leveraging relationships locally in the community through ambassadors, instructors and influencers that has really resonated locally. And some of our most exciting activations come from that market and an ongoing strategy to keep opening new stores. So our unaided brand awareness, we did see good improvements last year. We started the year at 9%. We ended at 14%. But 14% in a market of that size, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow, see great momentum in the brand and excited about how that team is activating and growing and optimistic with our potential in that market. Meghan Frank : And then, Brooke, I'd add, though we don't break out regional outlooks, in terms of China, we believe that growth rate will be significantly above our guide of 10% to 11% for the full year, excluding the 53rd week. So coming off of a 78% growth in Q4 and feel well positioned as we move into '24. And then in terms of improving profitability in that region, our near-term priority is really to grow top line and capture, as Calvin mentioned, the unaided brand awareness opportunity we see there and go after new guest acquisition this year. So we've looked to continue those investments as we look into '24, but certainly see opportunity over the longer term to continue to grow that operating margin product. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Mark Altschwager : I wanted to ask you about inventory. I guess this is the first time in a while, I think, I've heard you speak to stock-outs in certain sizes and styles perhaps weighing on sales growth. So how do you feel about the level and the mix of your current inventory? What are your plans for inventory growth this year? And given that things seem to be fairly lean, why wouldn't there be an opportunity to perhaps drive lower markdowns in 2024? Maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes you're thinking about there. Meghan Frank : Yes. Thanks, Mark. So inventory, we came in negative 9% on a dollar basis and plus 1 on a unit basis. We feel pleased with the level and currency composition of our inventory overall. Calvin did talk about a few pockets in the U.S. where we feel like we've got an opportunity to accelerate what's working in terms of inventory, but we still feel well positioned from an overall perspective. I would say, from a markdown perspective, we run a very low markdown rate. Generally speaking, 2023 was flat to '22 and 2019, which is a healthy water line for us. That's our expectation for 2024. So at this point in time, given we're very early in the year, we're not changing our thinking on markdowns, but we'll continue to keep updated there. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Could you speak to multiyear drivers of positive comp growth in the Americas maybe relative to the high single digits last year or just areas that you see could take continued market share regardless of the macro? Meghan Frank : Matt, I think the beginning of your question cut off. Do you mind just repeating it? Matthew Boss : Yes, sure. Yes, I think the operator held it on. So what I was asking is on the early innings growth story that I know, Calvin, that you speak to, just how the Americas fits into that? And as we think about same-store sales growth in the Americas relative to the high singles this year, just how best to think about multiyear drivers or areas to take continued market share regardless of what the Americas macro may look like? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Definitely still view across all markets being early innings in our growth story. When we look at Americas, as I mentioned, Canada is continuing its strong momentum into quarter 1. And within the U.S., we're navigating what we see as a dynamic retail environment and a consumer that's a little bit softer. But there are a lot of areas that we are focused on and we know can continue to drive our business, that being product innovation and the unaided awareness, which, in the U.S., is still very low. I think, combined, it's less than 50%, in the 40% range, with a lot of exciting initiatives. Plan to continue to make progress on that awareness metric. So when we look across the metric, when we look across our categories, which I've always talked to before in terms of the balanced approach across men's and women's and accessories in the pipeline and the ability to grow and where we are from an awareness perspective, no change in U.S., no change in our strategy. And with this guidance, not only did we complete '23 ahead of our Power of Three x2 goals, but with the guidance, 2024, we will still be ahead of our Power of Three x2 goals, and we don't see a change in that. Meghan Frank : And Matt, I'd just add, we shared a long-term target of low double-digit CAGR for North America. We're tracking ahead of that to date in our plan. I feel comfortable with that long-term target. And then from a sales per square foot perspective, the U.S. is the highest in terms of sales per square foot by store. So -- and was -- continue to grow when we went through 2023. So we still feel like stores are an important part of that strategy. Matthew Boss : That's great. Meghan, just one follow-up. Could you elaborate, this year, on SG&A, just efficiencies or flexibility in this year's P&L to leverage on the low double-digit revenues? I think, historically, it's mid-teens to see SG&A and operating margin leverage. Meghan Frank : Yes. So we guided for the year to 10 basis points operating margin expansion. We were up against a 110 basis point expansion in 2023. So really pleased with the leverage we saw in 2023. When we looked at our 2024 plans, we've made some reductions to discretionary spend while continuing to invest behind market expansion as well as going after unaided guest awareness and new guest acquisition. So we're really looking at driving into the long-term opportunity there as we also move through 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Dana Telsey : Can you talk a little bit about the marketing investment and how you're thinking about this year compared to last year? And then the membership program, any update on the rollout of the membership program, the profile of the guests that you're seeing and getting? Calvin McDonald : Dana, from a marketing campaign perspective, as we've signaled, we continue to lean in to a variety of activations as a means to get at that unaided brand awareness. Building on the successes that we saw last year, we continue to test and learn. We did an Align campaign beginning of last year, very pleased with the results, followed up with an ABC campaign for him in the fall. Very pleased with that activation. We had a number of activations in Mainland China. All of those are contributing to the growth that we've seen in unaided awareness. So we know that we are acquiring guests, and these top-of-funnel activations are performing. And heading into this year, we have a number that we will continue to innovate and create and bring. So we've kicked off this year already with our cityverse activation, which we were able to leverage quite a bit of earned media behind. That's off to a strong start, as I mentioned, in particular, overindexing with our male guests. FURTHER, which another earned media opportunity supported. Interestingly, with FURTHER is we showcased up to 36 unique innovative items that will, over the next coming months, appear in our lineup for run, with the first being an incredible bra innovation that we'll be launching in Q3. The COC or the Canadian Olympic Committee, which really, we know, from the Beijing Games had a great impact on the brand from a global scale. So there are a lot of exciting activations that we will continue to really gear towards that more top-of-funnel unaided awareness. And as I shared with you, we're seeing success on that. I know we have a long way to go, early innings on what the potential of the brand is in driving unaided into that consideration. Membership program, I mentioned we now have 17 million active members, and that's from really the program was just 1 year -- launched 1 year earlier. So a significant number of our guests, and the program is geared to drive LTV and to drive spend. And we do that through a variety of activations as well as benefits. It can be early access to product. It can be access to some of our events, leveraging our partners, be it physically in local communities or, as we did in January with Peloton, having a back-to-sweat activation. And that is driving engagement, and it's having an impact on the LTV and spend metrics. So we're going to continue in that work. But it's only been less than 1.5 years since we launched it and very encouraged with the results so far and excited to continue building that program. Meghan Frank : And Dana, I'd just add, in terms of marketing investment, our marketing as a percent of sales for 2023 was 4.5. And we're expecting to be in the range of 4.5 to 5 in 2024 and looking forward at this point in time. Operator : The next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : So Calvin, we've seen new entrants in the space. They didn't slow your momentum over the holiday in Q4. But can you talk to the durable competitive advantage that lululemon maintains in terms of materials innovation, scale, the depth of the offering for both men and women? Calvin McDonald : Yes. Thanks, John. I'll break that down into how I view it, which is really 2 components. One is what's fueling the momentum in the business? And obviously, what are the unique strengths or the moat of the brand and how unique are we when we look and compare ourselves to others? So from a momentum perspective, we know that our unique approach to innovating, putting unmet needs of the guests first and delivering the solutions through science of feel, beginning with fabrics, but into fit and overall into performance and then into that product, which then drives the engagement and -- with our community and guest relationships, which then unlocks further unmet needs, is really the momentum driver of this business. And when I look at where we sit in terms of the innovation, the product and the activation with our guests and how they're engaging in any and all activations we do and the relationships with our stores, with our educators, NPS scores, very, very positive, good momentum across all markets when I look at those attributes. And then when I look at what makes lululemon unique, I really stack it and build it across both our model and our brand. And I think the uniqueness is all of these elements combined. Other competitors or brands may have elements of these. But when I look at our model and our product and the consistency of true innovation at the performance level, not at a fashion level, but at a performance level, into our community and the way in which we activate across our partner platform and then through our stores and our ambassadors, the scale in which we're able to do that compared to others. And then combined with our D2C model, where not only do we own the relationship with our guests, but there are inherent benefits of margin structure that allows us to invest other ways in our business to further differentiate. And then into brand, being a dual-gender brand that has permission across wear occasions, from Pinnacle, Podium, Sweat all the way through of Lounge and Social, we believe, is incredibly unique. And we bring that performance perspective to all those needs of the guests and then into the agelessness of the brand, where, if you look -- and I've said before, you go to stores, mom, daughter and grandma can be shopping in the brand and are actually advocates of the brand to the others. And I think that's rooted in the notion of the solutions that we offer and provide for. That stack, when I go through the competitor list, I don't see anyone that compares to that. And we think that is really the strength of this brand and where we look to disrupt ourselves, where we look to invest and definitely fuel and plugs into our momentum. But that's how we compare and look at ourselves and see a lot of strengths in that and the ability to keep driving our business. John Kernan : That's very helpful. Meghan, just a follow-up, maybe shifting more towards the model. The decision to go towards a geographic-level disclosure versus the channel disclosure before, how should we think about omnichannel comps going forward? You've obviously made some big investments across stores and digital. I think a lot -- you focus more on co-located stores recently and larger stores. How should we think about the balance between corporate store sales and DTC now? Meghan Frank : Yes. So we had shared, when we set out this Power of Three x2 plan, that we expected e-comm to grow slightly ahead of our CAGR of 15% sales CAGR, and store is slightly below. I would say, over the long-term time period, that view hasn't changed. We've seen, I would say, strength in both channels coming off of '23: e-comm total growth, 17%, stores 21%; e-comm comped at 17%, and stores at 9%. So continue to see opportunity across both channels and leveraging that on the ecosystem. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Kelly Crago : This is Kelly on for Paul. Just wanted to follow up on the slowdown that you're seeing in the U.S. currently. Is one category or gender driving the slowdown? Or is it more broad-based? And then secondly, just curious if you're assuming some pickup in traffic in the U.S. as a result of some of these marketing investments you're making in 1Q as we move throughout the year. Meghan Frank : Kelly, I would say, the slowdown we're experiencing in the U.S. is fairly broad-based. As Calvin mentioned, we have identified some opportunities that we can go after and product specifically on color and on women sizing, so on the 0 to 4 size range. And then in terms of traffic, we do have -- you'll see in our guidance, Q2 through Q4 is the growth rate is slightly ahead of what we're guiding to in Q1, given Q1 guide at 9 to 10, and then the full year at 10 to 11, excluding the 53rd week. Kelly Crago : And just to clarify, is that being driven by what you would expect to be an improvement in the U.S. relative to what you're seeing in 1Q? Meghan Frank : Yes. We'd expect some marginal improvement. Operator : The next question comes from Abbie Zvejnieks with Piper Sandler. Abigail Zvejnieks : Just a follow-up to that one. I mean what exactly is driving those 2Q through 4Q improvements in the U.S.? Is it product? Was there something that we're lapping in 1Q that we should think about? Any color you have there? Meghan Frank : Yes. I would say it's a modest acceleration Q2 through Q4 and really points to some of the investments we're making on the marketing side in terms of new guest acquisition as well as some of the product opportunities that Calvin pointed to would be drivers of that. Calvin McDonald : Yes. I'll just add some of the products. As we obviously mentioned that we're chasing color and size. And we expect that, that will continue to improve starting in Q2 through. In fact, we're seeing -- and as color hits now, the guests respond incredibly well to it. Q2, our business shifts from leggings, still an important part, but shorts and skirts plays a much greater role. And we're seeing good results in that assortment in response to the guests now, and then the innovation that I alluded to. We have a hydrogen yarn legging coming out in summer for yoga. We have the support code bra, which is one of our further proprietary technology innovations coming out later in Q3. And then we have another innovation in leggings for the back half in the train category. So there's quite a bit of product innovation. I mentioned men's, just highlighted women's that we see playing a positive through the back half of this year. Operator : The last question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Irwin Boruchow : I guess, maybe for Meghan or Calvin, is there any way you're able to let us know what comp you're specifically modeling for Q1 and for the full year, specifically based on your guidance? And then just a follow-up to that, maybe this one's for Meghan. Gross margin is flat for Q1 and the year, but clearly, lots of outperformance overseas. We know that's a higher-margin channel. I'm assuming that means the Americas gross margins are going the other way. I guess just could you comment on that if that's correct? Is there something that's driving that? Is it markdown? Is it just deleverage? Just kind of curious how you would think about that. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Ike. So we aren't providing forward-looking comps, but we would share that we see North America below the guided growth range and then international significantly above. In terms of margins, as I mentioned, relatively flat markdowns year-over-year. And as you mentioned, we do have an overpenetration in our international regions. We are still investing behind our DC, distribution center network. That's a multiyear investment. So that would be embedded in our gross margin guide that we've provided. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present GAAP and both non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'm happy to be here to discuss our quarter one results. As you've seen from our press release, our revenue growth was modestly ahead of our expectations, while EPS came in even stronger. On today's call, I'll share some highlights regarding our performance in quarter one, including my perspective on our U.S. business and what our teams have been working on. Next, I'll speak to the recent departure of our Chief Product Officer and the opportunities our new structure unlocks for us. Then I'll provide some details on our product innovations and brand activation. In addition, Meghan will review our financials, and we will close out our time today by taking your questions. So let's get started. In the first quarter, total revenue increased 10%, or 11% in constant currency. By region, we saw continued strong momentum in our international business with revenue in China Mainland up 52% and rest of the world up 30%, both in constant currency. In the Americas, revenue increased 4% in constant currency with Canada up 12% and the U.S. up 2%. By merchandise category, women's increased 10%, men's increased 15%, and accessories remains positive and up 2%, which is impressive given the exceptionally strong performance last year. Earnings per share were $2.54 versus EPS of $2.28 in quarter one last year. In addition, we repurchased nearly $300 million of stock in quarter one, an additional $230 million in the second quarter thus far, and our board recently increased our authorization by $1 billion, bringing our capacity to repurchase shares up to approximately $1.7 billion. As you can see, our business remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with guests around the world. We are engaging with them through our unique and compelling activations and brand campaigns, and we continue to drive the business with new product innovations. Let me now share some additional quarter one details by region. As I mentioned, our business remains strong in every international market in which we operate as our brand is resonating with guests across regions and geographies. Our approach to growth follows the model we've implemented so successfully in North America and includes omnichannel distribution via highly productive stores and e-commerce sites, a product assortment which offers technical and versatile styles and is frequently updated with new innovations to enable our guests to sweat in any way they choose and a unique and compelling approach to building brand awareness, which includes local activations as well as larger-scale brand campaigns. Our international business remains under-penetrated and continues to represent a significant growth opportunity. For the full year 2023, international was only 21% of our business, and over the long run, I see the potential for it to grow to 50% as we continue to expand our presence outside of North America. Shifting now to the U.S. As we mentioned on our last call, we've seen a slower start to the year due to several internal factors, including missed opportunity in women's and bags, which we are actively addressing, and some ongoing choppiness in the consumer environment. Our men's business has maintained its momentum, driven by strong guest response to our innovations across performance, lounge, and our ABC franchise. Our market share gains were strong in men's in quarter one, and with unaided brand awareness of less than 20% in the U.S., our opportunity to continue to grow this business remains significant. When looking at women's, we did not maximize the business in the U.S., which was the result of several missed opportunities, including a color palette and our core assortment, particularly in leggings, that was too narrow. Where we had color, guests responded well, we just needed more as they are looking for additional choices. And we are also out of stock in some of our smaller sizes. And in addition, we saw a fantastic guest response to our newer styles of bags such as the two-tone tote, but did not buy these styles with enough depth to fully capture the demand. Meghan will share our guidance with you later in the call, but as you've seen, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the year. In quarter two, we expect revenue growth of 9% to 10%, roughly in line with our quarter one growth rate. Our guidance for the full year continues to call for revenue growth of 10% to 11%, excluding the 53rd week, and includes a modest step-up in the second-half. In summary, we are moving in the right direction and understand the root cause of the issues. And with the lead times, we expect to be in a more optimal inventory position in the second-half of 2024. In addition, our upcoming product launches and innovation flows, which I'll speak to shortly, are skewed toward the back half of the year, which is another reason for our optimism. Looking out further, our growth opportunities in the U.S. remain compelling. Our unaided brand awareness is only in the low-30s. Using our unique approach, which combines local engagement, community activations, and larger scale brand campaigns, we continue to have a significant runway to introduce new guests to lululemon and drive them to our stores and e-commerce sites. We are just beginning to leverage the power of our membership program, which now has approximately 20 million members in North America. By offering benefits like early access to product and invitations to exclusive events, we are increasing our member base and powerfully engaging with them, which will ultimately drive both spend and long-term value. Our stores remain highly productive with new locations performing well, and we continue to be pleased with our store optimization program. As a reminder, in 2024, our plan calls for five to 10 new store openings and 15 to 20 optimizations. Looking beyond 2024, our real estate opportunities in the U.S. remain significant, and our plans include continuing both of our new store opening program and our optimization strategy. And we continue to gain market share with outsized strength in men's where we outpaced the overall market in quarter one. Now let me speak about product innovation and some of the current shifts we recently announced within our organizational structure. As you know, our Chief Product Officer, Sun Choe, recently decided to leave lululemon to take a job elsewhere in the industry. Sun and I had been in regular conversations, so I understood her personal and career goals. We regularly update our succession plans, which allowed us to seamlessly step into our new plan leadership structure. I'm excited about how the new structure will bring new perspectives, curiosity, and leadership across our product teams. This approach will drive several meaningful benefits in the near and long term, including increasing our speed of innovation, stimulating creativity, and enhancing team accountability around product flows and assortment. We have a strong and dynamic product team led by Jonathan Cheung, our Global Creative Director, who now reports to me, and Liz Binder, our Chief Merchandising Officer, who now reports to Nikki Neuburger, as she steps into her expanded role as Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer. Jonathan, Liz, and the entire product team will continue to drive innovation, design technical product that looks great, and solve for the unmet needs of our guests. And under Nikki's proven leadership, the merchant and the brand teams will be more fully integrated, which will streamline decision-making and ensure we show up powerfully and consistently for our guests across all markets. All of this is intended to speed the ideation process with regard to product storytelling and further improve our speed-to-market. And these shifts will help maintain and enhance our pipeline of innovation. I want to now share several recent and upcoming product launches that continue to show our team's ability to create compelling product. In quarter one, in women's, our guests continued to respond very well to our key second-layer franchises, including Define, Scuba, and Softstreme. In addition, we continued to see strength in bottoms led by bike shorts and our away from body styles. Looking forward, we're on track to bring significant innovation into our assortment beginning the end of quarter two and into the second-half of the year. Within women's, we have some exciting new launches planned within our leggings assortment. These include a new innovation designed for hot, low-impact workouts, and made from a new performance fabric, one of our quickest drawing and lightest weight to date. And later in the year, we'll launch another new type, our most versatile swimsuit line, providing a completely different feel state, which will bring newness and innovation into our train assortment. The upcoming newness in leggings is a perfect example of how we continue to bring innovation into our core categories where we already have significant strength. Our teams continue to expand our product offerings with new technical solutions, and I'm excited for you to see these new styles. Let's now take a look at men's. In quarter one, we continued to see strong response to our lounge offering, including steady state and soft jersey. In addition, we recently launched a Smooth Spacer hoodie, which provides a cooling sensation and is a great recovery piece to wear home after a workout. We are pleased with the variety of and performance of our lounge offerings. We plan to fuel this strength by building our inventory levels and expanding the silhouettes offered in all three of these collections for fall. On the technical side of men's, we continued to see great response to our Pace Breaker and Zeroed In franchises, both of which we will expand later this year. Zeroed In is following in the footsteps of our other key technical styles for men and is quickly becoming a top performer in train. I also want to mention our new Show Zero technology, which we just launched in men's polo shirts. This fabric uses innovative construction to hide the appearance of sweat on the outside of the shirt. These polos are highly versatile and can be worn on the golf course to the office or many other occasions. And in footwear, our new cityverse style has done extremely well, particularly in men's where demand has exceeded our expectations. These are just the latest examples of the disruptive innovations we are known for and will continue to create. Shifting now to brand awareness. As you know, our unaided brand awareness remains low in every country where we operate, except our home market of Canada. We will continue to activate across our grassroots and global platforms to increase awareness and bring new guests into the lululemon brand. Let me share just a few examples. In quarter one, we held several successful earned media activations, including launching our new cityverse and Beyondfeel footwear styles in New York, hosting our further women's Ultramarathon event near Palm Springs, California, and unveiling our kit for the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Athletes in Toronto. In quarter two, we will again host our successful Summer Sweat Games in China while also bringing a version of this event to our Essentials members in North America with our Membership Summer Series. And in quarter three, we'll strategically test TV again with another men's campaign. Building on the success of last year's campaign, this year's spot will focus on men and feature some high-profile personalities. Before I hand it over to Meghan to discuss our financials and guidance outlook, I'd like to share some additional thoughts about the rest of the year. Our pipeline of innovation and our launch cadence for the second-half of 2024 is particularly strong. In the U.S., our teams have been making the appropriate adjustments in closing the inventory gaps in terms of color and sizing. Our brand awareness remains low but is growing and our store productivity remains among the best in the industry. We continue to engage with our guests in unique and compelling ways and inspire them with our differentiated product innovations. I'm optimistic with regards to our performance in the second-half of the year and beyond as we continue to execute well against our Power of Three times 2 goal of doubling our revenue in five years. Meghan, over to you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. Our Q1 results exceeded our expectations, driven by above-plan performance across the key areas of our P&L. Our business remained strong in our international regions in Canada, and in the U.S., we've seen a slower start to the year in line with our expectations. As you've seen in our press release, we're maintaining our revenue guidance for the year, while increasing our EPS guidance. This reflects our optimism in our plans and strategies for 2024, many of which you just heard Calvin speak about. In addition, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios and manage our business to protect against downside. Before sharing the details of our Q1 performance and our guidance outlook, let me provide a quick update on our Mexico operations. In May, we signed an agreement with our franchise partners to acquire their lululemon Mexico operations in the 15 retail locations they currently operate. Our partner has built an incredible foundation for our brand in Mexico, and our acquisition will allow us to more efficiently continue to expand, grow our community, and enhance the guest experience. We are acquiring the business for approximately $160 million in cash, and the deal is expected to close in the next several weeks subject to customary closing conditions. From a P&L standpoint, we expect the transaction to have an immaterial impact on our financial results for the fiscal year 2024. Let me now share the details of our Q1 performance. For Q1, total net revenue rose 10% to $2.2 billion and comparable sales increased 7%. Within our regions, the results were as follows. Americas revenue increased 3% on a reported basis, or 4% in constant currency, with comparable sales flat. China Mainland revenue increased 45% on a reported basis, or 52% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 33%. And in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 27% on a reported basis or 30% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing by 26%. In our store channel, total sales increased 12%. We ended the quarter with 711 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 49 net-new lululemon stores since Q1 of 2023. During the quarter, we completed three optimizations. In our digital channel, revenue increased 8% and contributed $906 million of top-line, or 41% of total revenue. By category, women's revenue increased by 10% versus last year, men's increased by 15%, and accessories grew 2% on top of a strong 67% last year. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.28 billion, or 57.7% of net revenue, compared to 57.5% of net revenue in Q1 2023. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points relative to last year and was driven primarily by the following. A 120-basis point increase in overall product margin, driven primarily by lower product costs, lower air freight costs, and lower inventory provisions, offset somewhat by a 50 basis-point increase in markdowns. The 120-basis point increase in-product margin was partially offset by 70 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs and 30 basis points of deleverage on foreign exchange. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $842 million, or 38.1% of net revenue, compared to 37.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. The 70 basis points of SG&A deleverage was better than our guidance of 130 basis points to 140 basis points and was driven by timing, slightly better top-line, and prudent management of expenses. Foreign exchange was flat in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $433 million, or 19.6% of net revenue, compared to operating margin of 20.1% in Q1 2023. Tax expense for the quarter was $134.5 million, or 29.5% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.1% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in non-deductible expenses in international jurisdictions. Net income for the quarter was $321 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, compared to earnings per diluted share of $2.28 for the first quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $131 million for the quarter versus $137 million in Q1 last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multi-year distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q1 was $1.3 billion. We are pleased with our inventory levels, which declined 15% versus last year. Relative to our expectations, higher revenue and foreign exchange contributed to the decrease. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 751,000 shares at an average price of $395. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $530 million of stock. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, and I'm happy that our board has recently increased our authorization by $1 billion. With this new authorization, we now have approximately $1.7 billion of capacity to continue to buy back our shares. Let me speak now to our guidance outlook. We remain excited with our pipeline of innovation, brand activations and marketing plans for 2024. As it remains early in the year and the consumer environment in the U.S. is dynamic, we continue to be prudent in our planning while also continuing to invest in our strategic roadmap, which will set us up well for both the medium and long term. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. This range represents growth of 11% to 12% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 10% to 11%. We continue to expect to open 35 to 40 net-new company-operated stores in 2024 and complete approximately 40 co-located optimizations. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low-double-digits. Our new store openings in 2024 will include five to 10 stores in the Americas with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland. For the full year, we continue to forecast gross margin to be approximately flat with adjusted gross margin in 2023. Within gross margin, we expect both markdowns in air freight to be relatively flat with last year. Turning now to SG&A for the full year. We continue to forecast leverage of approximately 10 basis points versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to strategically advance our Power of Three times two road map, with investments in marketing and brand-building aimed at increasing our awareness in acquiring new guests, international growth and market expansion, and technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. When looking at operating margin for full year 2024, we continue to expect an increase of approximately 10 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. For the full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2023 adjusted effective rate of 28.7%. The increase relative to last year relates primarily to lower stock-based compensation deductions and the favorable adjustments we realized when filing our tax returns in 2023. For the fiscal year 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.27 to $14.47 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. It does include the impact of our share repurchases year-to-date and also higher forecasted interest income. When looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to decline in the mid-teens in Q2 and then increase in the second-half of the year as we anniversary last year's decline. We continue to expect the capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. This spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multi-year distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Shifting now to Q2. We expect revenue in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.42 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. We expect to open 14 net-new company-operated stores in Q2. We expect gross margin in Q2 to decrease 100 basis points to 110 basis points relative to Q2 2023. The decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in our multi-year distribution center project. We expect product margin to be relatively flat with last year, inclusive of an increase in markdowns, but a smaller increase than we saw in Q1 of this year. In Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage by 40 basis points to 60 basis points relative to Q2 2023. This will be driven predominantly by favorable regional penetration, a shift in timing of spend related to certain brand campaigns from Q2 last year to Q1 this year, and leverage on top-line and ongoing prudent expense management. And looking at operating margin for Q2, we expect a decrease of approximately 50 basis points to 60 basis points relative to last year. However, we continue to expect 10 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.92 to $2.97 versus EPS of $2.68 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 30%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. In closing, I want to say I am energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited for what the future holds for lululemon. I was in China last week, and when I'm traveling in markets around the world, I see how powerfully our brand resonates across cultures and geographies. While we make some strategic adjustments in the U.S., our leadership team continues to challenge ourselves and our teams by asking how high is high. It's that mentality and passion for our brand that will enable us to navigate the near term as we build towards the long-term opportunities for lululemon that we know exist. In closing, I want to thank the senior leaders of lululemon as well as our teams in every market around the world for your unyielding focus on creating amazing products and experiences for our guests. I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. Calvin, you spoke about making some strategic adjustments in the U.S. Can you speak to your confidence in the Lululemon brand and the growth trajectory that you see in the U.S. going forward as well as the timing and magnitude of some of those strategic adjustments that you're making? And then perhaps contextualize the traffic and conversion trends that you saw in your U.S. business as you move throughout the quarter? Thank you very much. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Brooke. In terms of our excitement and optimism for growth in every market, including the U.S., it remains as strong today as it was at the beginning of this year and obviously coming off of 2023, which was a very strong year for us. In the U.S., in particular, there are a number of areas of growth that we still see that have not changed. Continuing to acquire guests. We have very low unaided brand awareness, as you know, opportunities in categories across the wear occasions as we've tested and moved deeper into performance as well as into lounge and social, our accessories business and our men's. And our store fleet, which is still early in terms of opportunity, not just in expanding as well as optimizing and creating an even better environment for our product and our guests to shop. So in terms of the U.S., nothing has changed from the last few years into 2023 into the first quarter of this year. The opportunity for us when I look at the business is men's has a number of new innovative launches that are resonating and he's responding very well to. In performance with the Zeroed In and continuing the success of the changes from last year on the Pace Breaker into some of the key categories we identified, run, golf, and train, as well into some of the new franchises in the lounge category that we launched, he is responding incredibly well to that. And we saw that in our performance around the globe as well in the U.S. and we saw that in our share performance in the U.S., where we saw outsized gains in men's. In our women's business, we had some missed opportunity, really in our color palette, in particular, in some of the key categories such as our legging business where we didn't have enough color newness. The one color and newness we did have, she responded incredibly well to, but she was looking for more, and our palette that we chose was just more limited than what she was looking for, as well as because of the success in Q4, we came into the year with some missed opportunity across our size profile, particularly our smaller sizes. All of this is within our control, all of this the teams have been chasing, and we expect much of that to be addressed in the second-half of this year, as well as a lot of the newness and innovation we did have planned for this year in our women's business was scheduled more for mid to back half of the year. We have some exciting new innovation coming in our leggings, in particular in the next few weeks. In early July, we'll be launching a new innovation in leggings with a Hudson Yards called Breeze Through. So there were some missed opportunities in women's, but in terms of the health of the brand, the strength and the potential of the growth, nothing has changed. Traffic was positive in the quarter in the U.S. We did see the opportunity in conversion and we attribute that to, as I mentioned, the known missed opportunities as it relates to some missed opportunity in color in our women's business. Brooke Roach : Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : The next question is from Alex Stratton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alex Stratton : Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. I've got one for Calvin and maybe one for Meghan. Maybe, Calvin, just bigger-picture, I feel like we rarely hear of assortment missteps in lulu's history. So kind of what changed, or maybe what do you think provokes that this year? And then bigger-picture maybe for Meghan, China, obviously a key growth area for you all. Can you talk about how the competitive landscape is different or similar? And then how you think about the revenue potential for lulu in that market over time? Thanks a lot. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. On -- in terms of the track record of the team, I agree, we have a very talented a team across the product organization in both design and merchandising. And this was just a quarter where the chosen color palette was more narrow than I think the consumer coming into this year was looking for. We know that the consumer environment remains dynamic with inflation, higher interest rates. So it's weighing on the mind of the consumer and we also know they will spend, but they're being selective. And I think with our color palette, it -- we had opportunity because where we had it, she responded incredibly well. Combined with the success we've seen in growing our guest base and broadening cross sizes, the teams have been chasing into that to determine the go-forward size profile across the sizes and the different styles in both performance, lounge, and social. So I'm confident that those opportunities have been identified. I'm confident when I look to the innovation and the pipeline as well as just how we bring newness to core in the back half of this year and forward that a lot of that learning has been addressed, and we were able to address it and control it. Meghan Frank : Yes. And thanks, Alex. From a China standpoint, we're very pleased with our business in that market. Continue to see very strong trends in Q1, so plus 52% constant currency China Mainland. And I would say from a competitive landscape, we continue to see strong business on our side. Definitely closely monitoring the environment, but we're really still early in our growth journey there, and no concerns at this point in time. Alex Stratton : Thanks a lot. Good luck. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So maybe, Calvin, just higher level, or larger picture as we think about the U.S. business. I mean, do you believe anything has structurally changed if we're thinking about on a longer-term horizon? And then on the progression from here, just how best to think about progress to date that you've already made maybe within stock level, sizing and color? And then just the cadence with each of those as well as the product pipeline in the back half of the year? Just anything that you're really excited about that would support the sequential improvement as the year progresses. Calvin McDonald : Great. Thanks, Matt. I'll start with absolutely nothing has changed in terms of the growth potential of this brand, not just internationally across all markets, but in the U.S. As you know, 2023 was a very strong market for us. Quarter four was a very strong quarter for us in the U.S. and have identified some missed opportunities in Q1. We saw success in our men's business where we did bring newness, innovation, color, and we had less of an impact on the size, status, and very pleased with that growth as well as that growth relative to the market and the outsized gains we saw in share. In the accessories business, we know that we're cycling over the success of the Everywhere Belt Bag, which is incredible. It really validates and shows what's possible for our brand in accessories in particular in bags. And although that bag continues to perform well, not quite to the levels of last year, but the team has introduced a number of new styles of bags that the guests responded incredibly well to. We just didn't have the depth of inventory to satisfy the demand that could have offset the -- some of the headwind of the Everywhere Belt Bag success last year. That is something we can control. We know the newness is resonating and the guest is moving beyond just an Everywhere Belt Bag. And we have opportunity and the teams have been chasing into that and expect to be in a better in-stock position in the back half. The Two-Tone bag is a good example of that, sold out almost immediately. We were able to chase, bring some in, offer it as an Essentials member early access. It again sold and did incredibly well and we continue to chase into that. So we have a number of exciting, very successful bags in our accessory business that we are chasing inventory in and excited to see how that will contribute -- continue to contribute to our growth. And then in the women's business, traffic, as I mentioned, was positive, engagement in the brand was positive where we had newness. She engaged incredibly well in some of the new innovation we brought. She continued to perform very well in some of the new activities that we've continued to lean in on, tennis, golf, as well as our position in yoga and train and run have seen strength. We can really attribute the missed opportunity to a handful of categories, leggings in particular, as I've mentioned, and really linked to color and less color than last year, which was a choice in the palette, more narrow and based on where the consumer is this year a missed opportunity for us. But nothing from a brand, from an opportunity to grow unaided awareness, and engagement in the brand has fundamentally shifted and changed. And I remain as optimistic and excited about our growth potential in the U.S. as I am in all of our international markets. And we see that in the performance of this quarter with fantastic growth in Mainland China, strong growth in the rest of the world, how the brand is continuing to grow, continuing to acquire guests and resonate and the uniqueness of our product. And I don't see anybody with product comparable from a from a positioning perspective. So I do believe the differentiation of the brand is the same, and we know what the opportunities are and what we can control. And that's what the teams are focused on, and definitely we'll get stronger as we as we trade through this year. Matthew Boss : That's great color, Calvin. Meghan, just maybe could you speak to health of current inventory? And then just drivers of markdowns in the first quarter, how best to think about markdowns in the second quarter and the back half of the year? Meghan Frank : Yes, sure. So inventory, we were down 15% at the end of the quarter. So that was on the lower end of the range that we provided of high-single-digit to low-double-digit decline. And we do expect the second-half inventory will grow year-over-year relatively in line with sales. I would say at this point in time, we're very pleased with the currency and composition of our inventory outside of some of the opportunity areas that Calvin mentioned. So well-positioned there from an overall perspective. In terms of markdowns, we were up 50 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We believe Q2 will be slightly above last year as well, though less than Q1, and we are still expecting essentially flat markdowns for the year. And with that, some of the opportunity areas that Calvin described in terms of color and sizing. And we are continuing to chase into as well as some other items that are working for us for the second-half of the year and we've got some innovation teed up and believe that will drive the gas towards the full-price component of our assortment and a lot markdowns for the year. Matthew Boss : Great. Best of luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey, thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys. So maybe I can just continue that last question, Meghan. Could you speak a little bit to your confidence in the sustainability of the product margins in the U.S.? And then I guess, I'd be curious what you think are some of the differences driving the gap in results between Canada and the U.S., a little bit of notable difference there. And then maybe just a little help understanding the U.S. consumer dynamics. Calvin, bigger-picture, how has purchase frequency, UPT, AUR changed, if at all? Looking -- as you look across the cohorts that you acquired pre-COVID, during COVID, after COVID, are there any change in key customer behaviors or KPIs to point out? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Michael. So in terms of U.S. product margin, I don't see that changing over the long term. We run a highly full-price business. We have no plans to change our strategy there. So I would view some of the current challenges with assortment and slightly higher markdowns as temporary. And then from a Canada to U.S. perspective, the opportunity areas that Calvin outlined in terms of color, sizing were more prominent drivers last year in the U.S. as well as the Everywhere Belt Bag was a more popular item in the U.S. as well. And so that's driving the difference in terms of trend. Calvin McDonald : And with the consumer, I sort of mentioned that obviously, we're monitoring the environment and it remains dynamic. But we do know that the guest is being more selective, but will spend where they choose. So we believe our product is differentiated in the marketplace, stands out in terms of quality as well as the versatility, which I think is a key element of the product of how it can be worn multiple wear occasions and use cases across either performance activities and/or through social and lounge, which these are unique positions. And the missed opportunity is really what that we did not provide her in terms of the assortment she was looking for in certain areas. Obviously, where we did, she responded incredibly well and he continued to. When I look at the overall mix, nothing really to call out. UPT and AUR, no change, no fundamental shifts and changes there. Really, traffic was positive, as I mentioned. In the quarter, it was conversion that we just saw an opportunity on with guests coming in and either not acquiring as much and/or as they didn't necessarily see the color in that product. But we believe the loyalty and the engagement with our guests over multiple years, which we've continued. And coming off of Q4, this is a very short transition as we course-correct and adjust some of these product opportunities and the teams have been in that work. So nothing that I'm concerned about long term in terms of our ability. We have a very sticky guest. We have a brand that there's a lot of love for and differentiated product. And we know where the opportunity is, and the teams have been chasing that for the back half of this year. So I'm not -- have not seen anything and I'm not concerned with any fundamental shifts in the guest or the guest loyalty or attention with this brand. Michael Binetti : Thank you very much, guys. Operator : The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ike Boruchow : Hey, everyone. A quick question, let's circle back to Matt's question about the markdown. So I just want to make sure I understand, Meghan. So the markdown you guided in three months ago for Q1 was, I believe, flat, and it came in down 50 bps. So I'm kind of curious, number one, what exactly transpired in the quarter kind of drive that? Obviously, you may beat the gross margin line, but that line item, what exactly happened? And then you're maintaining the full year at flat, but you're coming off the Q1 was down and then you're saying Q2 will be down again. So it just feels like now there's a back half like needed ramp-up in markdown versus before there wasn't. So I guess, I'm just trying to understand like the progress of the full-year for the gross margin line as well. Meghan Frank : Yes. Hi, Ike. So in terms of markdowns for the first quarter. So I would say the challenges we saw with assortment and color and sizing, and in addition to that, the environment, we did see gaps gravitate more towards the markdown proportion of our assortment. So we saw 50 basis points increase. We believe Q2 will be still up to last year, but lower than -- a lower increase than Q1. Q1 is a relatively small portion of our markdowns for the year. So when we think about the full year, we are maintaining that essentially flat markdown rate for the full year, but we would see some opportunity in the second-half just given some of the actions we're taking to correct those pieces of the assortment in terms of the color sizing, and then also some exciting innovation that Calvin spoke to as well as other portions of the assortment that we're chasing into that are working for us today. So feel well-positioned headed into the second-half of the year. Ike Boruchow : Okay. So it's mainly a function of Q1. This isn't that impactful for the year on the markdown rate? Meghan Frank : Yes. Ike Boruchow : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. You reiterated your sales guidance for the year, but curious if you've changed your outlook in any of the regions versus how you were thinking at the beginning of the year? And you also talked about there not being any structural differences in the U.S. market, but curious how you'd characterize the competitive landscape near term in 1Q relative to what you saw in the second-half of '23? Any changes in promotional cadence amongst competitors out there that you're paying more attention to? Thanks. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Paul. I would say from a regional and country level. A little bit of feedback. [Technical Difficulty] Sorry about that. So from a regional and country-specific perspective, we have not changed our outlook materially for the balance of the year. I would say the slight Q1 overperformance would have come from international region and primarily China. Calvin McDonald : Yes, Paul. In terms of the competitive landscape, the second part I'll address first, have not seen anything dramatically different from a promotional intensity perspective. There remains competitors in this space that use promo as a means to drive demand for their product. We've seen that increase over the last few years, but I wouldn't say in this quarter, it's either gone deeper or pulled back. It's sort of the same, which I would say is a heightened level from a few years ago, but nothing dramatic in the quarter. And competition in our space has always been there and been intense, and we've always been able to continue to perform and compete. And nothing has shifted from quarter four and 2023, where we saw our performance in the U.S. be very strong into Q1. And I really therefore point to the missed opportunities that we had versus it being a competitive impact on our business. Our men's business, and there are competitors in the men's space performed very well where we saw the outsized share gains because of the product, the innovation, the newness and the color palette was there. It resonated and very pleased with the success momentum that has continued in that business. I shared the accessories, and the excitement behind the newness, but lack of depth to satisfy the demand. And the mis opportunity in women's, which is really, we control that. It's within our control and we've been chasing it. So competition has always been there. I haven't seen anything dramatically shift and change in the quarter and definitely not from Q4 to Q1 where we had a very strong quarter. And therefore, I really do point to missed opportunities that we that we have. Operator : The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. I guess I'm curious if you've seen U.S. trends kind of stabilize and become more predictable? And within the women's business, it wasn't clear to me whether you think you lost share within the quarter in the U.S. or whether maybe the whole market was a bit softer for the segment. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Sharon. I would say in terms of U.S. performance, it did come in as we expected in Q1. And so I would say to that from that standpoint, it was in line with our expectations. Calvin McDonald : And in terms of share, in Q1, we did gain market share in both the U.S. adult apparel industry as well as the U.S. adult active wear industry. We saw outsized gains in men's where we significantly outperformed the overall market. In women's, we were flattish based on the missed opportunities that I identified. Operator : The next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Dana Telsey : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Calvin and Meghan, as you think about store productivity and levels of new stores in North America, is that changing at all from how you thought about it before? And how are new stores opening? And then lastly, as you think about the men's business, which seems to be growing very strongly, any difference in terms of what you're seeing overseas versus in North America for the men's business? Thank you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Dana. I would say in terms of new store openings, we continue to see opportunity and runway across all of our geographies. In the U.S. specifically, we see sales -- very productive sales per square foot above our average, which is around $1,600 per square foot. We tend to look at new stores as ramping into their full mature volume over a two- to four-year period. I would say we're continuing to see that, and we see ample runway in both the U.S. as well as importantly, our international region. Calvin McDonald : Hi, Dana. I'll chat with Matt. Just I'll just add in terms of the optimization of our doors around the world, including in the U.S., very excited with the results we see, the percentage of the portfolio that we still have available to be optimized, and obviously the product innovative pipeline that is creating opportunities for these additional categories within that space. And that's markets from APAC to Australia into the U.S. So very excited about how we will continue to invest, optimize, and showcase our product innovation in an even a stronger fashion. In terms of men's, men's globally is performing very strong. Interestingly, it took us a number of years to get to our penetration of the men's business in North America, and we're seeing the international markets get there a lot quicker. So it really earlier on, lululemon is a dual-gender brand in these markets and men are responding to the newness in the product and the innovation globally. In similar fashion, when we see the strength of the ABC, we see the strength of our performance franchises. Interestingly, when we see the success of the new launches, the Zeroed In franchise or the expansion of Pace Breaker are resonating around the globe in all of our markets. So excited to see the growth in men's globally as well as in the U.S. Dana Telsey : Thank you. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : And that question is from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on a nice quarter. Calvin, I think I heard you say international potential to reach 50% of sales. How does the complexion of that look on an omnichannel basis and geography basis? Calvin McDonald : I think from a geography perspective, we haven't broken it out. Obviously, Mainland China, which continues to perform well for us. And we're still early in terms of the potential when we look at the number of doors we have, the potential of store locations, the success of our business online, unaided awareness internationally being as low as it is in every market we're in. So really the growth possibility is on stores. Digital, where we have a different degree of penetration of our digital channel, but I think all markets can be hitting 40%-plus on our digital channel in the years to come as a support and driver of that as we build out our store network and opportunity. The addition of new markets, but we're in the bulk of the right markets that are going to drive fundamentally the majority of that growth across EMEA, APAC, and Mainland China. And we are just so early in that growth that when I look at the performance and the adoption and the reception of the brand, where we are in unaided awareness, where we are in store penetration and growth and that potential, and then look at some competitive other brands and where their ratio is, that's where our aspiration is and see that opportunity. Obviously, not in the current Power of Three times two where, our goal is to quadruple our business again on top of quadrupling it. But there is nothing systemic that's preventing the brand from achieving a 50% international, 50% North America penetration in the future. John Kernan : That's outstanding. I guess, how should we think about the omnichannel business in the Americas? You've made some big investments in co-located stores, you're still growing square footage in Canada and United States. I guess, how should we think about -- there's a DTC platform with tremendous scale, e-commerce with tremendous scale. How do we think about the balance of stores and e-commerce going forward in North America? Meghan Frank : Yes. So we haven't put a fine point on stores versus e-comm. What we shared in our current five-year plan is we expected e-comm to grow slightly ahead of our 15% CAGR and stores slightly below. And but we are remaining agile and going to where the guest wants to shop with us. As you mentioned, we've invested in omnichannel capabilities and really look at it as a seamless experience across both. And so see slightly more opportunity in e-commerce over the longer term. And -- but we'll remain agile in how we approach the business. John Kernan : That's great. Thank you. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call and have a nice day.",

As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. The conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon Athletica, please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on form 10-K and our quarterly reports on form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on form 10-Q are available under the Investor section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the second quarter, as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thank you, Howard. I'm glad you could all join us on the call today to discuss our business in quarter two and a revised outlook for the second-half of the year. On today's call, I will speak to the strength in our international business. I also will spend time discussing our business in the U.S., including some missed opportunities in women's, our assessment of the root causes. The plans underway to address these in the near-term and the many reasons for our continued optimism regarding our growth potential in the U.S. Next, I will speak to our recent brand campaigns and activations. Megan will review our financials and we will close by taking your questions. So let's get started. In the second quarter, total revenue increased 7% or 8% in constant currency. By merchandise category, women's increased 6%, men's grew 11%, and accessories increased 7%. Earnings per share increased 18% driven by strong gross margin, which contributed to 110 basis point increase in operating margin. In addition, demonstrating our continued confidence in the business, we repurchased $584 million of stock in quarter two, which brings us to $1.2 billion year-to-date. Let's now discuss our regional performance, beginning with our international business. In quarter two, we continued to see strength in our international markets as the Lululemon brand resonates with guests around the world. Growing our business outside of North America remains one of our largest opportunities, and we remain on track to quadruple international revenue from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. Momentum remains strong, with total international revenue increasing 29% or 31% in constant currency. By region, our results were as follows. China mainland increased 34% or 37% in constant currency. Rest of the World grew 24% or 27% in constant currency. In China mainland, our business remained robust in the second quarter as we continued to bring new guests into the brand through our stores and multiple e-commerce platform. In addition to our innovative product offering and on the operating model, we are requiring guest through our unique, made to field positioning which comes to life through our commitment to movement and community. All of which supports the Healthy China 2030 initiative. In quarter two, we built upon the success of our summer sweat game series with our largest activation yet. This year we expanded the games to more than 70 stores in nearly 40 cities, with approximately 10,000 guests signing up to participate. The national finals were held this past weekend in Beijing. Looking to quarter three, we will build upon last year's success and bring attention to the World Mental Health Day in October, with unique activations across several cities in China Mainland. In addition, we will expand our activations to other markets this fall, including South Korea, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. This is a great example of how our teams from around the world share ideas and activate global campaigns. Shifting to our Rest of World segment, where we continue to perform well in both EMEA and APAC. We expanded further in Southeast Asia with the opening of our second store in Thailand and our fourth in Malaysia. And in France, our Paris stores and the Lululemon brand overall benefited from the energy and excitement of the Olympics, which I'll speak to in more detail shortly. Turning to our business in the Americas, revenue increased 1% or 2% in constant currency. We continued to perform well in Canada with revenue growth of 8% or 11% in constant currency, while revenue in the U.S. was flat. This is a key area of focus for us. And I will now dive deeper into our U.S. business. Our brand remains strong in the U.S. market. Traffic was up across both channels and Google search queries remain positive. Guests are looking for our product, coming into our stores and visiting our e-commerce sites. While we continue to see growth in our men's business, we have experienced a slowdown in women's. We have improved our in-stocks in smaller sizes through Q2 and are entering Q3 better positioned. As we've analyzed our women's business in more detail, we have determined the most significant factor was a product plan that introduced less newness across core and seasonal styles. By newness, I'm referring to the seasonal updates we bring into the assortment typically expressed as color, print, patterns, and silhouettes. I'm not referring to our pipeline of innovation, which remains full and the details of which I will share with you shortly. As we have learned more, it's become clear to us that this reduced newness which is below our historical levels and stems from earlier product decisions, has impacted conversion rates given the fewer new options available to our female guests. While this reduction was seen across our women's assortment, it had a more pronounced impact in bottoms and in our online channel. The newness that we had performed well, we simply did not have enough to inspire her to purchase. As most of you know, we announced changes within our product organization in May of this year. We implemented a new reporting structure in which our Global Creative Director, Jonathan Cheung reports to me, and our Chief Merchant, Liz Binder, reports to Nikki Neuburger in her expanded role as Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer. Since this shift, Nikki and I have both spent considerable time with the teams and we are pleased that this new structure puts design and merchandising on equal footing. And reestablishes the healthy balance that must exist within a product organization. The teams are working well together and already in action. Our near-term action plan leverages our capabilities in chase and fast track design to bring more seasonal newness into our women's assortment as quickly as possible. The teams have been chasing into some of our strong performers, including aligned leggings in colors and prints, our gold zip scuba in softstreme and new silhouette and seasonal fabrications. Our fast track design capability allows us to bring newness into our assortment quicker while also testing and learning from new silhouette. For 2025, we are fast tracking several new styles within performance shorts, tops and tracksuits. We are optimistic that we will begin to see the benefits of these strategies over the upcoming quarters and return to our historical levels of newness no later than Spring 2025. Moving forward, I feel confident that the new structure and relationship between design and merchandising will lead to more ongoing conversations. And consistent decision making, and I'm excited about the newness and innovation that will be flowing into our upcoming product assortments. While we are disappointed with the recent performance in women's, we see many strengths in our U.S. business. Our store portfolio remains highly productive with significant opportunities ahead. Our industry leading sales per foot, the success of our new stores, and the positive results from our optimization program all underpin our comfort with our Power Three times Two target of approximately 5% square footage growth annually in the Americas through 2026. We are only beginning to leverage the power of our membership program, which allows us to engage more deeply with our guests, drive loyalty, and increase long-term value. We now have more than 20 million essential members. And I'll share more in a moment about how we're expanding our offerings. And while we have experienced positive increases across our brand funnel metrics in the market, there is still substantial opportunity to drive unaided brand awareness introducing lululemon to new gas segments. As you can see, there are many reasons we feel optimistic about our U.S. business and its growth potential. Let's shift now to our recent and upcoming product innovations. Beginning with men's, the business remains robust and we continue to gain market share. In quarter two, we saw strength across the assortment, including Zeroed In, which was launched this past spring and has quickly become a guest favorite in a top three performance franchise. Our Pace Breaker with the positive response to our shorts, and our recently launched pant and jacket is performing very well. Our new Show Zero Polo, which virtually eliminates the appearance of sweat, also launched this spring and has resonated well with guests and will benefit from increased inventory commitments this fall and into next year. In our lounge offering, including Soft Jersey, Steady State and Smooth Spacer, continued to perform well and we will fuel the momentum with additional styles and deeper inventory buys. In women's, I'm excited with our product road map for fall, which includes an expansion of our train offering with the introduction of a new performance fabric innovation in a tight and expansion of our Wunder Under franchise offering our iconic legging in different fabrics, seasonal updates within our line franchise, and an updated version of our Chargefeel footwear style. And our accessories business also remains positive on top of last year's strong performance. We have diversified into a compelling assortment of bags, including our new crew and double zip backpacks and additional styles within the Everywhere franchise, including a backpack and crossbody bag, which is fueling continued momentum in the category. One of our goals is to solve for the unmet needs of our guests with new and compelling technical innovations, and this will continue to separate us from other brands. With this in mind, I want to touch on Breeze Through, a new product offering this quarter for guests who participate in hot yoga and other heat intensive workouts. It was a small buy. We view this as a test and learn. And while guests were excited by the fabric, the design didn't meet their expectations. Listening to our guests is central to who we are and how we grow our brand. And we took the right step of pausing on sales and look forward to reintroducing the fabric in the future. This decision had a negligible impact on our performance in this quarter. I'd now like to spend a few minutes speaking about our recent brand campaigns and activations. Increasing brand awareness and consideration remains one of our single biggest opportunities in almost every market in which we operate. So let me highlight a few examples now. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to offer many benefits to members of our free essentials program. In early June, we hosted a members only weekend at Peloton Studios, New York. This exclusive sold out event featured live classes, a 5K run, sessions with our Peloton ambassadors, and a wrap-up party. We also launched partner perks for members. We partnered with 12 brands, including Aura and berries, that offer our members exclusive perks and benefits. And the early feedback from guests has been very positive. These strategies illustrate just a few of the ways we engage with our guests beyond a simple purchase transaction by offering exclusive experiences and benefits and helping them feel their best. All of which drives and deepens loyalty. Our partnership with the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic teams came to life with the games in Paris and continues for the next several days during the Paralympics. As a Canadian, I'm incredibly proud of our athletes and how our brand showed up during the games. Through our partnership, we outfit athletes for their off field activities, and the Lululemon brand clearly benefit from the podium time the team achieved and the exposure during the opening and closing ceremonies. We further leveraged our partnership with a popup shop in Canada House and by offering our Team Canada collection in our nearby stores in Paris, across Canada, in both stores and e-commerce and in the U.S. through our e-commerce channel. This partnership is a great example of how we are elevating the lululemon brand on the world stage by associating with lead athletes, gaining significant earned media, and growing brand awareness globally. Another area of focus for us is back to school. Bringing younger guests, and particularly men into the brand remains an opportunity as we increase awareness regarding the versatility of our merchandise and the breadth of our offering. Football players DK Metcalf and Odell Beckham Jr. starred in this year's campaign in North America, and it features our loungewear offering for both men and women and our Cityverse sneaker. Before I hand it over to Megan to discuss our financials, let me share our high level thinking on our guidance for the remainder of the year. For quarter three and the full-year, excluding the 53rd week, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 7%, relatively in line with quarter two performance. Our full-year revenue guidance acknowledges the uncertainty around the shorter holiday shopping season and the U.S. election in quarter four. Our teams remain focused on the actions I detailed for you. We plan for our penetration of newness to improve in the second-half of 2024, and we expect to be back to our historical levels of newness as we start 2025. While you can see our focus on the U.S., other aspects of our business remain strong, and we are committed to delivering on our Power of Three Times Two target of doubling revenue from $6.25 billion in '21 to $12.5 billion in '26. Using our revised guidance for this year, our three year revenue growth CAGR from '21 through '24 is 19%, ahead of the 15% CAGR we laid out in our plan. I'm excited with our new leadership structure, driving product direction for '25 and our future pipeline of innovation. I feel optimistic we can accelerate growth in our U.S. women's business while continuing to deliver strong performance in men's and international. Meghan, over to you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. While revenue in Q2 remained strong in all of our international regions in Canada, the U.S. business was softer for the reasons Calvin just detailed. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, driven predominantly by strong gross margin. Markdowns were flat versus the prior year and better than expected. And when looking at expenses, we continue to manage the business prudently while protecting key investments for the long term. Let me now share the details of Q2 performance. For Q2, total net revenue rose 7% to $2.4 billion and constant dollar comparable sales increased 3%. Within our regions, results were as follows : Americas revenue increased 1% or 2% in constant currency, comparable sales declined 2%; China Mainland revenue increased 34% or 37% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 23%; and in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 24% or 27% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing by 20%. In our store channel, total sales increased 11%, and we ended the quarter with 721 stores globally. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 49 net new lululemon stores since Q2 of 2023. During the quarter, we opened 10 net new stores and completed 6 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 2% and contributed $900 million of top line or 38% of total revenue. And by category, men's revenue increased 11% versus last year and women's increased 6%, while accessories grew 7%. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.4 billion or 59.6% of net revenue compared to 58.8% of net revenue in Q2 2023. The gross profit rate in Q2 increased 80 basis points, significantly better than our guidance and was driven primarily by the following : a 130 basis point increase in product margin, driven primarily by favorable IMU from lower product costs, markdowns were flat year-over-year and better than expected; 30 basis points of net deleverage on fixed costs and 20 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I would also note that our pause on the sale of Breathe Through had a negligible impact on gross margin in the quarter. Relative to our guidance, which was a decline in gross margin of 100 to 110 basis points, the upside was driven predominantly by prudent management of fixed expenses within gross margin, favorable mix and lower-than-expected markdowns. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $872 million or 36.8% of net revenue compared to 37% of net revenue for the same period last year. Foreign exchange contributed 10 basis points of deleverage. Overall, the 20 basis points of leverage in the quarter was below our guidance of 40 to 60 basis points and resulted from the lower-than-expected top line. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $540 million or 22.8% of net revenue compared to 21.7% of net revenue in Q2 2023. Tax expense for the quarter was $165.3 million or 29.6% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.8% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $393 million or $3.15 per diluted share compared to $2.68 for the second quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $145 million for the quarter compared to approximately $146 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory declined 14%, in line with our expectations with units declining in the mid-single-digit range. We repurchased nearly 1.9 million in shares in Q2 at an average price of $310. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of stock. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders. And currently, we have approximately $1 billion remaining on our repurchase program. Let me now share our detailed guidance outlook for the remainder of the year. At the highest level, we are assuming that revenue trends in the second half of the year remained fairly consistent with Q2, when excluding the 53rd week and the impact of a shorter holiday shopping season in Q4. I would also note that our pause on the sale of Breathe Through had a negligible impact on our revenue and gross margin guidance for the year. We feel optimistic with the work our teams are doing to improve the newness we offer within our U.S. women's assortment. So we continue to acknowledge uncertainties in the macro environment and plan the business prudently. Starting with the full-year 2024. We now expect revenue to be in the range $10.375 billion to $10.475 billion. This range represents growth of 8% to 9% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 6% to 7%. Also relating to Q4, we are assuming a negative impact of approximately 3 percentage points resulting from a shorter holiday shopping season relative to last year. We continue to expect to open 35 to 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024 and complete approximately 40 co-located optimization. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2024 will include five to 10 stores in the Americas with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland. For the full-year, we now expect gross margin to be approximately 20 basis points below our adjusted gross margin in 2023, due prominently to deleverage on fixed costs associated with lower forecasted sales and an increase in freight costs relative to our prior estimates. We continue to expect markdowns to be relatively flat with last year. Turning now to SG&A for the full-year. We now expect it to be approximately flat versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our Power of Three x2 roadmap, including investments in marketing and brand building and at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. When looking at operating margin for the full year 2024, we now expect a decrease of 10 to 20 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. For the full-year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $13.95 to $14.15 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases but does include the impact of our repurchases year-to-date. From looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to increase in the mid-teens in Q3 as we begin to anniversary last year's decline. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. This spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Shifting now to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $2.34 billion to $2.365 billion, representing growth of 6% to 7%. We expect to open 14 net new company-operated stores in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to decrease 50 to 60 basis points relative to Q3 2023. The decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in our multiyear distribution center project. We expect product margin to be relatively flat with last year, inclusive of approximately 60 basis points of higher freight costs. We expect markdowns to be relatively flat with Q3 2023. In Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage by 40 to 50 basis points relative to Q3 2023. This will be driven predominantly by leverage on top line and ongoing prudent expense management. When looking at operating margin for Q3, we expect deleverage of approximately 10 to 20 basis points. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.73 versus adjusted EPS of $2.53 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be approximately 30%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. lululemon remains a strong and healthy brand, and we have shown our ability to responsibly manage the business while seizing the many growth opportunities in front of us. We have a strong track record and we will continue to work to deliver for our shareholders, for our employees and for our guests. Challenges are a natural part of accelerated growth, and I feel confident about emerging stronger from this period as we innovate for and inspire our guests. In closing, I want to thank our leaders and our people for their passion and dedication to our brand and our business, both during this past quarter and with all bets ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. And I appreciate all the color, Calvin. Maybe larger picture, what do you see as the revenue growth algorithm in North America once the dust settles, and I think you talked about color sizing, some near-term execution. And I think you cited all of this as more or less optimal on the women's side by the spring. So maybe what do you see as the right revenue growth algorithm in North America once the dust is settled? And then what guardrails have you put into place to drive greater consistency over time in the region? Meghan Frank : Matt. So in terms of how we view North America growth over time, we're still committed to our Power of Three x2 plan, which had North America low double-digit growth. What I would share where -- it's too soon to put a fine point on 2025. But what I would share is that we'll obviously be up against an easier comparison this year. And we still are excited about the long-term growth opportunity we have in that market, particularly in terms of U.S. in terms of brand awareness. So we have continue to protect investments that are aimed at building into that long-term opportunity. Calvin McDonald : Yes, Matt, in terms of the second part, the new product or organization definitely sets a new balance between, as I mentioned, design and merchandising, which is going to lead to more creative conversations and outcomes. And I've been in these meetings with the teams and already, we're seeing the benefit of the new working relationships. And definitely clarity around the ratio of newness tied to our product plans are a key part of that conversation and excited about the road map ahead to deliver on those. And the opportunities we see in product and delivering on our guest needs. Matthew Boss : Great. And then Meghan, maybe just a follow-up. If you could just speak to your comfort with inventory on hand today exiting the quarter. And maybe just touch on markdowns relative to plan in the second quarter or any change for the back half? Meghan Frank : So in terms of inventory, we came in with inventory down 14%. It was in line with expectations. And just a reminder, we're lapping some increases the last couple of years in terms of inventory, with turns still slightly slower than history. As we move into the second half of the year, we do expect inventory to be in the mid-teens at the end of Q3 and a similar growth rate, slightly higher as we end the year. I would say in terms of comfort with inventory, pleased with where we came in, in line with expectations. The opportunity would be in composition and that mixture that Calvin described in terms of newness, which the team is adjusting now. And then in terms of markdowns, we did come in favorable relative to our expectations in Q2. So we did expect to see markdowns similar -- slightly below what we saw in Q1. We were up 50 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We expected slightly lower in Q2. We did come in flat year-over-year. And that was really driven by strong sell-throughs on seasonal, which is where we really take markdowns just to clear seasonal goods. When we look at the second half of the year, Q3 markdowns, I'd expect relatively in line with last year and then Q4 slightly under last year, and we're still expecting flat markdowns for the full year. Matthew Boss : Great color. Best of luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alex Straton : Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just on the revised full year guidance and where it's coming out of, it feels like that's mostly concentrated in the fourth quarter. Is that right? Or did your view on the third quarter change as well? And if you could just walk us through the puts and takes for looks like almost a $0.50 reduction, that would be very helpful. Thanks a lot. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Alex. I would say the -- our view on the relationship between Q3 and Q4 have not changed. I would say we are guiding the second half in line essentially with the trend we're seeing in Q2. Q4 is adjusted for the shorter holiday selling period and days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which we estimate at about a three point impact as well as the macroeconomic environment and the election in Q4. So the relationship with the two quarters has not changed, but we have lowered our outlook on the aggregate water line for the second half. Alex Straton : Got it. Maybe just one for Calvin. How much do you attribute sort of the revenue shortcoming in the quarter versus your expectation to like your own mistakes versus the macro, there's been a lot of discussion of kind of a weakening consumer. So just curious your thoughts on that. Calvin McDonald : I definitely see this as an opportunity based on decisions that we made that are within our control and being addressed. As I alluded to, it's across the globe that really is focused to our U.S. women's business and the gap in newness that we brought across color, print and silhouettes. The newness we had sold very well. Guest was coming in traffic was positive across all channels and the opportunity was in conversion. So I see that as an opportunity that they were there with intent to spend, and there was a noticeable reduction in those historical levels of newness. So those were the product decisions that we made earlier and the new teams in action. And as I alluded to the chase, but definitely, I think majority is within our control. Alex Straton : Thanks a lot. Good luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead. Paul Lejuez : Hey guys. Thanks. Can you talk about how the quarter progressed as you move through by region? What the exit rates were? Any comments on quarter-to-date, and are there any pockets of higher inventory. Just curious how you handle the whole Breathe Through, where the product goes, any financial impact on the back half? Thanks. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Paul. So in terms of Q2, our May trend relatively in line with what we experienced in Q1 and then a softer business performance in June and July, with July being slightly above June. We haven't given any color by region within that. But I would say in terms of quarter-to-date, we don't break down quarter-to-date performance by month. But -- and given what we experienced in Q2, the macroeconomic uncertainty in the second half of the year, we feel our guide at 6% to 7% as appropriate at this time. And then in terms of inventory, again, comfortable with the overall level, and Breathe Through, really negligible impact, a small test and learn and not a material financial impact. Paul Lejuez : Thanks, good luck. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions here. I guess maybe one for each, Meghan, can you just walk us through how the mechanics of the P&L work? I know you do a lot of scenario planning that you could keep the EBIT margins for the total company positive while we have this slower near-term run rate in the U.S. And then, Calvin, just some of the comments you made earlier, example -- I'm wondering if you could give us an example of how design and merchandising teams are previously not on that equal footing that you think they are on now and how that impacted the strategy in the consumer's eyes. Maybe just some of what prompted you to make some of the changes in the org chart that you did? Meghan Frank : So in terms of P&L management, we're obviously closely monitoring business. We do run multiple scenarios. Our intention is to stay agile based on the way business is unfolding. As we're looking at this year and our revenue outlook, we are continuing to invest behind international performance, key to our long-term strategy in an area of our business that's currently performing well. And then as I mentioned, we also do see long-term opportunity. Our outlook has not changed on long-term opportunity in terms of brand awareness globally, but also within North America. So we've continued to protect investments in that long-term brand building. At the same time, we're looking for efficiency opportunities across the P&L and discretionary spend buckets, as well as slowing down where that makes sense in terms of our capabilities, road mapping go forward, all in line with our Power of Three times Two plan. So feel like we're well positioned as we navigate this year with the right balance of navigating the short term while protecting investments in our long-term. Calvin McDonald : And Michael, in terms of your question, as you know, the previous structure, both design and merchandising rolled up to a single leader. And that product organization had served us well as a high-growth company. We have a 24% CAGR over the last five years, from '18 to '23 to $10 billion in revenue. But as we look forward, we saw it as an opportunity to reset and take a different approach. And what the new org does by having a stronger balance between design and merch, which will lead to more creative conversations and outcomes and in those conversations and the meetings I will have. So where am I seeing the difference in balance? You will see it executed in creation of some product, challenging of the ratio between newness and core in the assortment and just the relationship between those two teams in terms of what's being created and how we're mixing it into the assortment and then bringing to market. So also with this change, we're seeing a much tighter relationship in the brand/marketing organization with merchandising, which is really the whole sell side of the business being under one leader where before it was a hand off. Those conversations are happening much sooner and aligned in terms of where we see the opportunity, aligning it to what we're buying deep into and then creating plans for that demand creation earlier in the process. So I think there's really 3 benefits that are coming out of it on the brand to merchandising sell side as well as design and seeing it in terms of just the creation of product and that ratio mix across the assortment that the guest has been looking for and excited to bring. Michael Binetti : Okay. Thanks a lot for all the information. I appreciate guys. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Janine Stichter with BTIG. Please go ahead. Janine Stichter : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. A couple of questions on the product innovation for the back half. I guess first on Breathe Through, it seems to us that the consumer really likes the fabric. They just weren't in love with the fit. What's the time line for getting that back with some new fits and silhouettes? And then any parameters you can help provide around some of these new launches coming in the back half. It seems like the launch in training, it seems like that will be pretty big. Just how to think about that in terms of the size and potential impact? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Janine. In terms of Breathe Through and the fabric, you're right. We're really excited about the guest response, not just in North America, but actually internationally, in particular, in our APAC market, where this fabric was really designed, as I shared, for hot yoga, but we see it as versatility in high humid environment for a variety of activities. So it is a very unique, exciting new fabric for us and the teams in work to bring it back in either a style that the guest already knows with the new fabric versus the sharper design lines that it was introduced in. So we got the read we wanted in that the fabric, which is the real innovation behind it, landed and resonated very well. And they're working on being able to bring that back to market. You won't see it in '24 and not calling it for '25, but know that that's a prior to the team, but they're equally looking on all the other innovation and creating as well. So you alluded to a lot is happening within our training category. We have the Wunder Under, which is a known silhouette style that we're bringing with some new fabrics that we're excited about. We do have a new performance trained legging coming at the end of the year, which equally is innovative, and we'll get a read on it. But as I shared, we introduced these. We adjust. It is a new innovation in fabric. We're very excited about it, and we'll get the guests' read, but we'll introduce that. And then we have some seasonal updates, which is a big part of the newness, which has been missing in the first half, is newness on our core styles that the guests resonate so much with. And we're seeing a lot of seasonal updates to our number one franchise being in line. So there's a lot of newness coming in as well as innovation on top of some known silhouettes and franchises that we're excited about. Janine Stichter : Thanks for the color. And best of luck. Operator : The next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thanks, good afternoon. I know you said that it won't be until spring 2025 to get back to the historic levels of newness. But can you ramp that at all in the second half by accelerating orders? And does the guidance include any benefit from accelerating newness in the women's assortment in the coming quarters? Calvin McDonald : In terms of the action plan that we put in place and the teams have been working on that as I alluded to, I think coming out of Q1, we saw some opportunity. The learning in Q2 was the missed opportunity in silhouettes, which was new news for us as we continue to analyze the business. And the teams through that action plan of chase has been pulling forward and going into deeper on inventory that had been purchased that we're seeing the guests respond well to as well as fast tracking some designs. The chasing into will sequentially get stronger, and we will see that improve through Q3 into Q4. As I alluded to, I think spring '25, we know we'll be at our historical levels of newness as a mix of assortment and it will sequentially get better through the back half of this year, and I'll let Meghan speak in terms of the tie to guidance. Meghan Frank : So in terms of guidance, we did guide the second half in line with Q2 when adjusting for that shorter holiday selling period. So I would say we don't have any meaningful impact from newness in the second half of the year. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Please go ahead. Dana Telsey : Hi, as you think about your inventory positioning for the back half of the year, how do you break apart the third quarter and the fourth quarter? And with the Breathe Through, which was a small launch that you talked about, Calvin, is there any markdowns or any resets on the inventory numbers or gross margin impact of taking that down and eliminating it? Thank you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Dana. So in terms of inventory in Q3, we're expecting a mid-teens increase in Q4 at or slightly above that level and feel well positioned as we move into the second half of the year. As Calvin mentioned, we will be ramping newness as we move throughout that second half period and be back at historical levels by spring 2025. In terms of Breathe Through, is a very small test and learn. So an immaterial negligible impact on both Q2 and then our guidance for the balance of the year. So nothing notable there. Operator : The next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking our question. Calvin, I was hoping you could speak to the trends that you saw in your U.S. women's business by demographic or consumer type. Has the change in conversion that you've seen year-to-date over indexed to any one age group or household income? And as you look to increase the level of newness over the next few quarters, do you see any specific opportunities to adapt your marketing and membership organization to better serve customers by demographic? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brooke. In terms of the guest profile, nothing meaningful in that we continue to grow our new guest base and continue to do it across the age demographics that we have been growing. What we did see in the conversion missed opportunity, a lot was with our existing guests across those age demographics where the guest who knows our brand, who's come in and was looking for that newness to add to their already owned collection of lululemon and the gap in newness on color of those core items, on pattern and trim, newness to those core items or to some of the new silhouettes that we just add and introduced around to style around those core, those gaps is where we saw that missed opportunity. So she's still spending, visiting we just missed the opportunity in that full conversion from what we've seen and directly linked to decisions we made and missed in that newness and opportunity, but still growing on the gas base, still growing across the age demographic and as I alluded to an opportunity. Going forward, from a marketing perspective, because we still see very good engagement, low unaided awareness. We're definitely marketing and continue to go after that. And as the product mix gets stronger in our women's as a percentage of newness, we know that conversion is what we'll be looking at and engaging that guest in terms of their spend. But I alluded to the current men's campaign or lounge campaign, really, it's for both him and her. We're very pleased with the early results. It starts to really increase in terms of exposure in through September. But early indication, particular in men's where we have those new franchises of soft jersey, smooth cover, steady state. He's responding very well to it. So we're going to continue to drive top-of-funnel drive an unaided brand awareness. And we know that the strength of bringing in the newness will be the biggest lever for us, and we'll continue to increase that throughout the back half of this year and into next. Brooke Roach : Okay. Thanks so much. I will pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Altschwager : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping if you could provide a bit more perspective on China. Clearly, some -- still very strong growth rates there. But I think about a 10-point comp slowdown against an easier comparison. How should we think about sustainable comp growth rates there? I think others have talked about some more macro consumer pressure because you're feeling that as well. Any color on what's going on in stores and digital, maybe just more broadly, how you're planning comp growth by region for the remainder of the year? Thank you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Mark. So we did still see very strong growth in China in Q2, so up 37% on a constant currency basis. The variance between Q1 and Q2 growth rates, the biggest factor would have been the shift in Chinese New Year. So we had that in Q1 2024. In 2022, it was in Q4, so it's not comparable. So really healthy growth there across both channels. And we haven't broken out our forward-looking guide by region, but I would say still outsized growth in international and China being the key driver there. Calvin McDonald : And I'll just add, we remain excited about the potential for lululemon in Mainland China. While we're keeping an eye on the macro environment in the region, our business remains strong. And we believe several factors will continue to benefit us. One, it is still a small size relative to the market with a store base of 132 on the Mainland at the end of the quarter. We take a very localized approach to the brand, building relationships through local fitness instructors, influencers, some very unique events that are building awareness in the community on the back of our unique positioning, grounded in wellness and the positioning of the product. So we're monitoring it, have not seen any material impact to the business. And I do believe it's because we're very early in our growth there and see a lot of continuous success across the Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where we've been opening, testing and seeing very good response. Mark Altschwager : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Rick Patel : Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the performance of core products. You called out a lack of inventory for certain styles and sizes entering the year, did the same headwinds intensify in the second quarter or did you see new headwinds related to other products? Just some clarity there would be great. And then secondly, you're seeing -- still seeing good growth for accessories. How should we think about the outlook there? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Rick. In terms of the shift from Q1 to Q2 and learning, color, print and pattern continues to be an opportunity for us. And we think of those through a couple of ways in which we execute it. One is core styles and adding it through updates through color, print, silhouettes, fabric extensions. That has been a great driver for us to keep our guests engaged and keep adding to the lululemon products for them as well as seasonal new silhouettes and styles. And I would say the shift from Q1 to Q2 is -- the gap in that as a percentage historically was greater in Q2 than in Q1 and was really the notable difference between the two quarters. Sorry, Rick. And on accessories, I think we've chatted about this before, Everywhere Belt Bag was a very strong driver for us in the last few years. And we've cycled over some of the peaks of that volume, but it continues to be a big driver. And as you mentioned, overall accessories in the quarter grew 7%, and the team continues to introduce new styles, both within the Everywhere Belt Bag franchise but new styles from our backpack collection to some travel bags to totes to the cactus leather introduction this week that the guests responded very well too. So we continue to be very excited about our accessories business. It's small percentage of our overall mix at 10, but definitely a significant opportunity. We're about 1% of market share, and we see opportunity to continue to grow that meaningfully moving forward. And the team is doing it through creating very innovative products and the guests continue to respond very well to it in North America as well as globally. So excited about the product creation and what's coming. Rick Patel : Great. Thank you. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : The last question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. John Kernan : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Meghan, I think a big fear of price into the valuation of the company right now is the gross margin rate has peaked and your SG&A rate may need to move higher. How would you address those fears given the competitive environment in the category right now? Meghan Frank : Yes, so I think we continue to see strength in both gross margin and SG&A. This year with our revenue growth guide at 8% to 9% and then 6% to 7%, excluding the 53rd week, we're still delivering gross margin relatively in line with 2023 and as well as approximately flat SG&A. Our operating margin still very strong, 100 basis points above our 2020 results after two years. So we're really focused on driving into that bottom line and optimizing the bottom line. We're still committed to our Power of Three times Two plan for modest operating margin expansion over the five-year period. I think too soon to put a fine point on the outer years, but certainly have runway in front of us in terms of, most importantly, revenue, but also looking at growth and efficiencies across our P&L, and we'll continue to keep you updated. John Kernan : Understood. And then Calvin, maybe a follow-up for you. Has your core customer and women's changed over the years? It seems like it's a more diverse cohort. Are they more challenging to plan and allocate for in terms of sizing and color and what are you learning surrounding some of the new customers you've acquired? Calvin McDonald : Yes, we continue to acquire across all of our -- if you want to slice it through age demographic, I think I've mentioned in the past across different age demographics, we continue to acquire new guests across all of them. Alluded to the shift in our sizing profile earlier. I think the team is doing a good job in adjusting to that. We saw improvements through Q2 and really are entering Q3 with a better mix of sizing across our profile. We're going to continue to adjust. But I wouldn't say there's any macro shift that we're behind on now, and we continue to recruit and acquire guests across that, which means really across the age and the size profile. John Kernan : Understood. Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day.",

As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon. Please go ahead. Howard Tubin : Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Howard. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our quarter three results, which exceeded our expectations as well as our outlook for the holiday season in the fourth quarter overall. On today's call, I'll start with some highlights from Thanksgiving and Black Friday weekend. I'll then, discuss our quarter three performance, beginning with North America, and the progress we are making in our US business. Next, I'll share insights on our international business where momentum remains very strong. Then, I'll speak to product. Meghan will review our financials and guidance outlook, and we will close by taking your questions. So, let's get started. We are pleased with our business over the extended Thanksgiving weekend and the traffic trends we saw across both our store and e-commerce channels. In fact, on Black Friday, we had the most visits ever to our shop app and e-commerce site. Unlike others in this space, we do not run sale events across our entire store. We leverage the increased traffic over this period to clear through product we are not taking forward and to feature full-price style. We are happy with how the guests responded to both with full-price sales driven by some of our key franchises, including Define. While we feel good about the start of the holiday season, we still have large volume weeks in front of us. And given the shorter holiday shopping season, we continue to be thoughtful in our planning for quarter four overall. Now, looking at quarter three, total revenue increased 9%, or 8% in constant currency. By region, China Mainland increased 39%, or 36% in constant currency; the Rest of World grew 27%, or 23% in constant currency; and the Americas increased 2%. By merchandise category, men's increased 9% and women's and accessories both increased 8%. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13%. In addition, demonstrating our continued confidence in the business, our Board recently authorized $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program. In quarter three, we repurchased $409 million of stock, which brings us to $1.4 billion year-to-date. Including the additional authorization, we have $1.8 billion available to repurchase our shares. I'll now turn to the details about our quarter three, beginning with our performance by region. In the Americas, revenue increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Positive momentum continued in Canada, where revenue increased 9%. In the U.S., revenue was flat, which was consistent with our performance in quarter two and in line with our expectations. Last quarter, I laid out our plans to drive improvement in our U.S. business. These plans include implementing a new reporting structure within our product team, increasing the penetration of seasonal newness within our assortments by quarter one 2025 and chasing into updated colors, prints and patterns to provide guests with more options in the second half of this year. So, let me share the progress we are seeing. When looking at our product team, we are beginning to see the efficiencies and anticipated benefits of our new reporting structure with our Global Creative Director reporting to me and our Chief Merchandising Officer reporting to Nikki Neuburger in her expanded role as Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer. Our merchandising and brand teams are now more fully integrated, which leads to better coordination and faster decision-making regarding how we bring our innovation to life. I'm proud of how our leaders and teams pushed forward this quarter and how we have made meaningful progress in creating the product organization to drive our future success. When looking at the composition of our assortments, we are on track with our efforts to increase the penetration of seasonal newness and expect to be in line with historical levels in quarter one 2025. I feel good about the quality and quantity of newness the teams have planned and I believe we are well positioned for spring. Finally, our teams have been agile and have been chasing into seasonal colors, prints and patterns. I'm sure you've seen several examples across our key franchises. These efforts have contributed to the sequential improvement in newness within our assortment in the back half of the year. We continue to see significant potential for growth in the U.S. Our guest retention remains high and we see an opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with more newness in the assortment. We continue to grow our membership program and we are now 24 million members strong. Our variety of benefits, including early access, partner perks and members-only events are resonating well. And our unaided brand awareness remains low in the U.S. at 36%, which provides a significant opportunity for growth as we continue to open and optimize stores and launch new brand campaigns and activations. In summary, I'm pleased with our progress so far as our teams are in action to return our level of newness back to historical levels in quarter one 2025. In addition, we are benefiting from and seeing the efficiencies from the new leadership structure within our product team. With the rest of our regions performing well, I feel confident in our growth plans and strategies for 2025. Turning to our international business, momentum remains strong in all of our markets as we continue to see great acceptance of the lululemon brand across the globe. Overall, we saw international revenue increase 33%, or 30% on a constant currency basis. Here are some highlights. In China Mainland, our brand positioning of Made to Feel allows us to authentically connect with guests by offering technical product that helps enable them to live an active and healthy lifestyle and bring to life compelling activations focused on movement and well-being. This aligns well with the government's Healthy China 2030 initiative. In quarter three, our local team executed our largest activation yet, centered around World Mental Health Day and the release of our fourth annual Global Wellbeing Report. We hosted events in nine cities, anchored by our activation in Shanghai. For one week in early October, we hosted a variety of sessions for guests, including sweat sessions and experiences along the West Bund. In total, we had 15,000 guests participate in our activations across the mainland and we generated 3.8 billion impressions. I'm excited with the success and scale of this activation, one example of many from our team in China Mainland, which are intended to increase brand awareness which remains low but is growing, bring new guests into the brand and increase engagement and loyalty with existing guests. Now, let's focus on the Rest of the World segment, which is comprised of APAC and EMEA regions. We remain in the early stages of growth in these markets and have significant opportunity to expand our footprint through new store openings and expansion of key locations. In our more established international markets, we are leveraging the success of our North America optimization program. For example, in Australia, we are seeing meaningful benefits from the strategy, including an enhanced and more premium shopping experience for our guests, an increase in our men's business through additional square footage and improved visual merchandising, and an increase in online sales as these stores help attract both local guests and tourists into the brand. Our new store in the Emporium Mall in Melbourne is a terrific illustration of the effectiveness of this strategy. At 11,000 square feet, it is our largest store in APAC and is on track to be our number one store in the region in terms of revenue. We opened our first store in Australia more than 20 years ago, and this shows the growth that is possible even within our more established markets. In EMEA, we are also executing against our store optimization strategy as we recently increased the size of our stores in Berlin and Oslo, and we're happy with the performance of both. I'm thrilled with the response we are seeing from guests as we improve the shopping experience in markets where we currently operate. This is a key strategy for us across all regions, including North America, as it allows us to better position our store portfolio to support our product plans, continue to drive success in key growth categories, including men's, accessories, outerwear and footwear, and drive overall sales while continuing to deliver best-in-class store productivity. In addition to maximizing existing markets, we have significant opportunity to bring lululemon to new countries across the globe. Our plans for 2025 include opening in Italy as a new company-operated market, and in Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic under our franchise model. Let me shift now and spend a few minutes on product. In quarter three, in women's, we saw strength in shorts, skirts and leggings in seasonal colors, while in men's, guests continue to respond well to our Pace Breaker and Zeroed In franchises in performance and key lounge franchises. In accessories, bags continue to perform well, driven by backpacks and the crossbody styles. We built upon our success this past spring in golf by focusing on another play category, tennis, when we dropped our lululemon Tennis Club collection during the US Open in New York this quarter. Based on the strong guest response, we continue to see an opportunity to grow our play activities and intend to evolve our strategy from a seasonal approach to one where we introduced newness into these collections consistently throughout the year. And we have been pleased with the performance of two strategic partnerships we launched recently, Fanatics and the National Hockey League and Disney. As you are aware, we have a targeted strategic sales business where we sell product to select partners, including fitness studios and university bookstores. Our Fanatics and NHL partnership builds upon the success of our campus strategy. We know there is an opportunity to bring a premium option to sports fans, which allows them to celebrate their favorite teams through our most iconic styles. Our limited edition product collaboration with Disney combines iconic Disney imagery with our best-in-class technical apparel and taps into the appreciation guests have for both brands. As I step back and look at our entire product assortments, I'm excited with the newness we have planned. Our technical product is a key competitive advantage for us and our positioning as a premium athletic brand offering high style, high performance product truly differentiates us from others. Before I turn it over to Meghan to discuss our financials, let me say that we remain committed to delivering on our Power of Three x2 revenue target of $12.5 billion in 2026, and we remain ahead of schedule. Using our revenue guidance for 2024, which we updated today, our three-year revenue growth CAGR from 2021 through 2024 is 19%, ahead of the 15% CAGR target in our plan. The solid results this quarter show the inherent strength of our brand and highlight the continued opportunity for lululemon around the world with existing and new guests. Meghan, now over to you. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Calvin. In Q3, both revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations. Top-line strength was driven by continued momentum in our international regions and Canada, while EPS also benefited from stronger-than-expected gross margins. Looking at Q4, as Calvin mentioned, we're pleased with the results over Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the holiday season. I would also keep in mind that nearly two-thirds of the quarter remains in front of us and the macro environment remains dynamic. As such, we continue to plan the business prudently, and I'll share our detailed Q4 guidance shortly. Let me also mention that we closed on the purchase of our Mexico franchise. The transaction closed on September 10th and had an immaterial impact on our Q3 financials. However, you will see an increase of 15 stores in our company-operated store count related to Mexico. These stores were not included in our new store opening plans or square footage growth guidance for the year. Hence, they are additive. Let me now show the details of our Q3 performance. For Q3, total net revenue rose 9%, or 8% in constant currency, to $2.4 billion, and constant dollar comparable sales increased 3%. Within our regions, results were as follows : Americas revenue increased 2% with a comparable sales decline of 2%; China Mainland revenue increased 39%, or 36% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 24%; and in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 27%, or 23% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing by 20%. In our store channel, total sales increased 13% and we ended the quarter with 749 stores globally. Square footage increased 16% versus last year, driven by the addition of 63 net new lululemon stores since Q3 of 2023. During the quarter, we opened 13 net new stores and completed 14 optimizations. In addition, as I mentioned, we added 15 stores in Mexico, which are included in the 63 net new stores and 16% square footage growth metrics. In our digital channel, revenue increased 4% and contributed $945 million of top-line, or 39% of total revenue. And by category, men's revenue increased 9% versus last year, while women's and accessories both increased 8%. Gross profit for the third quarter was $1.4 billion or 58.5% of net revenue compared to adjusted gross margin of 58.1% in Q3 2023. The adjusted gross profit rate in Q3 increased 40 basis points, ahead of our guidance, and was driven primarily by the following : a 50-basis-point increase in product margin, driven by lower inventory provision expense versus last year and favorable IMU, offset by higher freight costs; markdowns were flat year-over-year; 20 basis points of net deleverage on fixed costs; and 10 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Relative to our guidance, which was for a decline in gross margin of 50 basis points to 60 basis points, the upside was driven predominantly by prudent management of fixed expenses within gross margin, better IMU, lower DC operating costs and the timing of expenses related to certain store real estate projects. Moving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $910 million, or 38% of net revenue compared to 38.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A was slightly worse than our guidance of 40 basis points to 50 basis points of leverage due to approximately 20 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $491 million, or 20.5% of net revenue, compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.8% in Q3 2023. Tax expense for the quarter was $153 million or 30.2% of pre-tax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $352 million or $2.87 per diluted share compared to adjusted EPS of $2.53 for the third quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $178 million for the quarter compared to approximately $163 million in the third quarter last year. Q3 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory increased 8%, lower than our guidance for an increase in the mid-teens. We repurchased 1.58 million shares in Q3 at an average price of $259. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of stock. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, and we currently have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on a repurchase program, including the recent $1 billion increase in authorization. Let me now share our detailed guidance outlook for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our performance at the start of the holiday season, but given fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and an uncertain macro environment, we continue to plan the business prudently. Starting with full year 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $10.452 billion to $10.487 billion. This range represents growth of 9% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow 7%. I'd also note that our revenue range now includes an incremental $20 million of negative impact related to recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We expect to open approximately 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024, excluding Mexico, and complete approximately 40 co-located optimizations. Excluding Mexico, we expect square footage to grow in the low-double-digits, and including Mexico, we expect overall square footage growth in the low-teens. Our new store openings in 2024 will include approximately 10 stores in the Americas, inclusive of two company-operated stores in Mexico in Q4. With the rest of our openings planned in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to increase approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points versus our adjusted gross margin in 2023. We continue to expect markdowns to be relatively flat with last year. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We now expect it to be 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our Power of Three x2 roadmap, including investments in marketing and brand building aimed at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. When looking at operating margin for the full year 2024, we continue to expect a decrease of 10 basis points to 20 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.08 to $14.16 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases, but does include the impact of our repurchases year-to-date. When looking at inventory, we continue to expect dollar inventory to increase in the mid-teens in Q4. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. The spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation for a multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Shifting now to Q4. We expect revenue in the range of $3.475 billion to $3.51 billion, representing growth of 8% to 10%, or 3% to 4% excluding the 53rd week. This range includes the incremental negative $20 million impact from foreign exchange I previously mentioned. We expect to open 18 net new company operated stores in Q4, including two in Mexico. Expect gross margin in Q4 to decrease 20 basis points to 30 basis points relative to Q4 2023. The decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in store growth and our multiyear distribution center project. We expect product margin to increase 60 basis points to 70 basis points, inclusive of approximately 40 basis points of higher freight costs. We continue to expect markdowns to be slightly improved versus Q4 2023. In Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 90 basis points to 100 basis points relative to Q4 2023. This will be driven predominantly by increased foundational investments and related depreciation and also strategic investments, including those to build brand awareness to support future growth. When looking at operating margin for Q4, we expect deleverage of approximately 110 basis points to 130 basis points. Turning to EPS, we expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.64 versus adjusted EPS of $5.29 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 29.5%. And with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Meghan. As you can see from our results, our business continues to deliver across our international markets and we are pleased with the start to the holiday season in North America. Looking ahead, we are excited about the work underway across our product organization to create the pipeline of newness that guests expect from us, both in the near and long term. And as we build our brand awareness and continue to strategically expand globally, the opportunities in front of us are significant. As we head into the final weeks of the year, I want to thank our teams around the world who made these results possible. I continue to be impressed by the agility and resilience of our teams who demonstrate why lululemon is one of the enduring growth stories within retail. Thank you all for joining us. Meghan and I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alex Straton : Perfect. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on U.S. sales. It looks like they stabilized on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So, I'm just curious, do you view this kind of as a bottom for that geography and should it improve from here? And maybe thoughts on the longer-term growth rate of that business? Thanks a lot. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Alex. In terms of quarter three as you mentioned, performance was what we had expected in our plan on our newness was equally on our expectations. In Q4, our newness is getting sequentially stronger. And as mentioned, we're off to a good start the holiday and happy with our regular price performance over the Thanksgiving weekend. We continue to see good response to newness from our guests and we're on plan to hit that historical number by quarter one. And when I look at our guests, I'm happy with the absolute growth number. Our retention with our guests remains very strong, and the opportunity remains, as I've spoken to in the past, revenue per guest related to newness. And when I look at brand awareness and our opportunities of category expansion, we still see growth in the U.S. market and know that it's within our control and focused on the product decisions and that's what the team is focused on. And in terms of our Power of Three x2 growth guidance numbers and our view of North America, nothing has changed. Alex Straton : Thanks a lot. Good luck. Operator : The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Meghan, can you talk about the reasons for the mid-teens inventory growth in the fourth quarter? How much of this is holding on to slower moving core versus chasing seasonal color and pattern? And how are you planning inventory for the first half of '25? Meghan Frank : Thanks, Lorraine. So, we came in at plus-8% at the end of Q3. We actually guided to the mid-teens for inventory, and our view on Q4 hasn't changed. We're expecting to end Q4 in the mid-teens growth rate. I would say over the longer term, we aim to manage inventory in line with our sales growth. We are chasing into seasonal newness. So, definitely it's impacting, I would say, our growth rate at the end of the year to set us up for our goal of inflecting the business and specifically the U.S. as we move into the first half of next year. As you -- if you look at our inventory turns, they're pretty much in line with history, a little bit slower than history actually. So, we feel well positioned as we move into Q4 and then into '25 as well. Operator : The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ike Boruchow : Hi. Good afternoon. Let me add my congrats. Calvin, maybe just to piggyback on Alex's question, just comps are still negative, which is obviously not ideal, but your tone and your confidence on the trajectory of what's going on in the region sounds better. It sounds like the confidence is building. So, maybe can you just maybe unpack some of the KPIs or whatever it is you look at that can kind of help us understand exactly why we should be confident that the negative comp trend will in fact inflect come next spring? Calvin McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Ike. It -- the confidence is rooted in a few of the key data points that I have shared. I'll point to a guest who is still very engaged with our brand, remain very loyal and are reacting very well to the newness that the teams are delivering. And we know that, that newness as a percentage of our overall assortment and mix is below our historical levels. So, when we see the newness, he and she is responding well to it. And seeing the work the team has been doing, the quality and quantity of that newness as a mix of our core assortment heading into Q1 of next year and through 2025 is where I get the confidence that we're back at those historical levels that we have a guest that's still very much engaged in the brand and, quite frankly, is waiting for us to hit those historical levels and we're seeing that through their spending pattern. Our overall guest growth has been strong. I'm pleased with it. We now have over 24 million members in our Essential membership program, and we're continuing to see a very good matriculation per our plan of our younger recently acquired guests. And then, it's the core guest that the team is very much focused on who's responding, but waiting for us to bring that newness so she can continue to add to her lululemon collection. That's what gives me the confidence. I truly believe that decisions made with our product and we are addressing it with the new structure, the talent, the new talent and the team and feel good with what I see heading into '25. Ike Boruchow : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Janine Stichter with BTIG. Please go ahead. Janine Stichter : Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. I want to ask a bit more on the women's business. It picked up nicely from Q2. Maybe a little bit more about what's going on there? And then, I think you called out leggings, which is the first time we've heard that as a positive call in a while. So, just would love some more color around what's going on within the legging business and what we can expect for Q4 into next year. Thank you. Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Janine. Our women's business globally, and I'll start globally, is performing very well, as is our men's, as well as our accessories business, really balanced growth globally. And we continue to see in all of our international markets growth across all the categories, including our bottoms and our leggings business. In North America, particularly in the U.S., because we saw very strong growth in Canada, the women's business, and when we look at newness, again, we saw good growth. It's the missed historical levels of newness where we see that opportunity. When we look at the legging business, the bottom business and how she responded to newness through color, prints and pattern, she responds very well. And we did gain share in both men's and women's globally as well as in the U.S. in the premium activewear category. So, we know that she is responding well to that newness and that's what the team is focused on to continue to bring, but we are seeing growth across those categories. And I just want to remind that when we talk newness, it is colors on top of our core colors and core franchises. It's not unseen, unproven newness. We do bring that in as a percentage of our overall assortment, but a lot of what drives the newness and our guest responds to is the franchises, the silhouettes and the hero items that he and she loves, but bringing it through different colors and prints and trims and other ways in which we are adding newness to those that have always been a good driver of our business and we've been at lower than historical levels, and that's what the team is focused on in driving. Janine Stichter : Thanks so much and good luck for holiday. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just a quick one on the model. It looks like one of the key drivers of the gross margin in third quarter was lower inventory provisions. Would you just remind us how influential that could be in the fourth quarter? And then maybe just a little -- stepping back a little bit on the gross margin, unpacking a little bit more, maybe what's under the surface on the product margin? I think you said one of the big pieces there, Meghan, was upside to the guidance was good control of fixed costs on the product side. Is that -- I'm curious how sustainable that is with the high fixed cost base in North America and the negative comps in that market. Is that something that's as controllable in the fourth quarter, or is there something unique to third quarter that let that be a bigger lever for you while the comps remain negative in your biggest market? Meghan Frank : Great. Thanks, Michael. In terms of inventory provisions, we provided for some inventory that sold through in the quarter and we've released some provisions, we're also lapping a higher comparison last year, we're not expecting to see big movement year-over-year in inventory provision specifically when we move to Q4. If we look at what drove our Q3 margin, 50 basis points was from product margin, it was from the lower provisions, as you mentioned. We saw some benefit in higher IMU, partially offset by higher freight and the markdowns were flat. We did have a little bit of deleverage on fixed costs and then a little bit of a favorability on FX, the 10 -- 20-basis-points deleverage on fixed costs, 10-basis-points favorable on FX. When we look at Q4, we guided to a decrease of 20 basis points to 30 basis points. In that, we are expecting a benefit in product margin of about 50 basis points to 60 basis points of markdown slightly under last year and then offset partially by some deleverage on fixed costs with store growth in DC, specifically on a little bit of a lower revenue trend. Michael Binetti : Thank you very much. Meghan Frank : Thanks, Michael. Operator : The next question is from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. John Kernan : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. We were all over in China or most of us were over there with you back in October. Can you talk to what you're seeing on the ground in China both from a top-line and margin perspective? I think in the first half of the year, the China segment contribution margin was in line with America. I was just wondering, how you're planning it for the back half of the year. Meghan Frank : Yeah. Thanks, John. So, we've been really pleased and continue to be pleased with our China performance. So, our China Mainland growth on a constant currency basis was 37% in Q2, 36% in Q3, and we saw a positive impact from a bottom-line perspective. We are seeing really healthy operating margin expansion with revenue exceeding our expectations to a degree. I think as I've mentioned before, it's not a region where we're looking right now to optimize operating margin, really focused on driving our long-term trend, but certainly see opportunity there over the longer term. And I think we'll put a finer point on how we see the regions playing out as we get into March and then 2025. And then, I would share, we continue to be pleased with our China trends as we move into Q4 and we do expect that we're not offering specific guidance by region, China to be above 30% growth rate again in the quarter. John Kernan : Got it. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the Rest of World. It sounds like you're more confident in store openings in some new markets. Maybe talk to some of the investments you're making there and the confidence you have in those markets. Calvin McDonald : Yeah. On -- as I mentioned, plan for next year, which will be an owned market is Italy. And then, on the success of some of the markets with our franchise model, we'll be opening Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and Czech Republic through our franchise model and partnerships. And it really is the confidence we have in the brand momentum in every market we're in globally. And we continue to monitor markets and look for opportunities to expand. We look for readiness in terms of obviously spending power, but also interest within the activities that we play into. So that's sort of sweat readiness in these markets. And we know we're early in the markets we're in, both in terms of awareness and market share and we want to continue to fuel and drive those. But these are markets that have definitely -- we've seen a nice progression in readiness for our business and our brand and want to continue to add to our international portfolio and build on that momentum we're seeing. As you know, I've spoken to, our international business is performing incredibly well in every market. We're getting pulled into markets versus pushing ourselves into, and it's still a low percentage of our overall mix of revenue. And we're excited about continuing to drive it, grow it and see it representing a much greater percentage, the overall revenue of the company, and these market growth are just addition to that momentum that we see coming in '25 and beyond. John Kernan : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So, Calvin, could you elaborate maybe on the cadence of traffic in North America as the third quarter progressed and into holiday? And maybe just speak to new customer acquisition and also the start to holiday internationally? Meghan Frank : In terms of traffic trends throughout the quarter, we don't actually disclose monthly traffic. But I'd say overall there, Matt, we were pleased globally with traffic across both channels. And in terms of the U.S. specifically, e-com channel remains positive and our stores were slightly lower than last year, but the U.S. did come in overall in line with our expectations for Q3. And as Calvin mentioned earlier, guest retention continues to be strong. The opportunity remains in revenue for guests as well as conversion, and we've been pleased with the holiday period. Calvin McDonald : Yeah. I'll just add, I know it's been a few calls since we shared the membership number. And I'll remind you that 24 million membership base, that is just North America. So, we're really excited in terms of that number and that initiative as a driver of guest engagement retention. We've recently added membership perks to it using some of our third-party partners and studio players. So, we're excited about continuing to build that out to drive engagement, loyalty and retention or being an additional factor. But guest growth in the U.S. and North America and obviously, internationally has been good this year, and we're very pleased with that. And internationally, holiday, in general, for us, we're pleased with the start. It's early. There's still a lot of the quarter ahead, and we're on a shortened holiday period, but pleased with the start, pleased with the mix between markdowns and regular prices. As you know, we really drive and we'll always drive our business through regular price through newness and innovation. Markdowns, we use as a means to clear out end of season, but pleased with the results and arguably a promotional period. I think it just shows the way the brand resonates, the way newness resonates with our guests and how we continue to build a premium brand and allow our unique differentiated product. And that's resonating around the world, and we're pleased with the start to the holiday. Matthew Boss : Great. And then, Meghan, just what's your confidence in your modest annual operating margin expansion target multiyear? Or is there a way to think about areas of expense flexibility relative to different revenue scenarios? Meghan Frank : Yeah. I mean, I would say we're deep in planning for '25. Too early to put a fine point on that. We still remain committed to our modest operating margin target over the five-year time horizon. We'll obviously come back in March and share more and certainly is revenue dependent. The team is really focused and energized on driving the inflection into '25. And I think we're pleased with our results this year despite revenues being lower than we expected. We've done quite a bit of management of expenses and managed operating margin pretty much in line with last year. So, pleased with where we're ending up. Matthew Boss : Great. Best of luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. I think you mentioned e-com in the U.S. was still positive. Stores, you said, were lower. Can you talk about that e-com versus store dynamic in your other key regions? And then, second, can you also talk about the competitive landscape, what you saw in terms of promotions out there during the third quarter and what you expect for 4Q? Thanks. Meghan Frank : Yeah. So, in terms of traffic, that was specific to the U.S., my color. I would say overall, traffic trends, both positive in the Rest of World in terms of e-com and stores. Calvin McDonald : Yeah, Paul. And in terms of the overall promotional intensity, I think it's -- we know it's a very promotional period, more intense than throughout the year. From a year-over-year perspective, I don't think the overall market is any more intense. There's pockets where certain brands and retailers are more promotional and where others are less. I think it obviously depends on the momentum in their business coming in of how they've chosen to play that. But when I look at the premium athletic space, we've continued to play a non-promotional markdown-only reg price business unlike others within this space and pleased to see the results to kick off the holiday and the way the guest responds to our product. Paul Lejuez : Thanks. Meghan, just on the e-com versus stores, can you just frame which are outperforming in your major regions? Meghan Frank : We haven't broken down the specific regions in terms of traffic by e-com and stores. Paul Lejuez : Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good afternoon. I guess I'm curious, given the election paradigm in the U.S., how you're thinking about any potential tariff impact as it relates to next year? And if you think you're a better or worse positioned than your peers on the dynamic? Meghan Frank : Hey, Sharon. So, we've obviously been closely monitoring, and early to say what will come to fruition. But I can share, we have very limited exposure in China. It's approximately -- we source approximately 3% of goods from China. So, exposure there is relatively small. Our sourcing from Mexico is less than [0.5 percentage point] (ph), and we don't source anything from Canada. So, also a very small exposure there as well. So, I would expect those are probably under some of the competitive landscape. And then, obviously, if tariffs were levied on imports from all countries into the U.S., that would obviously have a more significant impact on our costs. We are closely monitoring, and we'll look at opportunities across our P&L to manage through that as well. Operator : The next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good afternoon. I too like to add my congratulations on a nice quarter. Meghan Frank : Thank you. Brian Nagel : The question I have, I know it's going to be a little bit repetitive, so I apologize. We're talking a lot about newness, particularly as you look towards early '25. So, is there a way to quantify -- I mean as you think about what the product -- particularly domestically, what the product is going to look like in early '25, I mean how different it's going to be than what you've had historically? So, just maybe quantify better this newness dynamic. And then, along those same lines, where you have introduced new products already, could you quantify how much better the sales have been there versus, say, a baseline? Calvin McDonald : Thanks, Brian. We don't share the absolute number, but I had indicated in terms of the internal views that we look at. So, when I reference newness, as a percentage of our overall merchandising mix, that could be a combination of core with different colors, different patterns and print. It could be new franchises, hero items that we've introduced that we plan to carry forward. Good examples, Zeroed In, Soft Jersey to name a few. Or it could be items that we just sprinkle in on the season to just sort of provide that unpredictable. And some of those can be tested and learned for future seasons. The bulk of newness is still in that new innovative hero items or franchises as well as color pattern print extensions of core. So, when we look at it from a -- and that's why our markdown management is something we're able to continue to do because this is building upon the items that the consumer knows, but giving them through silhouettes and other ways, reasons to purchase. We have been below those historical numbers as a percentage of our mix through much of this year. It's sequentially getting stronger and come Q1 of next year, we'll be back at those historical levels. Although I'm not sharing a number with you, if it's to say, what would I see when I come into the store, I would say the mix of the assortment will feel more historically '23, '22 and previous years, because that's what the team is working to as a ratio. Obviously, breadth of color, and as I mentioned, across those. So, those are the parameters that we look at internally, and I think that's what you should expect to see. When you go into our store today versus when you go into our store in the quarter is back to that historical mixture of color and the other items that I've described of how we think of newness across color, but also truly newer just in and out for the season. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful, Calvin. And then just -- what you're seeing now? Because I think you have mentioned that clearly, like you just said, the bigger shift of newness is going to happen early next year, but you've had some new product now. How is this product performing? Calvin McDonald : Yeah. No, as I mentioned, we are very pleased and seeing a good guest response to the newness that we put in. It is still below our historical levels. But if you were to go into the stores today or look online some of the holiday items that we bring in, the detailing on our defined jackets or the Velvet Scuba collection, the Shine Align collection, building on the Align franchise, the Wundermost tops and the Satin Shine running tight and short are examples where we bring that, and the guest is responding very well to that, as well as in our performance with our Waffle-Knit styles across long sleeve and jogger silhouettes, tops in the Swiftly, Rulu and Restless franchises and our Fast & Free and in our footwear as well. So, there is lots of -- and those are for our women's business. And then, similar on our men's, we have the newness, and the guest is responding well to it. And as I mentioned on the Thanksgiving weekend, we saw and we're very pleased with our regular business growth in a very heavily promoted period of time. So, good response, still below historical, still below where we'll be in Q1, but throughout this year, the guest has always responded to newness. It's been the level that we've had, which has been the opportunity, and we've been addressing and chasing in all the initiatives I shared with you in terms of structure, the talent changes and the focus of the team. But that's where I get confident in what I'm seeing in Q1 as well as confident in the metrics as to what we control and what the team is focused on to drive the inflection in our women's business in the U.S. Brian Nagel : I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Howard Tubin : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. The last question is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Calvin, can you speak to your learnings on the increased investment in marketing spent this year? How should we be thinking about advertising and marketing going forward as a percent of sales as you look to expand that brand awareness? And then, perhaps as a related follow-up, wondering if you can talk to the results of the targeted strategies that you're implementing to reengage lapsed customers in the U.S. Thank you. Meghan Frank : Hey, Brooke, I'll just take the marketing spend quickly. So, we have been managing marketing essentially in line with 4.5% to 5% of sales. We do expect we'll tick up a little bit closer to 5.5% given -- this year, given we have held our marketing campaigns intact just as we've navigated the top-line pressure because we're really focused on driving into the long term there. And then, I'll have Calvin add some color here. Calvin McDonald : Yeah. In terms of the overall initiatives that we deploy the incremental investments and it really is across a lot of the levers that have driven and grown this brand, and that is in all markets, but it's including North America, in community events at the local level with our ambassador relationships in pool there and into more mid top-of-funnel initiatives as we look to acquire and keep acquiring new guests. We use ROAS as a measurement against all and most of those spends, and we're pleased, and that's why we continue to lean in. And on top-of-funnel, we're pleased with not just our new guest acquisition, but as well as the movement we've seen in all markets with our unaided brand awareness, which in the U.S. is now at 36%. So, we've continued to move that needle in a meaningful way. So, we're going to continue to sort of play and test and learn across those initiatives, leading with community, leading with relationship and playing with initiatives at top-of-funnel to keep acquiring, knowing that product is our ultimate hook. So, always leading in these campaigns with a product message. In terms of lapsed guests, the teams are always working on a variety of direct initiatives. What I would tell you where I'm excited about, Q1 when we continue to bring newness and get back to those historical levels is our opportunity is not in incremental or growth in our lapsed guests. We have very strong high loyal guest, high retention. The opportunity is in our revenue per guest bed, because we've had less newness to bring to her. So, the team's ability to bring that newness to her and the way that she has continued to respond this year to the newness we have had, when we get back to having more of the historical by having quite a bit of that newness in our performance activities across yoga, run and train, and tennis and play, I'm encouraged with the opportunity. Because we're not trying to bring guests back into the brand. She's remained. What we are doing is leveraging newness to have her continue to engage and spend the way she has, knowing that we have more at the historical level. So, that is where I feel excited about what the team is planning and we'll be able to do. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for joining the call, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
